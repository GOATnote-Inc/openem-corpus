# OpenEM Category Sizing — Emergency Medicine Content Distribution Alignment
#
# OpenEM's category structure and condition counts are independently authored.
# Category weights are informed by the published distribution of emergency
# medicine board examination content areas, which are factual data points
# (not copyrightable expression). The mapping, condition candidates, and
# corpus targets are original OpenEM work product.
#
# This file does NOT reproduce, reconstruct, or derive from any proprietary
# taxonomy, blueprint document, or exam preparation material.
#
# Fields:
#   abem_category: Published EM board content area name (factual reference)
#   openem_categories: Corresponding OpenEM category(ies)
#   weight: Approximate board exam weight (proportion, sums to ~1.0)
#   target_conditions: Target number of OpenEM conditions
#   current_conditions: Count as of v0.3.0 (185 total)
#   delta: Conditions to add
#   priority: P0 (immediate), P1 (next), P2 (final)
