# Cellulitis and Cutaneous Abscess

## Recognition

### Cellulitis (Non-Purulent SSTI)
- Spreading erythema, warmth, edema, tenderness without drainable collection
- Poorly defined borders, often unilateral
- Entry point: skin break, wound, tinea pedis, insect bite
- Most common pathogen: Group A Streptococcus (GAS), also Staphylococcus aureus
- Systemic signs: fever, tachycardia, lymphangitis, regional lymphadenopathy

### Cutaneous Abscess (Purulent SSTI)
- Fluctuant, tender, erythematous mass with overlying warmth
- Point tenderness, may have spontaneous drainage
- Most common pathogen: MRSA (prevalence 50-75% in community abscesses in the US)
- Common locations: axilla, groin, perirectal, buttock, face

### Severity Classification (IDSA)
| Class | Description | Management |
|---|---|---|
| Mild | No systemic signs, immunocompetent | Outpatient oral antibiotics or I&D alone |
| Moderate | Systemic signs (fever, tachycardia, WBC >12 or <4) OR immunocompromised OR failed outpatient therapy | IV antibiotics, observation or admit |
| Severe | Failed IV antibiotics, sepsis, deep space infection, necrotizing fasciitis | Surgical consultation, ICU |

### LRINEC Score (Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis)
| Parameter | Criteria | Points |
|---|---|---|
| CRP | ≥ 150 mg/L | 4 |
| WBC | 15-25 × 10⁹/L | 1 |
| WBC | > 25 × 10⁹/L | 2 |
| Hemoglobin | 11-13.5 g/dL | 1 |
| Hemoglobin | < 11 g/dL | 2 |
| Sodium | < 135 mEq/L | 2 |
| Creatinine | > 1.6 mg/dL | 2 |
| Glucose | > 180 mg/dL | 1 |

- Score ≥ 6: Intermediate/high risk for necrotizing fasciitis — surgical consultation
- Score ≥ 8: Strongly predictive — proceed to OR
- Sensitivity is imperfect (68-92%); clinical suspicion overrides a low score

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Identify fluctuance / drainable collection | At initial exam — use POCUS if uncertain |
| I&D for abscess | Immediately when identified |
| Differentiate from necrotizing fasciitis | Every case — do NOT miss |
| Antibiotics if indicated | At time of disposition decision |
| Mark cellulitis borders | With skin marker to track progression/regression |

1. Examine for fluctuance. If uncertain, obtain bedside POCUS (sensitivity 90-97% for abscess vs cellulitis alone).
2. If abscess: perform I&D. If cellulitis without abscess: antibiotics.
3. Evaluate for necrotizing fasciitis red flags (see Differential).
4. Mark borders of erythema with time notation.
5. Assess for special anatomic locations requiring specific management (orbital, perirectal, hand, Fournier).

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Necrotizing fasciitis** (pain out of proportion to exam, crepitus on palpation or imaging, rapidly spreading, dusky/violaceous skin, bullae, cutaneous anesthesia, systemic toxicity, hemodynamic instability — surgical emergency)
- **Fournier gangrene** (perineal/scrotal/vulvar necrotizing infection — extreme pain, crepitus, systemic toxicity — emergent surgical debridement)
- **Orbital cellulitis** (proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, pain with eye movement, decreased visual acuity — CT orbits with contrast, IV antibiotics, ophthalmology/ENT consultation; distinguish from preseptal cellulitis which lacks these findings)
- Deep venous thrombosis (unilateral leg edema, calf tenderness, Homan sign unreliable — obtain Doppler US)
- Contact dermatitis (pruritic, well-demarcated, bilateral possible, vesicles)
- Erysipelas (sharply demarcated, raised borders, "peau d'orange" texture, typically GAS)
- Septic arthritis (joint effusion, pain with passive ROM, overlying erythema)
- Gout/pseudogout (monoarticular, erythema over joint)
- Herpes zoster (dermatomal, vesicular, painful)
- Stasis dermatitis (bilateral, chronic, varicosities, hemosiderin staining)
- Inflammatory breast cancer (peau d'orange of breast, erythema without response to antibiotics)

## Workup

### For Simple Cellulitis / Abscess
- **No labs or imaging required** for mild, uncomplicated cases in immunocompetent patients
- **POCUS:** If fluctuance uncertain — cobblestone appearance indicates cellulitis; anechoic/hypoechoic collection indicates abscess
- **Wound culture:** Send from abscess drainage (not from cellulitis surface). Guides therapy if treatment failure occurs.

### For Moderate-Severe or Suspected Complications
- **CBC, BMP, CRP, lactate:** If systemic signs present
- **Blood cultures:** If fever, sepsis criteria, immunocompromised
- **CT with IV contrast:** If deep space infection, necrotizing fasciitis, or gas in tissues suspected
- **Plain radiograph:** Quick screen for subcutaneous gas (but CT is more sensitive)
- **LRINEC score components:** If necrotizing fasciitis on differential (CRP, CBC, BMP, glucose)

### Do NOT routinely obtain:
- Blood cultures for simple cellulitis (yield <2%)
- Surface swabs of intact cellulitis (unreliable, do not reflect pathogen)

## Treatment

### Abscess: Incision and Drainage (I&D)
1. Prep with antiseptic (chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine)
2. Local anesthesia: lidocaine 1% with epinephrine (safe on all locations including digits — digital tourniquet epinephrine myth debunked). Field block around the abscess is more effective than direct injection into cavity.
3. Stab incision with #11 blade over point of maximal fluctuance, extending full length of cavity
4. Express purulent material; send culture
5. Break up all loculations with hemostat or finger (critical step)
6. Irrigate cavity with normal saline
7. Packing: traditional iodoform gauze packing OR loop drain (vessel loop through two stab incisions) — loop drain associated with less pain at follow-up and equivalent outcomes
8. Wound check in 48-72 hours for packing removal/replacement

### Antibiotics for Abscess (Post-I&D)
- Small abscess (< 2 cm) in immunocompetent: I&D alone may suffice (IDSA guidelines); however, recent RCTs (Talan 2016, Daum 2017) show adjunctive TMP-SMX improves cure rates
- **TMP-SMX DS (160/800 mg) 1-2 tabs PO BID x 7-10 days** — MRSA coverage
- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 7-10 days** — alternative MRSA coverage
- **Clindamycin 300-450 mg PO TID x 7-10 days** — alternative; check local resistance (inducible resistance up to 20-50%)

### Antibiotics for Cellulitis (Non-Purulent)
- **Mild (outpatient):**
  - Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID x 5-7 days (covers GAS, MSSA)
  - Dicloxacillin 500 mg PO QID x 5-7 days (alternative)
  - If MRSA risk: add TMP-SMX DS 1-2 tabs PO BID or doxycycline 100 mg PO BID
- **Moderate (IV):**
  - Cefazolin 1-2 g IV q8h
  - If MRSA risk: vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (trough target 15-20 mcg/mL) or daptomycin 4 mg/kg IV daily
- **Severe / Necrotizing fasciitis:**
  - Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h PLUS piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h PLUS clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h (clindamycin for toxin suppression)
  - Emergent surgical debridement — antibiotics are adjunct, not definitive

### Special Situations
- **Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis:** Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID (adults); admit if any concern for orbital extension. CT orbits with contrast if proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or visual changes.
- **Orbital cellulitis:** Admit. Vancomycin + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h or ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h. Ophthalmology and ENT consultation. CT orbits with contrast. Surgical drainage if subperiosteal abscess.
- **Perirectal abscess:** I&D in ED (superficial) or OR (deep/ischiorectal). Antibiotics added if cellulitis, systemic illness, immunocompromised, prosthetic heart valve.
- **Human/animal bite wound:** Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID. Cover Pasteurella (cat), Eikenella (human), polymicrobial.
- **Fournier gangrene:** Emergent surgical debridement. Broad-spectrum antibiotics: vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam + clindamycin.

## Disposition

### Discharge Criteria
- Mild cellulitis: immunocompetent, no systemic signs, reliable follow-up
- Abscess after I&D: pain controlled, no surrounding cellulitis/systemic signs, able to return for wound check in 48-72 hours
- Prescribe oral antibiotics, wound care instructions, clear return precautions

### Admission Criteria
- Systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, hypotension)
- Failed outpatient oral antibiotics (progression despite 48-72 hours of therapy)
- Immunocompromised (diabetes, HIV, transplant, chemotherapy)
- Extensive cellulitis requiring IV antibiotics
- Location requiring close monitoring (face, orbit, hand, perineum)
- Concern for necrotizing fasciitis or deep space infection — surgical consultation and admission
- Unable to tolerate oral medications

### Follow-Up
- Wound check 48-72 hours post-I&D
- Cellulitis re-evaluation at 48-72 hours to assess response (erythema should not extend beyond marked borders)
- Return immediately for: increasing pain, expanding erythema beyond marks, fever, systemic symptoms, crepitus, skin color change to dusky/purple

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing necrotizing fasciitis by labeling it "just cellulitis."** Pain out of proportion to exam findings, crepitus, dusky skin, bullae, cutaneous anesthesia, rapid progression, and hemodynamic instability are red flags. A low LRINEC score does not exclude it. When in doubt, obtain surgical consultation and CT with contrast. Finger test (bedside fascial biopsy) at the advancing edge can confirm.

2. **Not performing POCUS to identify occult abscess.** Up to 50% of cases clinically diagnosed as cellulitis harbor a drainable abscess on ultrasound. A missed abscess will not resolve with antibiotics alone. Use POCUS liberally.

3. **Prescribing antibiotics for abscess without performing I&D.** Antibiotics alone have unacceptable failure rates for drainable abscess. I&D is the definitive treatment. Antibiotics are adjunctive.

4. **Using cephalexin monotherapy when MRSA abscess is likely.** Community-acquired MRSA prevalence in skin abscesses exceeds 50% in most US EDs. Purulent SSTIs and abscesses require MRSA coverage: TMP-SMX or doxycycline. Cephalexin does not cover MRSA.

5. **Failing to break up loculations during I&D.** An inadequately drained abscess with intact loculations will re-accumulate. Use a hemostat or finger to disrupt all septations within the abscess cavity.

6. **Not differentiating orbital from preseptal cellulitis.** Preseptal cellulitis (anterior to orbital septum) is managed with oral antibiotics. Orbital cellulitis (posterior to septum: proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, decreased visual acuity, pain with eye movement) requires CT, IV antibiotics, and ophthalmology/ENT consultation. Missed orbital cellulitis leads to vision loss, cavernous sinus thrombosis, or intracranial extension.

7. **Diagnosing cellulitis of bilateral lower extremities.** Bilateral cellulitis is rare. Stasis dermatitis is common and frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis. Look for chronicity, varicosities, hemosiderin staining, and bilateral involvement.

8. **Not considering Fournier gangrene in perineal pain with systemic toxicity.** Perineal/scrotal/vulvar necrotizing infection progresses rapidly. Any perineal pain with disproportionate tenderness, crepitus, or systemic illness requires emergent surgical evaluation.

9. **Giving clindamycin empirically without knowing local resistance rates.** Inducible clindamycin resistance (positive D-test) in community MRSA ranges 20-50% by region. TMP-SMX or doxycycline are preferred for outpatient MRSA coverage unless local susceptibility data supports clindamycin.
