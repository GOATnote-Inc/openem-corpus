# Pediatric Supracondylar Humerus Fracture

## Recognition

**Most common elbow fracture in children (60% of pediatric elbow fractures):**
- Peak age: 5-7 years
- Mechanism: fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH) with hyperextension (98% extension-type)
- Swollen, painful elbow with refusal to move
- S-shaped deformity of elbow (posterior displacement of olecranon)
- Ecchymosis in antecubital fossa

**Gartland classification (extension-type):**
- Type I: non-displaced (anterior humeral line passes through capitellum)
- Type II: displaced with intact posterior cortex (hinged); may be angulated
- Type III: completely displaced (no cortical contact) — neurovascular injury risk highest

**Neurovascular complications (15-20% of Type III):**
- **Anterior interosseous nerve (AIN)** — most commonly injured; test: pinch (OK sign); inability to flex DIP of index finger and thumb IP
- **Median nerve** — test: opposition, 2-point discrimination of index finger
- **Radial nerve** — test: wrist/finger extension, thumb extension
- **Brachial artery injury** — absent radial pulse, pallor, pain with passive finger extension (compartment syndrome)
- **Volkmann ischemic contracture:** forearm compartment syndrome from vascular compromise → irreversible flexor compartment necrosis

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Neurovascular exam (5 P's) | Before and after any manipulation |
| Splinting in position of comfort | Immediate |
| Orthopedic consultation | Immediate for Type II-III |
| Emergent OR for vascular compromise | < 2 hours |

1. **Complete neurovascular exam** — document radial pulse, AIN, median, radial, ulnar nerve function; capillary refill of each digit
2. **Remove any constricting jewelry, clothing**
3. **Splint in position found** — posterior long-arm splint with elbow at 30-40 degrees flexion (more flexion may compromise vascular flow; do NOT flex > 90 degrees)
4. **Serial neurovascular checks every 30 minutes** while in ED
5. **Orthopedic consultation** — Type I: splint and follow-up; Type II-III: emergent or urgent surgical fixation
6. **Vascular surgery consultation** if pulseless and remains pulseless after reduction

## Differential Diagnosis

- Lateral condyle fracture (tenderness lateral, valgus mechanism)
- Medial epicondyle avulsion (tenderness medial, valgus stress, ulnar nerve symptoms)
- Elbow dislocation (olecranon prominent posteriorly, loss of triangular relationship)
- Radial head/neck fracture (tenderness over radial head, pain with pronation/supination)
- Olecranon fracture (palpable gap, inability to extend elbow)
- Non-accidental trauma (inconsistent mechanism, multiple fractures of varying ages)
- Nursemaid's elbow (radial head subluxation — younger age, arm held pronated/adducted, no swelling)

## Workup

- **AP and lateral elbow X-rays** — minimum; true lateral is critical for classification
- **Anterior humeral line:** draw on lateral X-ray; should pass through middle third of capitellum. If anterior to capitellum → posterior displacement = supracondylar fracture
- **Posterior fat pad sign:** always pathologic; indicates intra-articular effusion/fracture
- **Anterior fat pad:** elevated (sail sign) suggests occult fracture
- **Baumann angle** (AP view): angle between humeral shaft and lateral condyle physis; compare to contralateral side
- **CT:** rarely needed; may help evaluate comminution or atypical fracture patterns
- **Doppler ultrasound or CT angiography:** if pulseless after reduction; assess brachial artery injury
- **Compartment pressures:** if clinical suspicion for compartment syndrome (pain with passive extension, tense forearm, increasing analgesic requirement)

## Treatment

### Type I (Non-Displaced)
- **Posterior long-arm splint** with elbow at 60-90 degrees flexion
- **Sling** for comfort
- **Orthopedic follow-up** in 5-7 days for repeat X-rays
- **Ice, elevation, ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO q6h (max 40 mg/kg/day)** for pain

### Type II (Angulated, Posterior Cortex Intact)
- **Closed reduction under procedural sedation** in ED (if orthopedics delays)
- **Posterior long-arm splint** post-reduction; elbow at 60-90 degrees flexion
- **Admit or urgent OR** — most Type II fractures require percutaneous pinning within 24 hours

### Type III (Completely Displaced)
- **Emergent orthopedic consultation** — closed reduction and percutaneous pinning under general anesthesia
- **Splint in position of comfort** pending surgery
- **Do NOT attempt reduction in ED** unless vascular compromise mandates immediate action
- **If pulseless:** gentle reduction to improve alignment; reassess pulse; if remains pulseless after reduction → emergent vascular exploration

### Vascular Compromise
- **"Pink, pulseless" hand:** dopplerable signal present; collateral circulation adequate → close observation with serial checks q30min; may proceed to OR for pinning with vascular standby
- **"White, pulseless" hand:** no dopplerable signal; true ischemia → emergent surgical exploration of brachial artery AND fracture fixation
- **Compartment syndrome:** emergent fasciotomy + fracture fixation

### Procedural Sedation for Closed Reduction
- **Ketamine 1.5 mg/kg IV** (preferred in pediatrics) with glycopyrrolate 0.005 mg/kg IV
- OR **propofol 1 mg/kg IV** titrated
- **Intranasal fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg** for pre-procedural analgesia

## Disposition

- **Type I:** Discharge with posterior long-arm splint; orthopedic follow-up 5-7 days; strict return precautions for neurovascular changes (numbness, color change, worsening pain)
- **Type II:** Admission or urgent OR within 24 hours for pinning
- **Type III:** Emergent OR for closed reduction and percutaneous pinning
- **Vascular compromise:** Emergent OR; possible vascular repair
- **All patients:** written neurovascular check instructions for parents (check fingers for color, sensation, movement every 2 hours for first 24 hours)

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing the posterior fat pad sign on lateral X-ray.** A posterior fat pad is ALWAYS pathologic and indicates an occult fracture. A "normal" X-ray with a posterior fat pad should be treated as an occult supracondylar fracture: splint and orthopedic follow-up.

2. **Flexing the elbow beyond 90 degrees to "reduce" swelling.** Excessive flexion compresses the brachial artery and can convert a pulsatile to a pulseless limb. Splint at 30-40 degrees if there is any concern for vascular compromise.

3. **Failing to document a complete neurovascular exam before and after manipulation.** AIN palsy is the most common nerve injury and is tested by the "OK sign" (DIP flexion of index finger + thumb IP flexion). If not documented pre-reduction, a post-reduction deficit cannot be attributed to the injury vs. the intervention.

4. **Discharging a "pink but pulseless" hand without orthopedic follow-up within hours.** A pink pulseless hand indicates collateral perfusion, but the brachial artery may still be injured. These patients need close observation and imaging (Doppler or CTA) to rule out intimal injury or thrombosis.

5. **Attributing refusal to move the arm in a young child to "nursemaid's elbow" without X-rays.** Supracondylar fractures and nursemaid's elbow overlap in age and mechanism. Any child with elbow swelling, deformity, or point tenderness needs X-rays before attempting supination/flexion reduction maneuver.
