# Snakebite Envenomation

## Recognition

**Epidemiology:** Approximately 7,000–8,000 pit viper bites per year in the US. Of the 120+ snake species in North America, approximately 20 are venomous: pit vipers (Crotalinae — rattlesnakes, copperhead, cottonmouth) account for the vast majority; coral snakes (Elapidae) account for < 1%.

**Dry Bite:** 20–25% of pit viper strikes inject no venom. Absence of local findings at 30–60 minutes does not guarantee a dry bite — recheck at 6 hours.

**Crotalinae (Pit Viper) — Cytotoxic/Hemotoxic Venom:**

**Local Findings:**
- Fang marks (one or two puncture wounds)
- Immediate burning pain at bite site
- Progressive edema tracking proximally (mark advancing edge with pen every 15–30 minutes)
- Ecchymosis, petechiae, vesiculation, bullae
- Necrosis (delayed, hours to days)

**Systemic Findings:**
- Coagulopathy: spontaneous bleeding (gingival, IV sites), prolonged PT/PTT, thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer (venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy)
- Hypotension, tachycardia (early vasodilation or hemorrhagic shock)
- Nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis (systemic toxin absorption)
- Neurotoxicity (primarily Mojave rattlesnake type A, timber rattlesnake): myokymia, fasciculations, diplopia, ptosis, dysarthria, respiratory depression

**Elapidae (Coral Snake) — Neurotoxic Venom:**
- Local findings minimal or absent — do not underestimate based on local exam
- Envenomation may be delayed 6–12 hours before systemic signs appear
- Progressive ascending paralysis: ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, limb weakness
- Respiratory failure from neuromuscular blockade — may be delayed but rapid once it begins
- Eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius): most dangerous North American coral snake; found in southeastern US
- Mnemonic: "Red on yellow, kill a fellow; red on black, friend of Jack" — applies to US species only, unreliable for non-native snakes

**Envenomation Severity Grading (Pit Viper):**
| Grade | Features |
|-------|----------|
| None (dry bite) | No local or systemic signs at 6 hours |
| Mild | Local pain, edema < 15 cm from bite, no systemic symptoms, normal labs |
| Moderate | Edema 15–30 cm, systemic symptoms, mild lab abnormalities (platelets 100–150k, fibrinogen 100–200) |
| Severe | Edema > 30 cm, rapidly progressive, compartment syndrome, hemorrhage, shock, severe coagulopathy (platelets < 100k, fibrinogen < 100, spontaneous bleeding) |

## Critical Actions

1. **Remove patient from snake.** Do not attempt to capture or kill the snake — secondary bites are common. Photograph if possible for identification.

2. **Remove constrictive items immediately** — rings, watches, clothing, tourniquets — distal to the bite. Edema progresses rapidly.

3. **Mark advancing edema edge** with pen every 15–30 minutes. Note time of bite, first symptom onset, and arrival.

4. **Two large-bore IVs, continuous cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry.** Supplemental oxygen.

5. **Labs immediately:** CBC with differential and platelets, BMP, PT/INR/PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, CK (rhabdomyolysis), LFTs, urinalysis (hemoglobinuria/myoglobinuria), type and screen.

6. **Call Poison Control immediately: 1-800-222-1222.** Toxicologist guidance is recommended for all envenomations. They will advise on antivenom dosing, monitoring intervals, and disposition.

7. **Antivenom for all symptomatic envenomations** — do not wait for severe manifestations. Administer when progression of local findings OR any systemic/hematologic effects present. Antivenom reverses coagulopathy and halts tissue destruction; it does not reverse established necrosis.

8. **Immobilize bitten extremity at heart level** — elevation increases coagulopathy risk; dependency worsens edema. Immobilize in functional position.

9. **Tetanus prophylaxis** — administer if not up to date.

10. **Serial compartment pressure measurements** if tenseness of the extremity suggests compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy is rarely indicated (< 1% of cases) and only when compartment pressures > 30 mmHg or delta pressure < 30 mmHg despite adequate antivenom.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Dry bite (non-envenomed strike) | No pain progression, no edema at 6 hours, normal labs |
| Non-venomous snake bite | Small scratch or abrasion, no pain, no systemic signs, no coagulopathy |
| Allergic reaction to bite | Urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis within minutes — may coexist with envenomation |
| Cellulitis/SSTI | Gradual onset, warmth, erythema, no fang marks, indolent progression over days |
| Compartment syndrome (traumatic) | No venom exposure, tense compartment, trauma history |
| Disseminated intravascular coagulation | Underlying infection/malignancy, no snakebite, different labs pattern |

## Workup

**Immediate Labs:**
- CBC: platelet count (venom thrombocytopenia)
- Coagulation: PT, INR, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer (venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy)
- BMP: creatinine (AKI), electrolytes
- CK: rhabdomyolysis from necrosis
- LFTs
- Urinalysis: myoglobinuria, hemoglobinuria
- Type and screen

**Serial Monitoring:**
- Repeat CBC, coagulation panel, and fibrinogen at 1–2 hours after initial dose, at point of initial control, and at 6, 12, and 18 hours from initial control
- Repeat labs 2–3 days and 5–7 days post-discharge (late-onset coagulopathy risk)

**Imaging:**
- Extremity X-ray: exclude retained fang or underlying fracture
- Consider serial compartment pressure if clinical concern for compartment syndrome

## Treatment

**Antivenom — First-Line Definitive Treatment:**

Two FDA-approved antivenoms for North American crotaline envenomation:

**CroFab (Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab, ovine-derived):**
- Initial dose: 4–6 vials IV (use 4 vials for mild-moderate; 6 vials for severe/rapidly progressing envenomation)
- Mix in 250 mL NS, infuse over 60 minutes; start at 25–50 mL/hr for first 10 minutes, then increase to complete over 1 hour
- Reassess at 1 hour — if initial control not achieved (edema still progressing, labs not improving, systemic signs persist), administer 4–6 additional vials
- Maintenance dosing once initial control achieved: 2 vials IV at 6, 12, and 18 hours
- Shorter half-life (~15 hours) — higher rate of late coagulopathy recurrence

**ANAVIP (Crotalidae Immune F(ab')2, equine-derived):**
- Initial dose: 10 vials IV for all patients regardless of age or severity
- Mix 10 vials in 250 mL NS, infuse over 60 minutes (start at 25–50 mL/hr for first 10 minutes)
- Reassess at 1 hour — if initial control not achieved, give additional 10 vials
- Longer half-life (~5.5 days) — significantly lower rate of late recurrent thrombocytopenia compared to CroFab
- Maintenance: 4 vials IV at 6 and 18 hours after initial control, if needed

**Antivenom Infusion Reactions:**
- Acute hypersensitivity in 5–10% of patients (less common with Fab fragments than whole IgG antivenom)
- Stop infusion, give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, consider epinephrine 0.3 mg IM for anaphylaxis
- Restart antivenom at slower rate once controlled — the benefits of antivenom outweigh allergy risk in envenomation

**Coral Snake (Elapidae) Envenomation:**
- No currently available FDA-approved antivenom in the US (North American Coral Snake Antivenom exhausted; US production discontinued)
- Contact Poison Control (1-800-222-1222) and regional zoos/toxicology centers for investigational/foreign antivenom access
- Aggressive supportive care: intubation and mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure
- Neostigmine and atropine may partially reverse neuromuscular blockade as a bridge

**Supportive Care:**
- IV crystalloid bolus for hypotension: 1–2 L NS or LR; avoid excessive fluid (worsens edema)
- Blood products for severe hemorrhage unresponsive to antivenom: pRBC, FFP, cryoprecipitate (fibrinogen)
- Platelets: transfuse only for active bleeding with thrombocytopenia — platelet transfusion will be consumed by ongoing venom-mediated destruction; antivenom is the treatment
- Opioid analgesia: morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV for pain; NSAIDs contraindicated (worsens coagulopathy)
- Wound care: gentle irrigation with saline; no incision, no suction, no tourniquets

**Fasciotomy — Rarely Indicated:**
- Only when compartment pressure > 30 mmHg (or delta pressure < 30 mmHg) despite adequate antivenom dosing
- Most apparent compartment syndrome in snakebite is due to tissue edema, not true compartment syndrome — antivenom is the primary treatment
- Premature fasciotomy worsens infection risk, tissue loss, and poor outcomes

## Disposition

**ICU Admission:**
- Severe envenomation with grade 3–4 coagulopathy
- Hemodynamic instability
- Respiratory compromise (coral snake neurotoxicity)
- Ongoing hemorrhage
- Compartment syndrome requiring surgical management

**Floor/Telemetry Admission (minimum 24 hours):**
- All symptomatic envenomations requiring antivenom
- Moderate envenomation with lab abnormalities
- Must monitor for late-onset coagulopathy (peaks 2–4 days post-envenomation with CroFab)

**Observation (8–12 hours) then Discharge:**
- Mild envenomation with normal labs at 6 hours and stable local findings
- Dry bites confirmed at 6 hours with completely normal labs and no progressive symptoms

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Return for bleeding (gingival, IV sites, hematuria), worsening swelling, bruising, neurological symptoms
- Follow-up labs at days 2–3 and days 5–7 (late coagulopathy monitoring, required by antivenom prescribing guidelines)
- No NSAIDs, no aspirin, no alcohol, no anticoagulants until confirmed coagulopathy resolution

## Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating envenomation severity because local findings are mild.** Local swelling does not correlate with coagulopathy severity. Severe venom-induced consumptive coagulopathy can occur with minimal local tissue effect (e.g., Mojave rattlesnake, canebrake rattlesnake). Obtain labs on all bite patients regardless of local appearance.

2. **Delaying antivenom while waiting for "severe" symptoms.** Antivenom is most effective early, before tissue necrosis becomes established and before coagulopathy causes hemorrhage. The decision to treat is based on progressive local findings or any systemic/lab effects — not on waiting for shock or major bleeding.

3. **Withholding antivenom in patients with prior antivenom allergy or venom allergy history.** Prior antivenom administration is a risk factor for hypersensitivity but not a contraindication. The alternative — untreated severe envenomation — carries higher mortality. Pre-treat with diphenhydramine, have epinephrine at bedside, infuse slowly, and treat reactions as they occur.

4. **Missing late-onset recurrent coagulopathy after CroFab treatment.** CroFab's short Fab half-life (~15 hours) means venom may outlast the antivenom, causing coagulopathy recurrence 2–4 days after treatment. Patients treated with CroFab must have labs repeated at days 2–3 and 5–7 post-discharge. A patient discharged with normal labs can re-present with life-threatening coagulopathy within 72 hours.

5. **Performing fasciotomy before adequate antivenom.** Most compartment syndrome-like presentations in snakebite are caused by venom-mediated tissue edema, not true ischemic compartment syndrome. Unnecessary fasciotomy dramatically worsens outcomes — it does not reverse envenomation and creates open wounds at risk for secondary infection and necrosis. Antivenom first, then measure compartment pressures; fasciotomy only if pressures remain critically elevated after antivenom.

6. **Dismissing coral snake bites based on absent local findings.** Eastern coral snake envenomation may produce no immediate local reaction. Neurotoxic paralysis is delayed 6–12 hours but progresses to respiratory failure. Any confirmed or suspected coral snake bite requires hospital admission for minimum 24-hour observation regardless of initial appearance.

7. **Applying harmful first aid.** Incision, suction, tourniquets, ice, electric shock — all are contraindicated and cause additional tissue damage. These interventions do not remove clinically significant venom and delay transport to definitive care. Remove constricting items, immobilize the extremity at heart level, and transport.
