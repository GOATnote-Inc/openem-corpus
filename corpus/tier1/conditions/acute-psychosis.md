# Acute Psychosis

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute onset of impaired reality testing characterized by delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thought/speech, or grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior. The ED role is to identify and treat medical causes, ensure safety, and initiate stabilization.

**Primary Psychiatric Causes:**
- Schizophrenia (first break or exacerbation)
- Schizoaffective disorder
- Bipolar disorder (manic psychosis)
- Major depressive disorder with psychotic features
- Brief psychotic disorder

**Medical Causes (must be excluded):**
- Substance intoxication: sympathomimetics (methamphetamine, cocaine, synthetic cathinones), PCP, ketamine, cannabis (especially high-THC/synthetic), hallucinogens (LSD, psilocybin)
- Substance withdrawal: alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates
- CNS infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess
- Metabolic: hypoglycemia, hypo/hypernatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, thyrotoxicosis, Addisonian crisis, hypercalcemia
- Neurologic: stroke, seizure (postictal), CNS tumor, traumatic brain injury, autoimmune encephalitis (anti-NMDAR)
- Medication-induced: corticosteroids, anticholinergics, dopamine agonists, fluoroquinolones
- Delirium (any cause)

**Red Flags for Medical Etiology:**
- Age > 40 with no psychiatric history
- Acute onset (hours, not days/weeks)
- Visual hallucinations (more common in organic causes vs. auditory in primary psychosis)
- Vital sign abnormalities (fever, tachycardia, hypertension, hypoxia)
- Altered level of consciousness (waxing/waning = delirium)
- Focal neurologic deficits
- No prior psychiatric history

## Critical Actions

1. **Safety first** — de-escalation, 1:1 observation, remove potential weapons from the room, ensure staff safety. Metal detectors/wand search per institutional protocol.
2. **Exclude medical causes** — targeted history, physical exam, vital signs, glucose, toxicology. New-onset psychosis in a patient > 40 without psychiatric history requires workup for organic cause.
3. **Verbal de-escalation before pharmacologic restraint** — use calm, respectful, low-stimulation approach. Offer food, water, a quiet environment.
4. **Chemical sedation** for agitated patients who are a danger to self or others and fail verbal de-escalation. Do not delay when safety is at risk.
5. **Physical restraints** — apply only when chemical sedation is insufficient or pending onset. Monitor restrained patients continuously for respiratory compromise, circulation, and aspiration.
6. **Check glucose** — hypoglycemia mimics psychosis and is immediately treatable. Dextrose 50% 50 mL IV if glucose < 60 mg/dL.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Delirium | Fluctuating consciousness, inattention, acute medical illness, visual hallucinations |
| Substance intoxication | Toxicology positive, sympathomimetic syndrome, temporal relationship to use |
| Alcohol/benzo withdrawal | Tremor, diaphoresis, tachycardia, seizure history, last drink timing |
| Anti-NMDAR encephalitis | Young woman, psychiatric symptoms progressing to seizures/dyskinesias/autonomic instability, CSF antibodies |
| Thyrotoxicosis | Tachycardia, tremor, weight loss, thyromegaly, elevated free T4 |
| CNS infection | Fever, headache, meningismus, focal deficits, CSF pleocytosis |
| Temporal lobe seizure | Automatisms, post-ictal confusion, EEG abnormalities |
| Acute mania (bipolar) | Elevated/irritable mood, pressured speech, decreased sleep, grandiosity; may have psychotic features |

## Workup

**All Acute Psychosis Presentations:**
- Point-of-care glucose
- Complete vital signs including temperature
- Urine drug screen (amphetamines, cocaine, PCP, cannabinoids, opioids)
- Blood alcohol level
- SpO2

**First-Break Psychosis or Suspected Medical Etiology:**
- CBC
- BMP (sodium, calcium, glucose, renal function)
- TSH
- Urinalysis
- LFTs, ammonia (hepatic encephalopathy)
- Head CT without contrast (mass, hemorrhage, stroke)
- Lumbar puncture (if meningitis/encephalitis suspected — fever, headache, meningismus)
- ESR/CRP
- HIV testing
- B12, folate (if nutritional deficiency suspected)
- Anti-NMDAR antibodies (if young female with progressive psychiatric symptoms + movement disorder or autonomic instability)
- EEG (if subclinical seizures suspected)

**ACEP 2012 Guidance:** For known psychiatric patients with no new medical complaints, normal vital signs, and a normal exam: routine laboratory testing is low yield. Focus workup on clinical suspicion.

## Treatment

**De-escalation (first-line):**
- Low-stimulation environment: dim lights, reduce noise, single room
- One staff member speaks calmly using short sentences
- Offer oral medications, food, water
- Maintain safe distance, avoid cornering the patient
- Avoid arguing about delusions

**Pharmacologic Sedation for Acute Agitation:**

*Oral (cooperative patient):*
- Olanzapine 5-10 mg PO (onset 30-45 min)
- Risperidone 2 mg PO (onset 30-45 min)
- Lorazepam 2 mg PO (onset 30-60 min)
- Combination: risperidone 2 mg PO + lorazepam 2 mg PO

*IM (uncooperative patient):*
- First-line: olanzapine 10 mg IM (onset 15-30 min) — do NOT combine with IM benzodiazepines (respiratory depression risk)
- Alternative: haloperidol 5-10 mg IM + diphenhydramine 50 mg IM (prevents dystonia) ± lorazepam 2 mg IM (the "B52": Benadryl 50 + haloperidol 5 + Ativan 2)
- Midazolam 5 mg IM (fastest onset IM: 5-15 min; short duration 1-2 hours)
- Ziprasidone 20 mg IM (onset 15-30 min; avoid in QTc prolongation)
- Droperidol 5-10 mg IM (rapid onset 5-10 min; obtain ECG for QTc monitoring)

*IV (severe agitation with IV access):*
- Midazolam 2-5 mg IV (onset 2-3 min)
- Haloperidol 5-10 mg IV + diphenhydramine 50 mg IV
- Lorazepam 2-4 mg IV

*Ketamine (extreme agitation/excited delirium):*
- Ketamine 4-5 mg/kg IM or 1-2 mg/kg IV for severe agitation unresponsive to standard agents
- Prepare for intubation — airway management equipment at bedside

**Antipsychotic Monitoring:**
- ECG for QTc before or shortly after haloperidol, droperidol, ziprasidone
- QTc > 500 ms: avoid antipsychotics with QT-prolongation risk; use benzodiazepines
- Monitor for dystonia (treat with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV/IM or benztropine 1-2 mg IV/IM)
- Monitor for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (hyperthermia, rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic instability, elevated CK)

**Physical Restraints:**
- 4-point restraints if chemical sedation insufficient
- Continuous monitoring: vitals q15 min, circulation checks, respiratory status
- Supine or lateral decubitus position (NEVER prone — positional asphyxia risk)
- Reassess need for continued restraint q1 hour
- Document indication, type, duration, monitoring

## Disposition

**Medical Admission / ICU:**
- Identified medical etiology (encephalitis, stroke, metabolic derangement)
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
- Significant overdose/intoxication requiring monitoring
- Excited delirium syndrome (rhabdomyolysis, hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis)

**Psychiatric Admission (voluntary or involuntary):**
- Active suicidal or homicidal ideation with intent/plan
- Inability to care for self (gravely disabled)
- First-break psychosis (requires inpatient workup and medication initiation)
- Failed outpatient management
- Psychosis with persistent agitation requiring ongoing sedation

**Discharge (rare for acute psychosis):**
- Known psychiatric patient with mild exacerbation, now at baseline, no safety concerns
- Reliable outpatient follow-up within 24-72 hours confirmed
- Responsible caregiver at home
- Lethal means counseling completed
- Crisis line numbers provided

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming psychosis is psychiatric without excluding medical causes.** Hypoglycemia, CNS infection, intoxication, anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and metabolic derangements all present with psychosis. A glucose check takes 5 seconds. A missed encephalitis kills. New-onset psychosis after age 40 has a medical cause until proven otherwise.

2. **Delaying sedation in a dangerous patient.** Verbal de-escalation is first-line, but an actively violent patient poses immediate risk to staff, other patients, and themselves. Prompt chemical sedation with IM medications (olanzapine 10 mg IM, or haloperidol 5 mg + diphenhydramine 50 mg + lorazepam 2 mg IM) prevents injury. Waiting too long to medicate causes harm.

3. **Combining IM olanzapine with IM benzodiazepines.** This combination carries significant risk of respiratory depression, hypotension, and death. The package insert contraindicates concurrent IM administration. Use haloperidol-based IM regimens if a benzodiazepine is also needed.

4. **Prone restraint causing positional asphyxia.** Restraining agitated patients in the prone position, especially obese patients or those intoxicated with stimulants, causes positional asphyxia and death. Restrain in supine or lateral decubitus position only. Continuous monitoring of respiratory effort is mandatory.

5. **Forgetting dystonia prophylaxis with haloperidol.** Acute dystonia (laryngospasm, torticollis, oculogyric crisis) occurs in up to 10% of patients receiving haloperidol, particularly young males. Co-administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IM/IV with every haloperidol dose.

6. **Not checking QTc.** Haloperidol, droperidol, and ziprasidone prolong the QT interval. Torsades de pointes from antipsychotic-induced QTc prolongation is a preventable death. Obtain an ECG; if QTc > 500 ms, use benzodiazepines instead.

7. **Missing anti-NMDAR encephalitis.** Young women presenting with new-onset psychosis, seizures, movement disorders (orofacial dyskinesias), and progressive autonomic instability may have anti-NMDAR encephalitis, often associated with ovarian teratoma. This is treatable with immunotherapy and tumor resection. Early diagnosis prevents ICU admission and death.

8. **Inadequate monitoring of restrained/sedated patients.** Chemical sedation plus physical restraints is the highest-risk combination. Patients die from respiratory depression, aspiration, and rhabdomyolysis. Vitals q15 min, continuous pulse oximetry, circulation checks, and airway monitoring are non-negotiable.

9. **Discharging first-break psychosis from the ED.** First-episode psychosis requires inpatient psychiatric evaluation, medical workup, and supervised medication initiation. ED discharge of a first-break psychotic patient without definitive psychiatric follow-up is unsafe.
