# Perforated Peptic Ulcer

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Sudden-onset severe epigastric pain ("thunderclap" abdominal pain)
- Pain rapidly becomes diffuse as peritoneal contamination spreads
- History of PUD, NSAID use, H. pylori infection, smoking, alcohol
- Prior epigastric pain or dyspepsia in 60-80% of cases
- Patients with chronic steroid use or immunosuppression may have blunted symptoms

**Temporal phases:**
1. Chemical peritonitis (0-2 hours): sudden severe epigastric pain, board-like rigidity
2. Intermediate phase (2-12 hours): pain may transiently improve (bacterial contamination evolving)
3. Intra-abdominal sepsis (> 12 hours): frank peritonitis, sepsis, shock

**Exam findings:**
- Board-like abdominal rigidity
- Diffuse rebound tenderness, guarding
- Absent bowel sounds
- Tachycardia, hypotension in advanced cases
- Fever (may be absent early)
- Referred shoulder pain (diaphragmatic irritation from free air)

## Critical Actions

1. **Immediate IV crystalloid resuscitation** — 2 L bolus, target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
2. **NPO, nasogastric tube to suction** — reduce ongoing contamination
3. **IV PPI:** pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus, then 8 mg/hr continuous infusion
4. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately:** piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR ceftriaxone 2 g IV + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
5. **Emergent surgical consultation** — do not delay for imaging if clinical picture is clear
6. **Urgent upright CXR or CT** — identify pneumoperitoneum
7. **Type and screen, crossmatch 2 units PRBCs**
8. **Foley catheter** — monitor urine output (target > 0.5 mL/kg/hr)
9. **Analgesic:** IV opioids after surgical consultation (do not delay surgical assessment for imaging or labs)

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute pancreatitis** — epigastric pain radiating to back, elevated lipase > 3x ULN, no free air
- **Acute cholecystitis** — RUQ pain, Murphy sign, gallbladder wall thickening on US
- **Acute mesenteric ischemia** — pain out of proportion to exam, atrial fibrillation, elevated lactate
- **Acute appendicitis (perforated)** — RLQ predominance, migration from periumbilical pain
- **Aortic dissection/ruptured AAA** — pulsatile mass, hypotension, back pain, CT angiography diagnostic
- **Myocardial infarction** — ECG changes, troponin elevation (epigastric pain mimics inferior MI)
- **Boerhaave syndrome** — post-emesis, left-sided effusion, pneumomediastinum

## Workup

- **Upright chest X-ray:** free air under diaphragm (sensitivity 75-80%)
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (preferred):** free air (sensitivity > 95%), extraluminal contrast if oral given, localize perforation site, assess abscess/collection
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, lipase (exclude pancreatitis), lactate, coagulation studies, type and crossmatch, blood cultures
- **ECG:** exclude acute MI (inferior STEMI can mimic epigastric pain)
- **No role for upper endoscopy** in suspected perforation
- **Absence of free air does NOT exclude perforation** — 15-25% of perforated ulcers show no pneumoperitoneum on CXR

## Treatment

**Resuscitation:**
- Isotonic crystalloid 30 mL/kg as initial bolus
- Vasopressors (norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min) if refractory hypotension after volume
- Blood products as indicated

**Antibiotics:**
- Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (first-line)
- Alternative: meropenem 1 g IV q8h (if beta-lactam allergy to penicillin but tolerates carbapenems)
- Ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h (alternative)
- Duration: 4-7 days postoperatively based on intraoperative findings

**Acid suppression:**
- Pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus then 8 mg/hr IV infusion for 72 hours
- Transition to PO PPI when tolerating diet

**Surgical management (primary treatment):**
- Laparoscopic omental patch repair (Graham patch) — preferred for small perforations (< 2 cm) with < 24h duration
- Open repair via upper midline laparotomy for unstable patients, large perforations, or delayed presentation
- Definitive ulcer surgery (vagotomy + drainage) rarely performed acutely

**Non-operative management (Taylor method — highly selected patients only):**
- Criteria: sealed perforation on contrast CT, hemodynamic stability, improving symptoms, no diffuse peritonitis
- NPO, NG suction, IV PPI, IV antibiotics
- Serial abdominal exams q4-6h
- Conversion to surgery at any sign of deterioration

**Post-operative:**
- H. pylori testing and eradication: clarithromycin 500 mg PO BID + amoxicillin 1 g PO BID + PPI x 14 days
- Discontinue NSAIDs permanently
- Long-term PPI therapy

## Disposition

- **All patients require admission**
- **ICU:** sepsis, hemodynamic instability, multiorgan dysfunction
- **Surgical ward:** post-operative stable patients
- **Surgery within 6-12 hours of diagnosis** — each hour of delay increases mortality
- **No role for outpatient management** of acute perforation

## Pitfalls

1. **Delayed surgery.** Each hour of surgical delay from admission reduces survival by 2.4%. Time to OR is the single most important modifiable factor.

2. **Transient pain improvement misleading clinicians.** The "intermediate phase" (2-12 hours) produces paradoxical symptom improvement before frank peritonitis develops. Serial exams are essential.

3. **Normal CXR excluding perforation.** Free air is absent in 15-25% of perforated ulcers on upright CXR. CT abdomen has > 95% sensitivity and should be obtained when clinical suspicion is high.

4. **Missing perforated ulcer in elderly or immunosuppressed patients.** Chronic steroid use, immunosuppression, and advanced age blunt the peritoneal response. These patients present with less pain and fewer peritoneal signs despite free perforation.

5. **Failing to check ECG.** Inferior STEMI and perforated ulcer share epigastric pain presentations. An ECG must be obtained to exclude cardiac emergency before proceeding to OR.

6. **Not testing for H. pylori post-operatively.** H. pylori eradication reduces recurrence from 30-50% to < 5%. Testing and treating is essential follow-up care.
