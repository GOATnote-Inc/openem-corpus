# Upper Airway Obstruction

## Recognition

**Cardinal sign: stridor**
- Inspiratory stridor = supraglottic or glottic obstruction
- Biphasic stridor = subglottic obstruction (tracheal)
- Expiratory stridor = intrathoracic tracheal/bronchial obstruction
- ABSENCE of stridor with severe distress = near-complete obstruction or exhaustion

**Clinical assessment:**
- Tripod positioning, drooling, voice changes (muffled "hot potato voice")
- Difficulty swallowing secretions
- Intercostal/suprasternal retractions, accessory muscle use
- Cyanosis, agitation → somnolence (impending arrest)
- Universal choking sign (hands at throat) — foreign body

**Common etiologies:**
- **Foreign body aspiration** — sudden onset during eating or play, choking episode
- **Angioedema** — lip/tongue/uvula swelling; histamine-mediated (allergic) or bradykinin-mediated (ACE inhibitor, hereditary)
- **Epiglottitis** — fever, severe sore throat, drooling, "hot potato" voice, rapid onset (now increasingly adults > children post-Hib vaccine)
- **Peritonsillar abscess** — unilateral tonsillar swelling, trismus, uvular deviation, muffled voice
- **Retropharyngeal abscess** — neck stiffness, dysphagia, posterior pharyngeal swelling, fever (CT diagnostic)
- **Ludwig angina** — floor of mouth cellulitis, submandibular swelling, tongue elevation, dental source
- **Anaphylaxis** — laryngeal edema component; urticaria, hypotension, bronchospasm
- **Burns/inhalation injury** — singed nasal hairs, soot in oropharynx, hoarseness, history of fire/smoke exposure
- **Tumor** — gradual onset, progressive

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Assess patency | Immediate |
| Definitive airway if complete obstruction | < 3 minutes |
| Surgical airway if unable to intubate | < 5 minutes |

1. **Complete obstruction — conscious patient:**
   - Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) for foreign body
   - Chest thrusts for obese or pregnant patients
   - Back blows alternating with chest thrusts (infants)
2. **Complete obstruction — unconscious patient:**
   - Begin CPR, look in mouth for visible foreign body before each ventilation attempt
   - Direct laryngoscopy for visualization and removal with Magill forceps
3. **Partial obstruction:**
   - Allow patient to maintain position of comfort — DO NOT lay supine (may worsen)
   - Supplemental humidified O2
   - Prepare for definitive airway — have surgical airway equipment at bedside
4. **Angioedema (histamine-mediated/anaphylaxis):**
   - Epinephrine 0.3-0.5 mg IM (1:1000) — repeat q5-15min
   - Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, famotidine 20 mg IV
   - Dexamethasone 10 mg IV
   - Nebulized racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% in 3 mL NS
5. **Angioedema (ACE inhibitor / hereditary):**
   - Epinephrine, antihistamines, and steroids are INEFFECTIVE for bradykinin-mediated angioedema
   - Icatibant 30 mg SC (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist)
   - C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate (Berinert) 20 units/kg IV
   - Fresh frozen plasma 2-4 units if above unavailable
   - Prepare for intubation — may progress despite treatment
6. **Epiglottitis:**
   - Keep patient upright and calm — DO NOT examine throat if cooperative pediatric patient (may cause complete obstruction)
   - Controlled intubation in OR if available (ENT/anesthesia standby)
   - Emergent surgical airway if unable to intubate
   - Ceftriaxone 2 g IV + dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg IV (max 10 mg)
7. **Ludwig angina:**
   - Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h or clindamycin 600 mg IV q8h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV
   - Early intubation (awake fiberoptic preferred — anatomy distorted)
   - Surgical drainage by ENT/OMFS
8. **Surgical airway (cricothyrotomy)** — when unable to intubate or ventilate: vertical skin incision, horizontal stab through cricothyroid membrane, insert 6.0 cuffed tracheostomy or ETT

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Asthma/COPD exacerbation** — expiratory wheezing (lower airway), not stridor
- **Vocal cord dysfunction/paradoxical vocal fold motion** — inspiratory stridor mimicking asthma; responds to coached breathing, not bronchodilators
- **Croup (in children)** — barking cough, inspiratory stridor, typically age 6 months-3 years
- **Laryngospasm** — post-extubation or inhalation injury; sudden complete obstruction, resolves with positive pressure or succinylcholine
- **Tracheal stenosis** — history of prolonged intubation; progressive dyspnea and stridor

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — do NOT delay airway management for imaging
- **Flexible nasopharyngoscopy:** Direct visualization of supraglottic/glottic structures — gold standard for diagnosis but only if patient stable
- **Lateral neck X-ray:** Thumbprint sign (swollen epiglottis), retropharyngeal widening (> 7 mm at C2, > 22 mm at C6)
- **CT neck with contrast:** Retropharyngeal abscess, Ludwig angina, peritonsillar abscess — obtain only if airway is secure or patient is stable
- **Labs:** CBC, blood cultures (epiglottitis, deep space infection), tryptase (anaphylaxis), C4/C1 esterase inhibitor levels (if HAE suspected — send but do not wait)
- **CXR:** Post-foreign body removal, pneumomediastinum, subglottic narrowing

## Treatment

See Critical Actions for etiology-specific treatments above.

### Foreign Body
- Magill forceps under direct laryngoscopy
- Rigid bronchoscopy (for distal impaction — ENT/pulmonology)
- Surgical airway if unable to ventilate around obstruction

### Peritonsillar Abscess
- Needle aspiration (18G, lateral to midline at site of maximal fluctuance) — diagnostic and therapeutic
- OR incision and drainage
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg PO BID or clindamycin 300 mg PO QID x 10 days
- IV antibiotics if severe: ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV (reduces pain, speeds recovery)

### Retropharyngeal Abscess
- Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h or clindamycin 600 mg IV q8h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV
- Surgical drainage (ENT) — most require operative drainage
- Secure airway early — risk of rupture and aspiration

## Disposition

- **ICU/airway monitoring:** All patients with active or threatened airway compromise
- **Observation (minimum 6-8 hours):** Angioedema after treatment (risk of biphasic reaction), post-foreign body removal
- **ENT/OMFS consultation:** Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, Ludwig angina, epiglottitis
- **Discharge:** Resolved foreign body obstruction with normal post-removal exam and CXR; mild angioedema fully resolved after observation
- **Allergy/immunology referral:** ACE inhibitor angioedema, suspected HAE, recurrent angioedema

## Pitfalls

1. **Examining the oropharynx of a child with suspected epiglottitis.** Tongue depressor use or placing the child supine can convert partial obstruction to complete obstruction. Keep the child upright, calm, and on a parent's lap. Definitive airway management should occur in the OR with ENT backup.

2. **Treating ACE inhibitor angioedema with epinephrine and steroids alone.** ACE inhibitor angioedema is bradykinin-mediated, not histamine-mediated. Epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids have minimal effect. Icatibant, C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate, or FFP are the appropriate treatments. Always prepare for intubation — progression can be unpredictable.

3. **Delaying surgical airway when unable to intubate.** The "can't intubate, can't oxygenate" scenario requires immediate cricothyrotomy. Repeated intubation attempts in upper airway obstruction cause edema, bleeding, and worsening obstruction. If the first 1-2 attempts fail, proceed to surgical airway.

4. **Assuming angioedema will respond to single-dose epinephrine.** Angioedema may progress despite initial treatment. Patients must be observed for a minimum of 6-8 hours. ACE inhibitor angioedema in particular can progress for 24-48 hours. Premature discharge is dangerous.

5. **Missing retropharyngeal abscess in an adult with neck stiffness and dysphagia.** Retropharyngeal abscess in adults is uncommon but can be rapidly fatal if it ruptures into the airway. CT neck with contrast is diagnostic. Neck stiffness + dysphagia + fever in an adult should prompt imaging, especially with recent dental infection or pharyngitis.
