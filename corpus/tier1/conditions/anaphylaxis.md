# Anaphylaxis

## Recognition

**Definition (WAO/NIAID Criteria):** Anaphylaxis is highly likely when ANY ONE of the following is met:

1. Acute onset (minutes to hours) of skin/mucosal involvement (hives, angioedema, pruritus, flushing) AND at least one of:
   - Respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheeze, stridor, hypoxia)
   - Hypotension or end-organ dysfunction (syncope, incontinence, altered mental status)

2. Two or more of the following rapidly after exposure to a *likely* allergen:
   - Skin/mucosal involvement
   - Respiratory compromise
   - Hypotension or end-organ dysfunction
   - Persistent GI symptoms (vomiting, cramping, diarrhea)

3. Hypotension after exposure to a *known* allergen for that patient:
   - Adults: SBP < 90 mmHg or > 30% decrease from baseline
   - Infants/children: age-specific low SBP or > 30% decrease

**Key Exam Findings:**
- Skin (90%): urticaria, erythema, angioedema, pruritus
- Respiratory (70%): stridor, wheeze, hoarseness, dyspnea, cough
- Cardiovascular (45%): tachycardia, hypotension, syncope, dizziness
- GI (45%): nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea
- Neurologic: anxiety, sense of impending doom, altered mental status

**Common Triggers:**
- Medications (antibiotics, NSAIDs, neuromuscular blockers)
- Foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, egg)
- Insect stings (Hymenoptera)
- Latex
- Idiopathic (10-20%)

**Anaphylaxis WITHOUT skin findings occurs in 10-20% of cases.** Do not rule out anaphylaxis solely due to absent urticaria.

## Critical Actions

1. **Epinephrine IM** — 0.3-0.5 mg (1:1,000 = 1 mg/mL) in the anterolateral thigh. Repeat q5-15min as needed. NO MAXIMUM DOSE. This is the first, second, and third drug of choice.
   - Pediatric: 0.01 mg/kg IM (max 0.3 mg per dose)
2. **Remove trigger** — stop infusion, remove stinger, stop procedure.
3. **Position** — supine with legs elevated. If vomiting/dyspneic, recovery position or sitting. Do NOT make the patient sit up or stand (risk of "empty ventricle" sudden death).
4. **High-flow O2** — 15 L/min via non-rebreather.
5. **IV access** — 2 large-bore IVs. NS bolus 1-2 L for hypotension (20 mL/kg pediatric).
6. **Epinephrine infusion** — for refractory anaphylaxis: 1 mg in 250 mL NS (4 mcg/mL), start at 0.1 mcg/kg/min, titrate to effect.
7. **Airway management** — early intubation if stridor, voice change, tongue swelling. Airway edema progresses rapidly. Have surgical airway equipment at bedside.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Angioedema (hereditary/ACE-I) | Swelling without urticaria, no hypotension initially, no pruritus, bradykinin-mediated (epinephrine less effective) |
| Vasovagal syncope | Bradycardia (not tachycardia), pallor, no urticaria/wheeze, rapid recovery supine |
| Asthma exacerbation | Wheeze without skin findings, no hypotension, no allergen exposure |
| Carcinoid syndrome | Flushing, diarrhea, chronic course, elevated 5-HIAA |
| Mastocytosis/mast cell activation | Recurrent episodes, elevated baseline tryptase |
| Scombroid fish poisoning | Minutes after eating dark-meat fish, histamine-mediated, responds to antihistamines |
| Panic attack | Tachycardia/dyspnea without hypotension, urticaria, or wheeze |
| Septic shock | Fever, infectious source, no urticaria |

## Workup

**Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis. Do not delay epinephrine for labs or imaging.**

**Labs (drawn after treatment initiated):**
- Serum tryptase — draw within 1-2 hours of symptom onset (peaks at 60-90 min). Elevated > 11.4 ng/mL supports mast cell degranulation. Normal tryptase does NOT exclude anaphylaxis (especially food-triggered). Draw a second level at 24 hours for baseline comparison.
- CBC — eosinophilia possible, hemoconcentration from capillary leak
- BMP — monitor potassium (epinephrine causes hypokalemia)
- ABG/VBG — if respiratory distress
- Lactate — if hypotension/shock

**Imaging:** Generally not needed. CXR if persistent wheeze or concern for alternative diagnosis. Laryngoscopy if persistent stridor post-treatment.

## Treatment

**First-Line — Epinephrine:**
- Adults: 0.3-0.5 mg IM (1 mg/mL) anterolateral thigh, q5-15min PRN
- Pediatric: 0.01 mg/kg IM (max 0.3 mg), q5-15min PRN
- Refractory: epinephrine infusion 0.1-1 mcg/kg/min IV

**Second-Line Adjuncts (NONE of these replace epinephrine):**
- Albuterol 2.5-5 mg nebulized for bronchospasm (does not treat hypotension or angioedema)
- Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV (H1 blocker) — comfort measure for urticaria/pruritus, does NOT treat airway or hemodynamic compromise
- Famotidine 20 mg IV (H2 blocker) — adjunct, limited evidence
- Methylprednisolone 125 mg IV or dexamethasone 10 mg IV — theoretical prevention of biphasic reaction; onset 4-6 hours, no benefit in acute phase

**Refractory Anaphylaxis (not responding to 2-3 doses IM epinephrine):**
- Epinephrine infusion (see above)
- Vasopressin 1-2 units IV bolus, then 0.01-0.04 units/min infusion
- Glucagon 1-5 mg IV over 5 min for patients on beta-blockers (bypasses beta-receptor blockade, may cause vomiting — position to protect airway)
- Methylene blue 1-2 mg/kg IV over 20 min for vasoplegia refractory to catecholamines

**Airway Management:**
- Nebulized epinephrine (racemic 2.25% 0.5 mL or L-epinephrine 3-5 mL of 1 mg/mL) for stridor
- Early intubation — use the largest ETT possible; airway swelling progresses
- Video laryngoscopy preferred (edematous anatomy)
- Surgical airway (cricothyrotomy) equipment immediately available

**Beta-Blocker Patients:**
- May have refractory hypotension and paradoxical bradycardia
- Glucagon 1-5 mg IV
- Higher doses/more frequent epinephrine
- Consider vasopressin early

## Disposition

**Observation (minimum 4-6 hours post-last epinephrine dose):**
- Biphasic reactions occur in 1-20% (most within 8 hours)
- Higher risk of biphasic reaction: severe initial presentation, required multiple epinephrine doses, delayed epinephrine administration, unknown trigger

**Admit (ICU or monitored bed):**
- Required epinephrine infusion
- Refractory hypotension
- Required intubation or surgical airway
- Severe reaction with comorbidities (cardiac disease, asthma, beta-blocker use)
- Multiple epinephrine doses needed

**Discharge Criteria:**
- Symptom-free for at least 4 hours (6-8 hours for severe reactions)
- Prescribe epinephrine autoinjector (EpiPen 0.3 mg adult, 0.15 mg pediatric) — prescribe 2 devices
- Provide written anaphylaxis action plan
- Refer to allergist/immunologist within 4-6 weeks
- Educate on trigger avoidance
- Prescribe oral antihistamines and short course of prednisone 40-60 mg daily x 3-5 days (biphasic prophylaxis, limited evidence)

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying or withholding epinephrine.** Antihistamines and steroids are not first-line. Epinephrine delay is the single strongest predictor of mortality in anaphylaxis. Every minute without epinephrine increases risk of death.

2. **IV epinephrine bolus in a non-arrest patient.** IV push epinephrine (1 mg 1:10,000) in a patient with a pulse causes arrhythmias and hypertensive crisis. Use IM epinephrine (1:1,000) or an IV infusion (4 mcg/mL titrated). Reserve IV push for cardiac arrest.

3. **Excluding anaphylaxis because "there's no rash."** 10-20% of anaphylaxis presents without skin findings. Acute bronchospasm + hypotension after an exposure is anaphylaxis until proven otherwise.

4. **Making the patient sit up or stand.** Upright positioning in anaphylaxis causes cardiovascular collapse from "empty ventricle syndrome." Fatalities reported within minutes of sitting/standing. Keep supine with legs elevated unless vomiting or in respiratory distress.

5. **Discharging without an epinephrine autoinjector.** Biphasic reactions occur after leaving the ED. Patients without autoinjectors who have a recurrence in the community may die before reaching care. Prescribe at least 2 devices.

6. **Relying on steroids to prevent biphasic reaction.** Evidence for steroids preventing biphasic anaphylaxis is weak. Steroids should never replace observation, appropriate disposition, and discharge with autoinjectors.

7. **Forgetting glucagon in beta-blocked patients.** Beta-blockers blunt the effect of epinephrine. If a patient on a beta-blocker is not responding to repeated IM epinephrine, give glucagon 1-5 mg IV and consider vasopressin.
