# Open Fracture

## Recognition

**Definition:** Fracture with disruption of overlying skin and soft tissue creating communication between the fracture site and the external environment. Any wound in proximity to a fracture should be assumed to communicate with the fracture until proven otherwise.

**Gustilo-Anderson Classification:**

| Type | Wound Size | Soft Tissue | Contamination | Fracture Pattern | Infection Rate |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| I | < 1 cm | Minimal damage | Clean | Simple, low energy | 0-2% |
| II | 1-10 cm | Moderate damage, no flap | Moderate | Moderate comminution | 2-10% |
| IIIA | > 10 cm | Severe damage, adequate soft tissue coverage possible | Severe | High energy, comminuted | 10-25% |
| IIIB | > 10 cm | Massive soft tissue loss, requires flap coverage | Severe | Periosteal stripping | 25-50% |
| IIIC | Any | Arterial injury requiring repair | Any | Associated vascular injury | 25-50% |

**Clinical Assessment:**
- Visible bone or joint surface through wound
- Wound in proximity to known fracture (even small puncture wounds)
- Fat globules in wound drainage
- Deformity with overlying laceration or puncture
- High-energy mechanism (MVC, fall from height, blast, gunshot)

**Frequently Missed:**
- Small puncture wounds near fractures (nail, tooth)
- Wounds on opposite side of limb from fracture (inside-out mechanism — bone spike penetrates skin, retracts)
- Open fractures in obtunded/intubated polytrauma patients

## Critical Actions

1. **Control hemorrhage** — direct pressure, tourniquet for life-threatening extremity hemorrhage. Address hemorrhagic shock before fracture management.
2. **Photograph the wound** — document before dressing. Minimizes repeated wound exposure and contamination from serial exams.
3. **Remove gross contamination** — remove visible debris (dirt, clothing, grass). Irrigate with normal saline.
4. **Cover with saline-moistened sterile dressing** — do NOT pack the wound. Do NOT repeatedly expose the wound for serial exams.
5. **Antibiotics within 1 hour of injury:**
   - Type I/II: cefazolin 2 g IV (weight-based: 3 g if > 120 kg)
   - Type III: cefazolin 2 g IV + gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV
   - Farm/soil contamination: add high-dose penicillin G 4 million units IV (or metronidazole 500 mg IV for penicillin allergy) for Clostridium coverage
   - PCN/cephalosporin allergy: clindamycin 900 mg IV + gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV
6. **Tetanus prophylaxis** — Tdap if last dose > 5 years ago. TIG 250 units IM if vaccination history unknown or < 3 doses.
7. **Splint the extremity** — reduce fracture with traction if neurovascularly compromised. Reduce contamination, stabilize for transport, reduce pain.
8. **Emergent orthopedic consultation** — for operative irrigation, debridement, and fixation.
9. **Neurovascular exam** — document distal pulses, capillary refill, sensation, and motor function before and after any manipulation.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Closed fracture with adjacent laceration | No communication between wound and fracture on exploration; saline load test (inject sterile saline into joint/fracture, observe for extravasation through wound) if uncertain |
| Pathologic fracture through tumor | Minimal trauma mechanism, lytic lesion on X-ray, no external wound |
| Degloving injury without fracture | Skin avulsion/separation from underlying fascia, but X-ray shows no fracture |
| Laceration with underlying tendon/ligament injury | Wound near joint without fracture on imaging |
| Vascular injury without fracture | Pulsatile bleeding, expanding hematoma, diminished distal pulses; but X-ray shows no fracture |
| Osteomyelitis with draining sinus | Chronic wound overlying bone, chronic course, sequestrum on imaging |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- X-ray (AP and lateral) of affected extremity — first-line. Include joints above and below fracture.
- CT — for complex intra-articular fractures, periarticular fractures, or surgical planning
- CT angiography — if vascular injury suspected (diminished pulses, expanding hematoma, ABI < 0.9, Gustilo IIIC)
- Full trauma imaging (FAST, CT head/C-spine/chest/abdomen/pelvis) per ATLS protocols if polytrauma

**Labs:**
- Type and screen (Type and crossmatch if significant hemorrhage)
- CBC, BMP, coagulation studies
- Lactate — hemorrhagic shock assessment
- Pre-operative labs: CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, urinalysis

**Bedside:**
- Ankle-brachial index (ABI) — < 0.9 warrants CT angiography
- Saline load test — if uncertain whether wound communicates with fracture/joint: inject sterile saline into the joint under sterile conditions and observe for extravasation through wound. Volume varies by joint (knee: 155 mL sensitivity threshold).

## Treatment

**Emergency Department Management:**

*Wound Care:*
- Remove gross contamination (manual debris removal)
- Irrigate with NS — low-pressure lavage (gravity or bulb syringe) for Type I/II. High-pressure pulsatile lavage no longer recommended (drives bacteria deeper, damages tissue per FLOW trial).
- Volume: 3 L (Type I), 6 L (Type II), 9 L (Type III) — rule of thumb
- Saline is the irrigant of choice — bacitracin, betadine, and soap additives show no benefit and potential harm (FLOW trial)
- Cover with saline-moistened sterile gauze and wrap; minimize wound exposure

*Antibiotics:*
- Type I/II: cefazolin 2 g IV q8h
- Type III: cefazolin 2 g IV q8h + gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV q24h (or tobramycin)
- Soil/farm contamination: add penicillin G 4 million units IV q4h (Clostridium)
- Continue antibiotics 24 hours after wound closure for Type I/II, 72 hours or until soft tissue closure for Type III
- Fluoroquinolones (formerly used as alternative gram-negative coverage): associated with worse outcomes in open fractures, avoid

*Fracture Management:*
- Reduce and splint — restore alignment, reduce contamination exposure
- Reduce vascular compromise — immediate reduction if limb is pulseless or neurovascularly compromised
- Traction splint (Hare, Sager) for femoral shaft fractures

*Tetanus Prophylaxis:*
- Tdap if last booster > 5 years
- TIG 250 units IM if < 3 prior doses or unknown history

**Operative Management (orthopedics):**
- Irrigation and debridement (I&D) in OR — ideally within 6 hours for Type III, within 24 hours for Type I/II (recent evidence suggests time to antibiotics is more critical than time to OR for infection prevention)
- Definitive fixation: external fixation (damage control for Type III), intramedullary nail, plate/screw fixation
- Soft tissue coverage: primary closure (Type I), delayed closure, local muscle flap, free flap (Type IIIB)
- Gustilo IIIC: vascular repair +/- fasciotomy; temporary vascular shunt if hemodynamically unstable

## Disposition

**All open fractures require operative management.**

**OR Timing:**
- Gustilo IIIC (vascular injury): emergent OR for vascular repair
- Gustilo IIIA/IIIB: urgent OR (within 6-12 hours)
- Gustilo I/II: semi-urgent OR (within 24 hours if antibiotics given promptly)
- Time to antibiotics matters more than time to OR (Lack et al., 2015)

**Admission:**
- All open fractures — surgical ward or ICU depending on polytrauma severity
- Gustilo III: likely ICU for polytrauma, multiple operations
- Postoperative IV antibiotics per protocol

**Transfer:**
- If orthopedic surgery unavailable: splint, start antibiotics, cover wound, transfer emergently
- Gustilo IIIB/IIIC: transfer to Level I trauma center with plastic surgery/microsurgery and vascular surgery if not available locally

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying antibiotics.** Antibiotic administration within 1 hour of injury is the single most important intervention to prevent infection. Do not wait for orthopedic consultation, imaging, or OR availability. Time to antibiotics is more impactful than time to OR debridement.

2. **Missing a small open fracture wound.** A 3mm puncture wound near a tibial fracture is an open fracture. Any wound near a fracture is open until proven otherwise. Examine the entire circumference of the limb. Document wounds on the opposite side of the limb from the fracture (inside-out mechanism).

3. **Repeatedly exposing the wound for serial exams.** Photograph the wound once and cover it. Each exposure introduces additional contamination. Serial wound inspections by multiple providers worsen outcomes.

4. **Omitting gram-negative coverage for Gustilo Type III.** Type III open fractures have high rates of gram-negative infection. Cefazolin alone is insufficient — add gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV.

5. **Using fluoroquinolones for gram-negative coverage.** Ciprofloxacin/levofloxacin have been associated with higher infection rates and impaired fracture healing in open fractures compared to aminoglycosides. Gentamicin is the preferred agent.

6. **Forgetting tetanus prophylaxis.** Open fractures are tetanus-prone wounds. Check vaccination status and administer Tdap +/- TIG. This is missed frequently in the rush of trauma resuscitation.

7. **Failing to assess for compartment syndrome.** High-energy open fractures (especially tibial) are at risk for concurrent compartment syndrome. An open fracture does not decompress the compartment — fascial compartments may still be intact with elevated pressures.

8. **Not performing a thorough neurovascular exam before and after manipulation.** Document distal pulses, sensation, and motor function prior to reduction. Post-reduction neurovascular compromise requires immediate intervention. Medicolegal documentation is critical.

9. **High-pressure wound irrigation.** The FLOW trial (2015) demonstrated that high-pressure pulsatile lavage is not superior to low-pressure irrigation and may drive contaminants deeper into tissue. Use gravity flow or bulb syringe irrigation with normal saline.
