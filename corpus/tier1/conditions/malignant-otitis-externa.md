# Malignant (Necrotizing) Otitis Externa

## Recognition

**Definition:** Malignant otitis externa (MOE) is an aggressive, invasive infection of the external auditory canal that spreads to the temporal bone and skull base, causing osteomyelitis, cranial nerve palsies, and intracranial complications. Despite the name, it is infectious — not neoplastic. The organism is Pseudomonas aeruginosa in > 95% of cases.

**Host Factors (nearly all patients have ≥ 1):**
- Diabetes mellitus (> 90% of cases) — microangiopathy of ear canal + immunocompromise
- Immunosuppression (HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy, transplant recipients)
- Advanced age

**Clinical Features:**

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Severe otalgia** | Disproportionate to exam findings; worse at night; progressive over weeks |
| **Otorrhea** | Persistent purulent drainage unresponsive to topical antibiotics |
| **Granulation tissue** | At the osseocartilaginous junction of the ear canal floor — pathognomonic when present in a diabetic patient |
| **Edematous ear canal** | Diffuse swelling; may mimic simple OE initially |
| **Cranial nerve palsies** | CN VII (facial palsy) most common (earliest CN involved); CN IX, X, XI, XII as disease spreads along skull base |
| **Trismus** | TMJ involvement from temporal bone extension |
| **Headache** | Deep, temporal/occipital; suggests skull base involvement |

**Progression Pattern:**
1. External canal infection (weeks) → fails topical therapy
2. Temporal bone osteomyelitis → granulation tissue at canal floor
3. Skull base osteomyelitis → cranial nerve palsies (VII first, then IX-XII)
4. Intracranial extension → meningitis, brain abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, death

**Key Distinguishing Feature from Simple OE:**
- Simple OE responds to topical antibiotics within 7-10 days
- MOE fails topical therapy and progresses despite treatment
- Deep, boring pain out of proportion to visible external canal findings
- Granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction is the hallmark

## Critical Actions

1. **High clinical suspicion in any diabetic or immunocompromised patient with OE that fails 2 weeks of topical therapy.** Do not attribute persistent ear pain and drainage to treatment-resistant simple OE. Escalate workup for skull base osteomyelitis.

2. **CT temporal bone with contrast.** Identifies soft tissue in ear canal, bone erosion of the temporal bone/skull base, extension to surrounding structures. CT is the initial imaging modality for anatomic delineation.

3. **MRI brain and skull base with gadolinium.** Superior for evaluating soft tissue extension, dural enhancement, intracranial complications, and cranial nerve involvement. MRI is more sensitive than CT for early skull base osteomyelitis.

4. **Technetium-99m bone scan or Gallium-67 scan.** Tc-99m bone scan detects osteomyelitis with high sensitivity (but remains positive even after disease resolution — not useful for monitoring treatment response). Gallium-67 scan normalizes with treatment resolution — used to guide duration of antibiotic therapy.

5. **Culture ear canal drainage (not a swab — deep aspiration or biopsy).** Pseudomonas aeruginosa in > 95%. MRSA and fungi (Aspergillus) are emerging pathogens, especially in patients with prior antibiotic courses. Biopsy granulation tissue to exclude malignancy (squamous cell carcinoma of the ear canal mimics MOE).

6. **IV antipseudomonal antibiotics.** Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q8h (or 750 mg PO BID if not systemically ill) as initial therapy. If ciprofloxacin-resistant or severe disease: cefepime 2 g IV q8h or piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h or meropenem 1 g IV q8h. Duration: 6-8 weeks minimum, guided by Gallium scan normalization.

7. **ENT consultation for tissue biopsy, aural toilet, and ongoing care.** Biopsy of granulation tissue is mandatory to exclude squamous cell carcinoma.

8. **Optimize diabetes management.** Strict glycemic control (target glucose < 180 mg/dL) improves treatment response. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil function and perpetuates infection.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Simple otitis externa** | Responds to topical therapy within 7-10 days; no granulation tissue at osseocartilaginous junction; no bone erosion on imaging; no cranial nerve involvement |
| **Squamous cell carcinoma of ear canal** | Overlapping presentation; biopsy is mandatory; carcinoma shows malignant squamous cells on histology, not inflammatory granulation |
| **Cholesteatoma** | Pearly white mass in middle ear; conductive hearing loss; CT shows middle ear soft tissue with bone erosion of scutum |
| **Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus)** | Vesicular eruption on auricle and ear canal; CN VII palsy; CN VIII involvement (hearing loss, vertigo); no granulation tissue |
| **Wegener granulomatosis (GPA)** | Ear involvement with nasal crusting, saddle nose, pulmonary nodules; ANCA-positive; granulomatous inflammation on biopsy |
| **Temporal bone osteomyelitis (non-Pseudomonal)** | Same presentation; culture distinguishes organism; fungal (Aspergillus) increasingly common in immunocompromised |
| **Otitis media with complications** | Middle ear origin (not external canal); may develop mastoiditis, intracranial extension; TM bulging or perforation; air-fluid level in middle ear |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- CT temporal bone with contrast: bone erosion, soft tissue extent, mastoid involvement
- MRI brain + skull base with gadolinium: soft tissue invasion, dural enhancement, intracranial extension, cranial nerve enhancement
- Tc-99m bone scan: confirms osteomyelitis (high sensitivity); stays positive after cure — not useful for treatment monitoring
- Gallium-67 scan: normalizes with disease resolution — used to determine when to stop antibiotics

**Laboratory:**
- CBC with differential
- BMP (glucose, creatinine)
- ESR and CRP (elevated; useful for treatment monitoring — trending)
- HbA1c (quantify diabetes control)
- Blood cultures (if systemically septic)

**Microbiology:**
- Deep ear canal culture (aspiration, not swab)
- Granulation tissue biopsy: culture AND histopathology (exclude SCC)
- Fungal culture (Aspergillus if immunosuppressed or failed antipseudomonal therapy)

**Cranial Nerve Assessment:**
- Full cranial nerve examination (CN II-XII)
- Audiometry (sensorineural hearing loss from CN VIII involvement)
- Facial nerve electroneurography if CN VII palsy present (prognostic)

## Treatment

**Antipseudomonal Antibiotics (6-8 weeks minimum):**
- First-line: Ciprofloxacin 750 mg PO BID (outpatient for mild disease) or ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q8h (inpatient for moderate-severe)
- Ciprofloxacin-resistant or severe: cefepime 2 g IV q8h, OR piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h, OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h
- Dual therapy for severe disease: cefepime 2 g IV q8h + ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q8h
- Fungal MOE (Aspergillus): voriconazole 6 mg/kg IV q12h x2 doses, then 4 mg/kg IV q12h, transition to 200 mg PO BID

**Duration Guidance:**
- Minimum 6 weeks IV/oral antipseudomonal therapy
- Continue until Gallium-67 scan normalizes (may take 3-6 months)
- Premature discontinuation → relapse (recurrence rate 15-20%)
- ESR/CRP trending guides clinical response but is insufficient alone to determine cure

**Local Care:**
- Aural toilet (debridement of granulation tissue and debris) by ENT
- Topical ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone otic drops as adjunct to systemic therapy
- Keep ear canal dry; avoid water exposure

**Surgical Intervention (limited role):**
- Extensive debridement rarely indicated — MOE is primarily a medical disease
- Surgery for: abscess drainage, failed medical therapy, tissue biopsy
- Facial nerve decompression for progressive CN VII palsy (controversial)

**Diabetes Optimization:**
- Strict glycemic control (target glucose < 180 mg/dL, HbA1c < 8%)
- Endocrinology consultation for refractory hyperglycemia
- Consider insulin adjustment during active infection

## Disposition

**Admit for:**
- Cranial nerve palsies (CN VII or lower CNs)
- Intracranial extension (meningitis, brain abscess, sinus thrombosis)
- Systemic sepsis
- Need for IV antibiotics (severe disease or unable to tolerate oral)

**Outpatient management (with ENT follow-up) for:**
- Early disease without cranial nerve involvement
- Able to tolerate oral ciprofloxacin
- Reliable follow-up (weekly ENT visits)
- Well-controlled diabetes

**ENT follow-up schedule:** Weekly for first month, then biweekly until Gallium scan normalizes.

**Transfer if:** No ENT service available; intracranial complications requiring neurosurgery.

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating persistent otitis externa in a diabetic patient with repeated courses of topical antibiotics without escalating workup.** Simple OE resolves within 7-10 days with topical therapy. Any diabetic or immunocompromised patient with ear pain and otorrhea persisting beyond 2 weeks of appropriate topical therapy must be evaluated for MOE. Delayed diagnosis allows progression from external canal infection to skull base osteomyelitis.

2. **Missing granulation tissue at the osseocartilaginous junction.** The pathognomonic finding of MOE is granulation tissue at the junction of the cartilaginous and bony ear canal (inferior canal wall). This requires adequate otoscopic visualization — cerumen removal and sometimes aural toilet by ENT. A cursory otoscopic exam through a swollen, debris-filled canal will miss this finding.

3. **Failing to biopsy granulation tissue to exclude squamous cell carcinoma.** SCC of the ear canal presents identically to MOE: ear pain, drainage, granulation tissue, bone destruction on CT. The only way to differentiate is histopathologic examination. Every patient with suspected MOE must have a tissue biopsy before committing to 6+ weeks of antibiotics for a presumed infectious diagnosis.

4. **Stopping antibiotics based on symptom improvement alone.** MOE requires 6-8 weeks minimum of antipseudomonal antibiotics. Clinical improvement occurs well before eradication of skull base osteomyelitis. Premature discontinuation leads to relapse in 15-20% of cases. Gallium-67 scan normalization — not symptom resolution — determines treatment endpoint.

5. **Prescribing aminoglycoside otic drops (neomycin-containing) in suspected MOE.** Aminoglycoside otic drops are ototoxic if the tympanic membrane is perforated (which it often is in advanced MOE). Use fluoroquinolone otic drops (ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone) as topical adjunct instead.
