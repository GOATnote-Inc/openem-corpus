# Ludwig's Angina

## Recognition

**Definition:** Rapidly progressive, bilateral, gangrenous cellulitis of the submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces. Polymicrobial (oral anaerobes + aerobes). Not a discrete abscess in early stages — diffuse woody induration.

**Clinical features:**
- Bilateral submandibular swelling with "woody" brawny induration (not fluctuant)
- Floor of mouth elevation — tongue displaced posterosuperiorly
- Trismus (inability to open mouth)
- Drooling, dysphagia, odynophagia
- Muffled "hot potato" voice
- Stridor, respiratory distress (late = impending airway loss)
- Fever, toxic appearance
- Submandibular erythema and tenderness

**Risk factors:**
- Dental infection (most common source: mandibular molar infection, 70-90%)
- Immunocompromised states (HIV, chemotherapy)
- Diabetes mellitus
- IV drug use
- Recent dental procedures or mandibular fracture
- Peritonsillar abscess extension

**Microbiology:** Polymicrobial — Streptococcus viridans group, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, Fusobacterium. MRSA increasingly reported.

**Airway assessment (perform immediately):**
- Can the patient speak in full sentences?
- Is there stridor at rest?
- Can the patient swallow secretions?
- Degree of trismus (mouth opening < 3 cm = severe)
- Degree of floor of mouth elevation and tongue protrusion

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Airway assessment and management | Immediate — within minutes of arrival |
| IV antibiotics | < 30 minutes from presentation |
| ENT/OMFS consultation | Immediate at time of diagnosis |
| CT neck with contrast | After airway secured |

1. **Airway first.** Ludwig's kills by airway obstruction. Secure the airway before any other intervention if signs of compromise (stridor, inability to swallow secretions, progressive swelling, oxygen desaturation)
2. **Awake fiberoptic intubation** is the preferred airway approach — allows visualization of distorted anatomy with spontaneous ventilation preserved
3. **Surgical airway (cricothyrotomy)** if fiberoptic intubation fails or is unavailable. Tracheostomy by ENT/OMFS if time permits. **Do NOT attempt blind nasotracheal intubation** — distorted anatomy makes passage unpredictable and risks hemorrhage and complete airway loss
4. **RSI only if surgical airway backup is immediately ready** — paralysis eliminates the patient's ability to maintain their own airway and may convert a difficult airway to a cannot-intubate/cannot-oxygenate scenario
5. **IV antibiotics:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h (first-line); alternative: clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h. Add vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose if MRSA risk
6. **Dexamethasone 10 mg IV** to reduce airway edema (give immediately; repeat q8h for 48 hours)
7. **Emergent ENT/OMFS consultation** for surgical drainage — incision and drainage of involved spaces

## Differential Diagnosis

- Peritonsillar abscess (unilateral, uvular deviation, trismus — limited to peritonsillar space)
- Parapharyngeal abscess (lateral neck swelling, medial displacement of tonsil/lateral pharyngeal wall)
- Retropharyngeal abscess (posterior pharyngeal swelling, neck stiffness, dysphagia — prevertebral space)
- Angioedema (allergic or ACE-inhibitor; no fever, no dental source, responds to epinephrine/antihistamines)
- Submandibular salivary gland abscess (unilateral, over Wharton's duct)
- Epiglottitis (supraglottic, no submandibular swelling, "thumbprint" sign on lateral neck X-ray)
- Oral/pharyngeal malignancy (subacute, weight loss, unilateral)

## Workup

- **Airway assessment takes priority over all imaging and labs**
- **CT neck with IV contrast:** Gold standard for delineating extent of infection, identifying drainable abscess collections, assessing airway patency. Obtain only after airway is secured or if no immediate airway compromise
- **CT findings:** Enhancement and stridor in submandibular/sublingual/submental spaces, gas within soft tissues (gas-forming organisms), abscess formation, airway narrowing
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis with left shift
- **BMP:** Glucose (undiagnosed diabetes), renal function (for drug dosing)
- **Blood cultures x2** before antibiotics
- **Lactate** if sepsis suspected
- **Wound/aspiration cultures** if surgical drainage performed — send aerobic and anaerobic cultures
- **Lateral neck X-ray:** May show soft tissue swelling, gas, airway narrowing; inferior to CT
- **Panoramic dental X-ray:** Identify dental source after stabilization

## Treatment

### Airway Management (Priority 1)
- **Awake fiberoptic intubation:** Preferred approach. Topical lidocaine 4% nebulized + atomized to oropharynx/larynx. Sedation with ketamine 0.5-1 mg/kg IV (preserves respiratory drive) or dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg IV over 10 min
- **Surgical airway (cricothyrotomy):** Immediate if fiberoptic fails or unavailable. Vertical skin incision, identify cricothyroid membrane, horizontal stab with #20 scalpel, insert 6.0 cuffed tracheostomy or ETT
- **Tracheostomy** by ENT/OMFS under local anesthesia if time allows and expertise available
- Do NOT attempt blind nasal intubation
- Have double surgical airway setup at bedside before any intubation attempt

### Antibiotic Therapy
- **First-line:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h (covers oral aerobes and anaerobes)
- **Penicillin-allergic:** Clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h
- **MRSA concern:** Add vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose (then 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h, target AUC/MIC 400-600)
- Duration: 2-3 weeks IV, transition to PO when improving clinically

### Adjunctive Therapy
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q8h x 48 hours (reduces edema, may avoid intubation in early cases)
- IV fluid resuscitation: NS or LR 20-30 mL/kg bolus for sepsis
- Analgesia: Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q4h PRN or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV q1h PRN
- Insulin sliding scale or infusion for hyperglycemia (diabetes is common comorbidity)

### Surgical Drainage
- ENT/OMFS performs incision and drainage of submandibular, sublingual, and submental spaces
- Bilateral submental and submandibular incisions with blunt dissection
- Drain placement for continued drainage
- Dental extraction of causative tooth (may be performed simultaneously or after acute phase)

## Disposition

- **All Ludwig's angina patients:** ICU admission with continuous airway monitoring
- **Intubated patients:** Remain intubated until swelling resolves (typically 48-72 hours); assess with cuff-leak test before extubation
- **Patients not intubated:** ICU observation with surgical airway equipment at bedside, frequent airway reassessment q1-2h, keep NPO
- **Post-surgical drainage:** Continue IV antibiotics, monitor drain output, serial CT if not improving within 48 hours
- **Transfer:** If ENT/OMFS and anesthesiology with fiberoptic intubation capability not available, transfer immediately with most experienced airway provider accompanying patient

## Pitfalls

1. **Attempting RSI without surgical airway backup.** Paralysis eliminates the patient's ability to maintain their own airway. If intubation fails after paralysis, the patient is in a cannot-intubate/cannot-oxygenate crisis. Always have cricothyrotomy setup open and ready before any intubation attempt.

2. **Sending the patient to CT before securing the airway.** Airway obstruction can progress in minutes. A patient who decompensates in the CT scanner is in the worst possible location for emergent surgical airway. Secure the airway first, image second.

3. **Waiting for imaging to start antibiotics.** IV antibiotics should be administered within 30 minutes. Delayed antibiotic therapy allows continued spread through fascial planes to the mediastinum (descending necrotizing mediastinitis, mortality >40%).

4. **Expecting a drainable abscess in early Ludwig's angina.** Early Ludwig's is diffuse gangrenous cellulitis, not a localized abscess. CT may show phlegmon without drainable collection. Antibiotics and airway management are the initial priorities; surgical drainage is performed when collections form.

5. **Failing to screen for diabetes.** Up to 40% of Ludwig's angina patients have undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Check point-of-care glucose immediately. Hyperglycemia worsens infection outcomes and impairs wound healing.

6. **Discharging a patient with "mild" submandibular swelling.** Ludwig's angina progresses rapidly over hours. Bilateral floor-of-mouth induration is Ludwig's until proven otherwise and requires admission regardless of initial airway status.

7. **Administering sedation that abolishes respiratory drive.** Benzodiazepines and opioids in high doses can eliminate the patient's compensatory airway positioning. If sedation is needed, use ketamine (preserves airway reflexes and respiratory drive).

8. **Failing to consult ENT/OMFS early.** Surgical drainage reduces infection burden and prevents spread to mediastinum. Early consultation allows OR preparation in parallel with medical stabilization.

9. **Missing descending necrotizing mediastinitis.** Ludwig's angina spreads along the deep cervical fascia into the mediastinum. Chest pain, worsening sepsis despite adequate antibiotics, or CT showing mediastinal gas/fluid requires emergent thoracic surgery consultation.
