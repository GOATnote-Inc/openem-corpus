# High-Pressure Injection Injury

## Recognition

**Mechanism:**
- Industrial high-pressure devices (grease guns, paint sprayers, hydraulic systems, diesel fuel injectors) discharge material at 2,000-10,000+ PSI
- Material enters through a small puncture wound (typically index finger, non-dominant hand)
- Injected material travels along fascial planes and tendon sheaths
- Index finger most common (40%); thumb, long finger also affected

**Deceptive presentation:**
- **Small, benign-appearing puncture wound** — the external wound dramatically underrepresents the extent of internal injury
- Mild initial pain that worsens over hours
- Minimal swelling initially; progressive swelling and ischemic changes over 2-6 hours
- Decreased sensation, pallor, or dusky discoloration of the digit

**Material determines prognosis:**
- **Paint/paint thinner/solvents:** worst prognosis — chemical inflammation + tissue necrosis; amputation rate 30-60%
- **Grease/oil:** moderate prognosis — less chemical irritation; amputation rate 15-20%
- **Water/air:** best prognosis — less tissue destruction; amputation rate < 5%

**Key principle:** The external wound does NOT reflect the severity of internal injury. This injury is a surgical emergency regardless of initial appearance.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Recognize the mechanism | At triage |
| X-ray of affected area | Immediately (shows subcutaneous air/material spread) |
| Hand surgery consultation | EMERGENT |
| Surgical decompression | < 6 hours from injury |
| Pain control | Immediately |

1. **Identify the injected material** — ask the patient or contact the workplace to determine the substance, pressure, and device
2. **X-ray of the affected hand/digit** — shows radiopaque material tracking along fascial planes and air in soft tissues; determines extent of spread
3. **Emergent hand surgery consultation** — this is a surgical emergency requiring wide debridement within 6 hours
4. **Do NOT perform digital block** — increases compartment pressure in an already compromised digit
5. **Tetanus prophylaxis**
6. **IV antibiotics** — contaminated wound
7. **Elevate the hand** at level of the heart (not above — preserve perfusion)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Simple puncture wound (no high-pressure mechanism — but always ask about industrial tools)
- Nail gun injury (discrete foreign body, lower-pressure)
- Flexor tenosynovitis (Kanavel signs — but different mechanism)
- Compartment syndrome of the hand (may coexist)
- Cellulitis (diffuse erythema, but different time course and no puncture wound history)
- Bite wound (animal or human)
- Foreign body retention (standard low-velocity)

## Workup

- **X-ray of hand (AP, lateral, oblique):** demonstrates subcutaneous air, radiopaque material tracking along tissue planes and tendon sheaths; defines proximal extent of spread
- **Document the injected substance** — contact employer, obtain MSDS/SDS (Safety Data Sheet) for the specific product
- **Neurovascular exam:** document capillary refill, two-point discrimination, Allen test, and active flexion/extension of each digit
- **CBC, BMP:** baseline pre-operative labs
- **No CT or MRI required urgently** — plain films and clinical exam are sufficient; do not delay surgery for advanced imaging

## Treatment

### Emergent Surgical Decompression (DEFINITIVE)
- **Wide surgical debridement and decompression within 6 hours** — standard of care
- Open the digit/hand along Bruner zigzag incisions or mid-axial approach
- Irrigate extensively to remove injected material
- **Do NOT close primarily** — leave wounds open for delayed primary closure or healing by secondary intention
- Repeat washout and debridement at 24-48 hours is common

### Pre-Operative ED Management
- **Elevate the hand** at heart level
- **Do NOT perform digital nerve block** — adds volume to an already compromised compartment; increases ischemic pressure
- **Regional block (wrist block or brachial plexus block) is acceptable** — does not increase compartment pressure
- **IV analgesia:** morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q15min PRN or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV q15min PRN
- **IV antibiotics:** cefazolin 2 g IV (cover skin flora; polymicrobial contamination from industrial material)
- ADD **metronidazole 500 mg IV** if anaerobic contamination suspected (oil/grease)
- **Tetanus prophylaxis** per guidelines
- **Splint the hand** in position of safety (wrist 20-30 degrees extension, MCPs 70-90 degrees flexion, IPs in extension)

### Post-Operative
- Serial debridements every 24-48 hours until wound bed is clean
- Delayed primary closure or skin grafting once infection risk has passed
- **Hand therapy referral** — early mobilization to prevent stiffness
- Amputation may be necessary for devitalized digits despite debridement

## Disposition

- **ALL high-pressure injection injuries:** Admission for emergent surgical decompression
- **Surgery within 6 hours** — delay beyond 10 hours dramatically increases amputation rate
- **Transfer:** if no hand surgery available, splint, elevate, give IV antibiotics, and transfer immediately
- **Post-operative:** admission for serial debridements, IV antibiotics, pain management

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing the injury as a "simple puncture wound."** The small entry wound belies the extensive deep tissue destruction. A high-pressure injection injury requires emergent surgical decompression regardless of the benign external appearance. Every patient must be asked about the mechanism of injury (industrial equipment).

2. **Performing a digital nerve block.** Injecting local anesthetic into an already compromised digital compartment increases pressure and worsens ischemia. Use a wrist block or IV/IM analgesia instead.

3. **Delaying surgery because the hand "doesn't look that bad."** The injected material continues to cause chemical necrosis and inflammatory destruction for hours. Amputation rates increase significantly with each hour of delay beyond 6 hours.

4. **Not identifying the injected substance.** Paint thinners and organic solvents cause severe chemical tissue necrosis with amputation rates of 30-60%, while water or air injuries have much better prognoses. The substance determines the aggressiveness of debridement and the prognosis.

5. **Elevating the hand above the heart.** Excessive elevation can reduce arterial perfusion to an already ischemic digit. Elevate at the level of the heart to reduce edema without compromising inflow.
