# Bacterial Meningitis

## Recognition

**Classic Triad:** Fever, neck stiffness, altered mental status. Present in only 44% of cases. At least 2 of 4 (headache, fever, neck stiffness, AMS) are present in 95%.

**Presentation:**
- Headache (87%)
- Fever (77%)
- Neck stiffness/meningismus (83%)
- Altered mental status (69%)
- Nausea/vomiting
- Photophobia
- Seizures (20-30%)
- Petechial/purpuric rash (strongly suggests N. meningitidis — but present in only 50% of meningococcal cases)
- Focal neurologic deficits (10-20%)

**Physical Exam Signs:**
- Kernig sign: resistance/pain with knee extension when hip flexed 90 degrees (sensitivity 5%, specificity 95%)
- Brudzinski sign: involuntary hip flexion when neck is passively flexed (sensitivity 5%, specificity 95%)
- Jolt accentuation: headache worsened by horizontal head rotation 2-3 times per second (sensitivity 97% for CSF pleocytosis in febrile patients)
- Papilledema (if present, raises concern for elevated ICP — perform CT before LP)

**Causative Organisms by Age:**

| Age Group | Most Common Pathogens |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Neonates (< 1 month) | Group B Streptococcus, E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes |
| Infants/children (1 mo - 18 yr) | N. meningitidis, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae (unvaccinated) |
| Adults (18-50 yr) | S. pneumoniae (most common), N. meningitidis |
| Adults > 50 yr | S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, Listeria monocytogenes |
| Immunocompromised | Listeria, gram-negatives, S. pneumoniae, Cryptococcus |
| Post-neurosurgical/VP shunt | S. aureus, coagulase-neg Staphylococci, gram-negatives |

## Critical Actions

1. **Empiric antibiotics IMMEDIATELY** — do NOT wait for CT or LP if either will be delayed. Door-to-antibiotic time < 1 hour. Every hour of delay increases mortality.
2. **Dexamethasone BEFORE or WITH first antibiotic dose** — 0.15 mg/kg IV q6h x 4 days (adult: 10 mg IV q6h). Must be given before or concurrent with antibiotics. No benefit if given after antibiotics.
3. **Blood cultures x2** — draw before antibiotics if possible without delaying antibiotics. LP can follow.
4. **Lumbar puncture** — when safe (see CT indications below). Opening pressure, CSF glucose, protein, cell count with differential, Gram stain, culture, meningitis PCR panel.
5. **CT head ONLY if indicated** — do not delay antibiotics for CT. Indications for CT before LP: immunocompromised, history of CNS disease, new-onset seizure, papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, GCS < 10.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Viral meningitis | Less toxic-appearing, CSF lymphocytic predominance, normal glucose, lower protein |
| Subarachnoid hemorrhage | Thunderclap headache, no fever (usually), CT/LP with xanthochromia and RBCs |
| Encephalitis (HSV/viral) | Prominent AMS, personality change, temporal lobe on MRI, CSF lymphocytic |
| Brain abscess | Focal deficits, ring-enhancing lesion on CT, insidious onset |
| Fungal/TB meningitis | Subacute onset (weeks), basilar meningitis, CSF lymphocytic, low glucose |
| Meningeal carcinomatosis | Subacute, cranial neuropathies, malignant cells in CSF |
| Drug-induced meningitis | NSAIDs, IVIG, TMP-SMX, intrathecal agents; temporal correlation with drug exposure |

## Workup

**CT Head Before LP — Required if ANY of the following:**
- Immunocompromised (HIV, transplant, immunosuppressive drugs)
- History of CNS lesion (mass, stroke, abscess)
- New-onset seizure (within 1 week)
- Papilledema
- Focal neurologic deficit
- GCS < 10

If CT is needed, give empiric antibiotics + dexamethasone BEFORE CT scan.

**Lumbar Puncture — CSF Interpretation:**

| Parameter | Bacterial | Viral | TB/Fungal |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Opening pressure | > 30 cmH2O (elevated) | Normal-mild elevation | Elevated |
| WBC | > 1000 (PMN predominant) | 10-500 (lymphocyte predominant) | 50-500 (lymphocyte predominant) |
| Glucose | < 40 mg/dL or CSF:serum < 0.4 | Normal | Low |
| Protein | > 200 mg/dL | 50-100 mg/dL | > 100 mg/dL |
| Gram stain | Positive 60-90% | Negative | AFB rarely positive |

**Additional CSF Studies:**
- Meningitis/encephalitis multiplex PCR panel (FilmArray — results in ~1 hour)
- Latex agglutination (if Gram stain negative)
- CSF lactate > 35 mg/dL (sensitivity 93%, specificity 96% for bacterial meningitis)

**Labs:**
- Blood cultures x2 (positive in 50-75%)
- CBC with differential
- BMP (Na — SIADH occurs in 30%)
- Coagulation studies
- Procalcitonin (elevated > 0.5 ng/mL strongly supports bacterial etiology)
- Lactate
- CRP

## Treatment

**Empiric Antibiotics (give within 1 hour of presentation):**

| Patient Group | Empiric Regimen |
|---------------|----------------|
| Adults 18-50 yr | Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h |
| Adults > 50 yr | Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h + ampicillin 2g IV q4h (Listeria coverage) |
| Immunocompromised | Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h + ampicillin 2g IV q4h |
| Neonates | Ampicillin 300 mg/kg/day divided q6h + cefotaxime 200 mg/kg/day divided q6h (or gentamicin) |
| Post-neurosurgical/VP shunt | Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h + cefepime 2g IV q8h (or meropenem 2g IV q8h) |
| Penicillin allergy (severe) | Meropenem 2g IV q8h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h |

**Vancomycin dosing target:** AUC/MIC 400-600 (consult pharmacy). Load with 25-30 mg/kg if severe sepsis.

**Dexamethasone:**
- Adults: 0.15 mg/kg (typically 10 mg) IV q6h x 4 days
- Give BEFORE or WITH first antibiotic dose
- Greatest benefit in S. pneumoniae meningitis (reduces mortality from 34% to 14%, reduces hearing loss)
- Discontinue if non-pneumococcal etiology confirmed (conflicting evidence for other organisms)
- Pediatric: 0.15 mg/kg IV q6h x 4 days for H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae

**Pathogen-Directed Therapy (after culture and sensitivity):**

| Organism | Preferred | Duration |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| S. pneumoniae (PCN-sensitive) | Penicillin G 4 million units IV q4h | 10-14 days |
| S. pneumoniae (PCN-resistant) | Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h +/- vancomycin | 10-14 days |
| N. meningitidis | Penicillin G 4 million units IV q4h or ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h | 7 days |
| Listeria | Ampicillin 2g IV q4h (+/- gentamicin) | 21 days |
| Group B Strep | Penicillin G or ampicillin | 14-21 days |
| H. influenzae | Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h | 7 days |

**Seizure Management:**
- Levetiracetam 1000-1500 mg IV load, then 500-1000 mg IV q12h
- Prophylactic anticonvulsants NOT routinely recommended

**Elevated ICP Management:**
- Head of bed 30 degrees
- Mannitol 1 g/kg IV or hypertonic saline 23.4% 30 mL via central line
- Hyperventilation (target pCO2 30-35 mmHg) as bridge to definitive therapy

## Disposition

**ICU Admission:**
- GCS < 10
- Septic shock/hemodynamic instability
- Seizures
- Focal neurologic deficits
- DIC/purpura fulminans
- Respiratory failure

**Floor/Stepdown:**
- GCS 14-15 after initial treatment
- Hemodynamically stable
- No seizures, no focal deficits

**Chemoprophylaxis for Close Contacts (N. meningitidis only):**
- Rifampin 600 mg PO q12h x 2 days (adults) or 10 mg/kg q12h x 2 days (children)
- Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO x 1 dose (adults, preferred for simplicity)
- Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM x 1 dose (preferred in pregnancy)
- Administer within 24 hours of index case identification
- Notify public health department immediately for N. meningitidis cases

**Reportable Disease:** Bacterial meningitis (especially N. meningitidis and H. influenzae) is reportable in all US states.

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying antibiotics for CT or LP.** Every hour of antibiotic delay increases mortality significantly. If CT is needed, give antibiotics and dexamethasone FIRST, then scan, then LP. The LP can wait; the antibiotics cannot.

2. **Omitting dexamethasone or giving it AFTER antibiotics.** Dexamethasone reduces mortality and hearing loss in pneumococcal meningitis. Benefit is lost if given after antibiotics are already started. The steroid must be on board when bacterial lysis begins.

3. **Forgetting Listeria coverage in patients > 50, pregnant, or immunocompromised.** Ceftriaxone does NOT cover Listeria. Add ampicillin 2g IV q4h. Missing Listeria meningitis is fatal.

4. **Ruling out meningitis based on absence of the classic triad.** The full triad (fever, neck stiffness, AMS) is present in fewer than half of cases. A febrile patient with headache and any altered mentation should raise concern for meningitis.

5. **Normal CT does not exclude elevated ICP.** A normal CT does not guarantee a safe LP. Clinical signs (papilledema, focal deficits, severely depressed GCS) take priority. If strong clinical concern for herniation exists despite normal CT, proceed cautiously or defer LP.

6. **Dismissing a partially treated LP as "non-diagnostic."** Oral antibiotics before arrival alter CSF findings (lower WBC, negative cultures) but do not eliminate disease. Use PCR panels, CSF lactate, and procalcitonin to support the diagnosis.

7. **Failing to notify public health for meningococcal disease.** N. meningitidis requires urgent chemoprophylaxis of close contacts. Delay puts household contacts, dormitory residents, and healthcare workers at risk. Report immediately and initiate prophylaxis within 24 hours.
