# Umbilical Cord Prolapse

## Recognition

**Definition:** Descent of the umbilical cord through the cervix alongside (occult) or past (overt) the fetal presenting part after rupture of membranes. Cord compression between the presenting part and the pelvis/cervix causes fetal hypoxia and death within minutes.

**Types:**
- **Overt cord prolapse:** Cord visible at introitus or palpable in vaginal canal below the presenting part
- **Occult cord prolapse:** Cord alongside the presenting part, not past it; diagnosed by fetal heart rate abnormalities

**Clinical findings:**
- Visible loop of umbilical cord at the introitus
- Palpable pulsating cord on vaginal examination
- Fetal heart rate abnormalities: prolonged bradycardia (<110 bpm), severe variable decelerations, sinusoidal pattern
- Often occurs immediately after spontaneous or artificial rupture of membranes
- Sudden fetal distress after amniotomy

**Risk factors:**
- Malpresentation (transverse lie, breech, oblique)
- Polyhydramnios
- Premature rupture of membranes with unengaged presenting part
- Preterm labor
- Multiple gestation (especially second twin after delivery of first)
- Amniotomy with high presenting part
- Long umbilical cord
- Multiparity
- Low-lying placenta

**Fetal heart rate monitoring:**
- Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is essential
- Bradycardia < 110 bpm lasting > 3 minutes = emergent intervention
- Variable decelerations with slow return to baseline
- Terminal bradycardia without recovery

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Manual elevation of presenting part | Immediately upon diagnosis |
| Call OB and OR team | Simultaneously with manual elevation |
| Emergent cesarean delivery | Decision-to-delivery < 10 minutes |

1. **Call for help immediately.** Activate obstetric emergency, call OB, anesthesia, NICU, OR team — simultaneously
2. **Manual elevation of the presenting part:** Insert gloved hand into the vagina and push the fetal presenting part upward, off the compressed cord. Maintain continuous upward pressure until cesarean delivery. Do NOT remove your hand
3. **Position the patient:** Knee-chest position (most effective) or steep Trendelenburg (head down) — uses gravity to shift the presenting part off the cord
4. **Bladder filling:** Insert Foley catheter and fill the bladder with 500-700 mL warm normal saline via syringe to mechanically elevate the presenting part off the cord. Clamp the catheter. This is a temporizing measure that frees the examiner's hand
5. **Do NOT attempt to replace the cord** back above the presenting part — manipulation causes vasospasm and worsens fetal compromise
6. **Tocolysis:** Terbutaline 0.25 mg SC to reduce uterine contractions and relieve intermittent cord compression. Alternatives: nitroglycerin 50-200 mcg IV bolus for uterine relaxation
7. **Emergent cesarean section** — definitive treatment. Target decision-to-delivery interval < 10 minutes
8. **Keep the cord warm and moist** if visible outside the introitus — wrap in warm saline-soaked gauze. Do NOT handle excessively (vasospasm risk)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Placental abruption (vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, tonic uterine contraction, fetal distress — no palpable cord)
- Uterine rupture (sudden abdominal pain, loss of uterine contour, fetal bradycardia, previous cesarean scar)
- Vasa previa with rupture (painless vaginal bleeding at amniotomy, fetal tachycardia then bradycardia — fetal blood vessels crossing cervical os)
- Fetal bradycardia from other causes (maternal hypotension, epidural-related, uteroplacental insufficiency)
- Nuchal cord (cord around fetal neck; typically identified at delivery, not prolapsing through cervix)
- Normal umbilical cord presentation (cord palpable at cervix with intact membranes and no distress — warrants monitoring but not emergent delivery)

## Workup

- **Sterile vaginal examination:** Definitive diagnosis — palpable pulsating cord in the vaginal canal or visible at introitus. Assess cervical dilation simultaneously
- **Continuous electronic fetal monitoring:** Fetal heart rate pattern confirms ongoing cord compression
- **Fetal viability assessment:** Confirm gestational age > 23-24 weeks (threshold for intervention); palpate cord for pulsation; verify fetal heart activity on bedside ultrasound if unsure
- **Bedside ultrasound:** Confirm fetal cardiac activity, fetal presentation, cord position (if diagnosis uncertain)
- **Maternal labs (draw during preparation for cesarean):** CBC, type and crossmatch, BMP, coagulation studies
- **Do NOT delay intervention for imaging or labs** — cord prolapse is a clinical diagnosis requiring immediate action

## Treatment

### Immediate Interventions (Simultaneous)
- **Manual elevation:** Gloved hand in vagina, push presenting part upward off cord continuously
- **Knee-chest position** or steep Trendelenburg
- **Bladder filling:** Foley catheter, 500-700 mL warm NS via syringe, clamp catheter (release bladder before cesarean incision)
- **Tocolysis:** Terbutaline 0.25 mg SC (onset 3-5 min). Alternative: nitroglycerin 50-200 mcg IV (onset 1-2 min, shorter duration)
- **Keep cord warm and moist:** Wrap exposed cord in warm saline-soaked gauze. Minimize handling

### Emergent Cesarean Delivery
- Definitive treatment for overt cord prolapse
- General anesthesia if regional not already in place (fastest induction-to-delivery)
- Decision-to-delivery interval < 10 minutes is the target
- NICU team present at delivery for neonatal resuscitation
- Release bladder Foley before uterine incision

### If Fully Dilated and Presenting Part Low
- Emergent operative vaginal delivery (vacuum or forceps) may be faster than cesarean if conditions are met: vertex presentation, fully dilated, +2 station or below, experienced operator
- This is operator-dependent; cesarean remains default

### Neonatal Resuscitation
- NICU team present at delivery
- Prepare for depressed neonate: warmer, suction, positive-pressure ventilation, intubation equipment, epinephrine
- Delayed cord clamping is NOT appropriate in cord prolapse with fetal distress — clamp and cut immediately to allow resuscitation

### If Fetus is Previable or Confirmed Fetal Demise
- Emergent cesarean is not indicated
- Expectant management; allow vaginal delivery
- Confirm fetal death with bedside ultrasound before changing plan

## Disposition

- **Mother post-cesarean:** Postpartum recovery unit, then postpartum floor. Standard post-cesarean monitoring (vitals q15min x 1 hour, then q30min x 2 hours)
- **Neonate:** NICU admission for monitoring (cord gas analysis, neurologic assessment, Apgar scoring)
- **Cord blood gas analysis:** Obtain arterial and venous cord gases immediately at delivery (assess degree of fetal acidosis)
- **Debrief:** Obstetric team debrief; event documentation for quality assurance
- **If diagnosed in community/transport setting:** Maintain manual elevation and knee-chest positioning during transport; call ahead to receiving facility for immediate OR preparation

## Pitfalls

1. **Removing the hand from the vagina before cesarean delivery.** Once you begin manual elevation of the presenting part, do NOT remove your hand until the surgeon has delivered the fetus. Releasing pressure allows cord re-compression and fetal death.

2. **Attempting to replace the cord above the presenting part.** Pushing the cord back causes vasospasm of the umbilical vessels, worsening fetal ischemia. The cord should be left in place and kept warm and moist.

3. **Delaying cesarean delivery for imaging or labs.** Cord prolapse is a clinical diagnosis made on vaginal examination. Every minute of delay increases the risk of fetal neurologic injury and death. Decision-to-delivery must be < 10 minutes.

4. **Failing to fill the bladder as a temporizing measure.** Bladder filling with 500-700 mL saline mechanically elevates the presenting part and frees the examiner's hand. This is a critical bridge maneuver, especially if the OR is not immediately ready or during transport.

5. **Not placing the patient in knee-chest or Trendelenburg position.** Gravity assists in lifting the presenting part off the cord. Supine positioning allows continued compression. Knee-chest is most effective.

6. **Performing amniotomy with a high, unengaged presenting part.** Cord prolapse risk is highest when the presenting part is not well-applied to the cervix. Amniotomy in this setting should be performed cautiously with preparations for emergent delivery.

7. **Failing to assess fetal viability before performing emergent cesarean.** Palpate the cord for pulsation and confirm fetal cardiac activity on bedside ultrasound. Emergent cesarean for a confirmed fetal demise subjects the mother to unnecessary surgical risk.

8. **Not having tocolytics immediately available in labor and delivery.** Terbutaline 0.25 mg SC or nitroglycerin IV should be stocked in every delivery suite. Uterine contractions intermittently compress the cord even with manual elevation.

9. **Forgetting to drain the bladder before cesarean incision.** If bladder filling was performed as a temporizing measure, the distended bladder must be drained before the surgeon makes the uterine incision to avoid bladder injury.
