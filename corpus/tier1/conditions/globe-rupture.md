# Globe Rupture (Open Globe Injury)

## Recognition

**Definition:** Full-thickness wound of the eye wall (cornea or sclera). Classified by Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology (BETT) system:
- **Rupture:** full-thickness wound from blunt trauma (globe bursts at weakest point — usually limbus or prior surgical site)
- **Penetrating injury:** single full-thickness wound from sharp object (entry wound only)
- **Perforating injury:** two full-thickness wounds (entry AND exit — through-and-through)
- **Intraocular foreign body (IOFB):** retained foreign material within the globe

**Mechanism:**
- Blunt trauma: fist, ball, airbag deployment, fall. Globe ruptures at weakest points: limbus (junction of cornea and sclera), insertion sites of extraocular muscles, sites of prior surgery (cataract incision, radial keratotomy scars)
- Penetrating/perforating: knife, nail, glass, wire, projectile, BB gun, hammering metal-on-metal (high IOFB risk)
- Blast injury: combination mechanism

**Signs (physical exam — handle the eye GENTLY):**
- **Irregular or peaked pupil** (teardrop-shaped, pointing toward wound)
- **Hyphema** (blood in anterior chamber)
- **Shallow or flat anterior chamber** (aqueous humor leaking)
- **Extrusion of uveal tissue** (dark brown/pigmented tissue visible at wound — iris, ciliary body, or choroid)
- **Positive Seidel test:** fluorescein instilled on cornea, streaming aqueous dilutes fluorescein at wound site (green stream from wound under cobalt blue light)
- **360-degree subconjunctival hemorrhage** (obscures scleral wound beneath)
- **Reduced visual acuity** (ranges from mildly decreased to no light perception)
- **Vitreous hemorrhage** (absent red reflex)
- **Decreased intraocular pressure** (soft globe on gentle palpation — do NOT measure IOP formally)
- **Lens dislocation or cataract** (visible white opacity, lens displaced)
- **Enophthalmos** (eye recessed in socket from volume loss)

**Occult Open Globe:** Small scleral ruptures under intact conjunctiva may have minimal external signs. High-velocity injuries (BB gun, projectile) can cause small self-sealing entry wounds. Maintain high suspicion with any high-velocity mechanism and reduced vision.

## Critical Actions

1. **Protect the eye with a rigid shield immediately.** Use a Fox shield or rigid eye shield taped to the brow and cheekbone (NOT the globe). Do NOT use an eye patch — pressure on an open globe extrudes intraocular contents.
2. **Do NOT check intraocular pressure (tonometry).** Any pressure applied to the globe can cause further extrusion of intraocular contents.
3. **Do NOT apply pressure to the globe** — no patching, no forceful lid retraction, no direct pressure to stop bleeding.
4. **Do NOT remove penetrating foreign bodies.** Foreign objects protruding from the globe act as tamponade. Stabilize them in place. Removal occurs in the OR under controlled conditions.
5. **Do NOT instill topical medications** except antibiotics (moxifloxacin 0.5% 1 drop if available and wound allows safe instillation). Avoid drops that could be toxic to intraocular structures if they enter through the wound.
6. **Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees** to reduce intraocular pressure and minimize extrusion risk.
7. **Antiemetics prophylactically:** ondansetron 4 mg IV. Vomiting and Valsalva increase IOP and can extrude intraocular contents through the wound.
8. **Adequate analgesia:** morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV. Pain causes crying, blepharospasm, and Valsalva — all increase IOP.
9. **Emergent ophthalmology consult for surgical repair.** Best outcomes with primary repair within 24 hours. Globe repair is an emergent OR case.
10. **CT orbit** to evaluate for IOFB and extent of injury.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Corneal abrasion | Superficial defect, positive fluorescein uptake but NO streaming (negative Seidel), normal anterior chamber depth, normal pupil, intact globe. |
| Hyphema (closed globe) | Blood in anterior chamber from blunt trauma, but: normal IOP or elevated, normal anterior chamber depth, no wound, intact globe on exam. |
| Orbital wall fracture (without globe rupture) | Periorbital edema/ecchymosis, restricted extraocular movements (entrapment), enophthalmos, infraorbital hypoesthesia. Globe intact on exam, normal anterior chamber. |
| Subconjunctival hemorrhage (benign) | Bright red, well-demarcated area under conjunctiva. No visual acuity change, normal pupil, normal IOP. No history of significant trauma. |
| Retrobulbar hemorrhage | Proptosis (NOT enophthalmos), elevated IOP, decreased vision, restricted EOM, tense orbit. Requires emergent lateral canthotomy. Globe intact but compressed. |
| Chemical eye injury | History of chemical exposure. Diffuse conjunctival injection and chemosis. pH abnormal on litmus testing. Copious irrigation is first priority. |
| Anterior uveitis | Photophobia, ciliary flush, cell/flare in anterior chamber. No wound, no hyphema, no pupil irregularity from trauma. |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- **CT orbit (thin cuts, 1 mm axial and coronal, NO contrast):** first-line imaging. Detects: metallic and glass intraocular foreign bodies (>95% sensitivity for metallic IOFB), globe deformity, retrobulbar hemorrhage, orbital fractures, lens dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage.
- **MRI is CONTRAINDICATED** if metallic foreign body is suspected (ferromagnetic IOFB will move in magnetic field, causing further intraocular destruction). All penetrating injuries and hammering/grinding mechanisms must have CT before MRI is ever considered.
- **Plain radiographs:** low sensitivity, largely replaced by CT. May be used if CT unavailable to screen for metallic IOFB.
- **Ultrasound (B-scan):** DO NOT perform through an open globe wound. May be performed by ophthalmology in the OR after wound closure.

**Laboratory:**
- CBC, BMP
- Coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT) — pre-operative
- Type and screen (for OR)
- Blood glucose

**Tetanus Status:**
- Td or Tdap if last booster >5 years ago
- Tetanus immune globulin (TIG) 250 units IM if immunization history unknown or incomplete

**Visual Acuity:**
- Document visual acuity in both eyes before any intervention (medicolegal importance). Use Snellen chart if possible; otherwise document counting fingers, hand motion, light perception, or no light perception. Formal VA provides baseline and prognostic value (presenting VA is the strongest predictor of visual outcome).

## Treatment

**Immediate ED Management:**
- Rigid eye shield (Fox shield) — secured with tape, not pressure
- Head of bed elevated 30 degrees
- NPO status (patient will need OR)
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV (antiemetic — prevent Valsalva)
- Analgesics: fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV or morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV
- Avoid medications that lower seizure threshold or cause vomiting

**Antibiotics (endophthalmitis prophylaxis):**
- **Systemic (start in ED):**
  - Levofloxacin 500 mg IV every 24 hours (covers gram-negatives and has excellent intraocular penetration)
  - OR: vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV every 8-12h (target AUC/MIC 400-600) + ceftazidime 1 g IV every 8 hours (broader coverage for high-risk wounds: soil contamination, rural setting, organic foreign body, delayed presentation)
- **Topical:** moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic 1 drop to affected eye (if wound permits safe instillation without pressure)
- Start antibiotics as early as possible — endophthalmitis risk increases with every hour of delay
- High-risk for endophthalmitis: rural setting, soil/organic contamination, lens capsule disruption, retained IOFB, delayed presentation >24 hours

**Tetanus Prophylaxis:**
- Td 0.5 mL IM if last booster >5 years ago
- TIG 250 units IM if vaccination status unknown/incomplete

**Surgical Management (ophthalmology — OR):**
- Primary surgical repair within 24 hours (optimal: within 12 hours)
- Wound closure, repositioning of prolapsed tissue, IOFB removal if accessible
- Vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, or IOFB removal
- Secondary procedures (lens removal, retinal detachment repair) often staged

**What NOT To Do:**
- Do NOT check IOP (tonometry)
- Do NOT apply pressure to the globe
- Do NOT use an eye patch
- Do NOT remove protruding foreign bodies
- Do NOT perform forced duction testing
- Do NOT instill topical anesthetics or mydriatics through the wound
- Do NOT obtain MRI if metallic foreign body suspected

## Disposition

**All open globe injuries require admission:**
- Ophthalmology admission for emergent or urgent surgical repair (within 24 hours)
- NPO in ED pending OR
- Pre-operative labs and anesthesia notification

**Transfer:**
- If no ophthalmology coverage: emergent transfer to facility with ophthalmologic surgical capability
- Place rigid eye shield, start IV antibiotics and antiemetics, elevate HOB before transfer
- Contact accepting ophthalmologist directly — these patients need OR access, not just clinic follow-up

**Post-operative:**
- Inpatient observation for 24-48 hours post-repair minimum
- IV antibiotics continued for 48-72 hours, then oral (levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO daily)
- Serial visual acuity checks
- Monitor for endophthalmitis (increasing pain, decreasing vision, hypopyon) — onset 2-7 days post-injury
- Ophthalmology follow-up within 1-2 days of discharge

## Pitfalls

1. **Checking IOP on a suspected open globe.** Tonometry applies direct pressure to the cornea. In an open globe, this forces intraocular contents out through the wound. If you suspect open globe, do NOT measure IOP. If IOP was inadvertently checked and is low, that finding itself supports the diagnosis.

2. **Applying a pressure patch instead of a rigid shield.** An eye patch applies pressure directly to the globe and causes extrusion of intraocular contents. A rigid shield (Fox shield or improvised with a cup) bridges from the brow to the cheekbone, creating a protective cage over the eye without contacting the globe.

3. **Removing a protruding foreign body in the ED.** Foreign objects lodged in the globe provide tamponade and prevent further extrusion of intraocular contents. Removal in the ED — without a controlled OR environment, vitrectomy capability, and microsurgical instruments — risks catastrophic vitreous and retinal loss. Stabilize the object in place and transport to OR.

4. **Missing an occult open globe.** Small scleral ruptures beneath intact conjunctiva or self-sealing corneal perforations from high-velocity projectiles (BB gun, metal fragments) can have subtle exam findings. Dense subconjunctival hemorrhage (360 degrees) after trauma, unexplained reduced VA, low IOP on palpation, or irregular pupil should prompt CT orbit and ophthalmology consultation.

5. **Obtaining MRI with a potential metallic IOFB.** MRI is absolutely contraindicated when a metallic intraocular foreign body is suspected. The magnetic field moves ferromagnetic objects within the globe, causing further tissue destruction. All patients with penetrating mechanism (especially hammering or grinding metal) must have CT orbit before any MRI is considered.

6. **Forgetting antiemetics.** Vomiting causes a dramatic increase in IOP via Valsalva. In an open globe, this can extrude vitreous, lens, and retina through the wound. Ondansetron 4 mg IV should be given prophylactically in the ED — do not wait for nausea.

7. **Delaying antibiotics.** Post-traumatic endophthalmitis is a devastating complication with rates of 3-7% in open globe injuries. Risk increases with each hour of delay. IV antibiotics (levofloxacin 500 mg IV or vancomycin + ceftazidime) should be started in the ED as soon as open globe is suspected, before CT, before ophthalmology arrives, before transfer.

8. **Not documenting visual acuity.** Presenting visual acuity is the single strongest predictor of final visual outcome in open globe injuries and is essential for medicolegal documentation. Record VA in both eyes before any intervention. Even "light perception" or "no light perception" is critical prognostic and legal information.

9. **Forcefully retracting lids to examine the eye.** Forceful lid retraction increases orbital pressure and can worsen extrusion of intraocular contents. Use a lid speculum gently or have the patient open voluntarily. If examination is too difficult or painful, defer detailed exam to ophthalmology in the OR under anesthesia.
