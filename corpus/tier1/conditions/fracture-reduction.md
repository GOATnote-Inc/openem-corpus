# Fracture and Dislocation Reduction

## Recognition

**Indications for Emergency Reduction:**
- Any dislocation with neurovascular compromise (absent distal pulse, paresthesias, pallor)
- Open fracture-dislocation (reduce, cover wound, antibiotics, surgery consultation)
- Fracture with vascular compromise or skin tenting
- Posterior hip dislocation (avascular necrosis risk increases significantly after 6 hours)
- Ankle fracture-dislocation with skin tenting or vascular compromise
- Any displaced fracture requiring alignment for splinting

**Joints Commonly Reduced in ED:**
- Shoulder (anterior dislocation — 95% of shoulder dislocations)
- Hip (posterior dislocation — 90% of hip dislocations)
- Elbow
- Patella (lateral dislocation)
- Finger/toe interphalangeal joints
- Ankle fracture-dislocation
- Knee dislocation (emergency — check for popliteal artery injury)

**Contraindications to Closed Reduction:**
- Associated fracture that makes closed reduction hazardous (femoral neck fracture with hip dislocation — orthopedic consultation)
- Suspected vascular injury requiring surgical exploration (knee dislocation with absent pulse)
- Open fracture requiring operative washout (reduce in ED as temporizing measure, then OR)
- > 3 failed reduction attempts — risk of iatrogenic injury; consult orthopedics for OR reduction

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Neurovascular exam | Before AND after reduction |
| Analgesia/sedation | Before reduction attempt |
| Postreduction imaging | Immediately after successful reduction |
| Immobilization | After confirmed reduction |

1. **Pre-reduction neurovascular exam** — document pulses, sensation, motor function
2. **Pre-reduction imaging** — X-ray to identify fracture pattern and direction of displacement (if no vascular compromise; if vascular compromise, reduce immediately)
3. **Analgesia/sedation** — procedural sedation, intra-articular injection, nerve block, or hematoma block
4. **Perform reduction** using appropriate technique
5. **Post-reduction neurovascular exam** — document changes from pre-reduction
6. **Post-reduction imaging** — confirm anatomic alignment, congruent joint
7. **Immobilize** — splint or sling in appropriate position
8. **Orthopedic follow-up** — arrange within 1-2 weeks for fractures, 1 week for dislocations

## Differential Diagnosis

**When Reduction is NOT the Appropriate Intervention:**

| Condition | Management |
|-----------|-----------|
| Pathologic fracture (tumor, osteoporosis) | Imaging, oncology consultation; gentle handling |
| Septic joint with apparent deformity | Arthrocentesis for diagnosis; orthopedic washout |
| Periarticular fracture mimicking dislocation | Imaging clarifies; may require OR fixation |
| Ligamentous laxity / subluxation without frank dislocation | Immobilization, follow-up |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- X-ray (2+ views) of the affected joint/bone
- Neurovascular exam: distal pulses (palpation + Doppler if weak), capillary refill, sensation (light touch, two-point discrimination), motor (intrinsic hand muscles for upper extremity, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion for lower)
- For knee dislocation: ABI (ankle-brachial index) mandatory — ABI < 0.9 requires CT angiography
- Assess for associated injuries (rotator cuff tear with shoulder dislocation, sciatic nerve palsy with posterior hip dislocation)

**Equipment:**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Procedural sedation supplies | See procedural-sedation entry |
| Hematoma block kit | 10 mL syringe, 18g needle, lidocaine 1% 10-20 mL |
| Intra-articular anesthesia | Lidocaine 1% 20 mL for shoulder |
| Splinting materials | Plaster or fiberglass, padding, elastic bandage |
| Sling | Shoulder immobilizer |
| Traction device | Finger traps (for distal radius), traction splint (femur) |

## Treatment

### Anterior Shoulder Dislocation

**External Rotation Method (first-line; can be done without sedation):**
1. Patient seated or supine; elbow flexed 90 degrees, arm adducted
2. Slowly externally rotate the arm — 1-2 degrees per second
3. At 70-110 degrees of external rotation, the humeral head reduces with a palpable clunk
4. Success rate: 78-90%
5. Advantage: minimal force, no sedation required in cooperative patients

**Cunningham Technique (massage-based):**
1. Patient seated upright, arm adducted, elbow flexed
2. Massage the biceps, deltoid, and trapezius to relax spasm
3. Patient shrugs shoulders while arm is gently externally rotated
4. Reduction occurs spontaneously once muscles relax

**Stimson Technique:**
1. Patient prone on stretcher with affected arm hanging off the edge
2. Attach 5-10 lb weight to wrist (or have patient hold)
3. Gravity provides traction; gentle external rotation assists
4. Wait 15-20 minutes for muscle relaxation

**Traction-Countertraction:**
1. Sheet wrapped around patient's chest for countertraction
2. Steady inline traction on the arm at 30-45 degrees of abduction
3. Assistant provides countertraction
4. External rotation + traction reduces the head into the glenoid

**Post-reduction:** sling and swathe; X-ray confirms concentric reduction; orthopedic follow-up in 1-2 weeks

### Posterior Hip Dislocation

**Requires procedural sedation — significant force needed**

**Allis Maneuver (standard):**
1. Patient supine; assistant stabilizes pelvis by pressing down on bilateral ASIS
2. Flex hip to 90 degrees
3. Apply steady longitudinal traction along the femoral shaft (pull toward ceiling with hip and knee flexed)
4. Gentle internal and external rotation while maintaining traction
5. Reduction = palpable clunk, leg returns to normal length and rotation

**Captain Morgan Technique:**
1. Patient supine; provider places their knee under the patient's flexed knee (on the stretcher)
2. Provider plantar flexes their own foot, using their shin as a fulcrum under the patient's knee
3. This applies upward force on the femur — reduces the hip
4. Advantage: less physical effort for the provider

**Time-critical:** reduce within 6 hours to minimize AVN risk of the femoral head

### Ankle Fracture-Dislocation

1. Procedural sedation or hematoma block (inject 10-15 mL lidocaine 1% into fracture site)
2. Grasp the heel (calcaneus) with one hand, forefoot with the other
3. Apply longitudinal traction (distraction)
4. Reverse the deformity: for lateral displacement, translate medially; for posterior displacement, translate anteriorly
5. Hold reduction, apply posterior splint with U-shaped stirrup
6. Confirm with X-ray; assess for skin viability and distal pulses

### Distal Radius Fracture (Colles)

1. Hematoma block: 5-10 mL lidocaine 1% injected into fracture hematoma using 18g needle
2. Finger traps for traction (10-15 minutes) or manual traction
3. Recreate the deformity (hyperextend), then apply traction + volar flexion + ulnar deviation
4. Apply sugar-tong or volar splint
5. Confirm alignment with X-ray

### Post-Procedure (All Reductions)
- Post-reduction neurovascular exam (document and compare to pre-reduction)
- Post-reduction X-ray
- Appropriate immobilization (splint, sling, traction splint)
- Pain management
- Orthopedic follow-up within 1-2 weeks

## Disposition

- **Successful reduction, neurovascularly intact:** discharge with splint/sling and orthopedic follow-up
- **Hip dislocation (successful reduction):** admission for observation; CT to evaluate for posterior wall acetabular fracture
- **Knee dislocation (any):** admission; vascular surgery consultation; CT angiography mandatory (popliteal artery injury in 20-40%)
- **Failed reduction (> 3 attempts):** orthopedic consultation for OR reduction under general anesthesia
- **Open fracture-dislocation:** reduce, cover wound with sterile saline-soaked dressing, IV antibiotics (cefazolin 2 g + gentamicin 5 mg/kg), tetanus, emergent orthopedic consultation for washout

## Pitfalls

1. **Not documenting neurovascular status before reduction.** Post-reduction neurovascular deficits may be attributed to the reduction if the pre-reduction exam was not documented. A new nerve palsy after reduction is a surgical emergency (nerve entrapment). Always document pulses, sensation, and motor function before AND after.

2. **Delaying hip dislocation reduction beyond 6 hours.** Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is directly correlated with time to reduction. Beyond 6 hours, AVN risk increases significantly (up to 50% at 12 hours). Hip dislocations are time-critical emergencies — reduce as soon as adequate sedation is achieved.

3. **Excessive force during reduction causing iatrogenic fracture.** Reduction should be performed with steady, controlled traction — not sudden jerking movements. If the joint does not reduce with reasonable force and adequate sedation/relaxation, stop after 3 attempts and consult orthopedics. Iatrogenic humeral neck fracture during shoulder reduction and femoral head fracture during hip reduction are preventable complications.

4. **Not obtaining post-reduction imaging.** A "clunk" felt during reduction does not guarantee anatomic alignment. Post-reduction X-ray (or CT for hip/knee) is mandatory to confirm congruent reduction and identify fracture fragments that may be trapped in the joint.

5. **Missing a knee dislocation that spontaneously reduced.** Knee dislocations may reduce spontaneously before the patient arrives. Any knee injury with multiligamentous instability requires CT angiography to rule out popliteal artery injury (40% incidence), regardless of pulse exam. ABI < 0.9 mandates CTA.

6. **Reducing an ankle fracture-dislocation without checking skin viability.** Displaced ankle fracture-dislocations cause skin tenting, which can progress to skin necrosis within hours. Reduction is urgent to relieve pressure on the skin, even before definitive imaging or orthopedic consultation.
