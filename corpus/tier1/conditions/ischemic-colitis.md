# Ischemic Colitis

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Sudden onset crampy abdominal pain (typically left-sided), followed by urgency to defecate
- Mild-to-moderate bloody diarrhea or hematochezia within 24 hours of pain onset
- Classically in elderly patients (> 60 years) with cardiovascular risk factors
- Pain is out of proportion to exam findings early; progresses if ischemia worsens

**Risk factors:**
- Atherosclerosis, hypotension/shock, atrial fibrillation
- Aortic surgery (0.5-10% post-AAA repair)
- Medications: vasoconstrictors, digitalis, NSAIDs, estrogens, cocaine, methamphetamine
- Hypercoagulable states, sickle cell disease
- Long-distance running (young patients)

**Anatomic distribution:**
- Watershed areas most vulnerable: splenic flexure (Griffiths point), rectosigmoid junction (Sudeck point)
- Right-sided ischemic colitis (ICA/SMA territory) — more severe, higher surgical rates, suggests acute mesenteric ischemia

**Exam findings:**
- Mild-moderate abdominal tenderness (usually left-sided)
- Hematochezia on rectal exam
- Peritoneal signs suggest transmural necrosis — emergent surgical evaluation

## Critical Actions

1. **Aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation** — optimize perfusion pressure, MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
2. **NPO, bowel rest**
3. **Avoid vasopressors if possible** — worsen mesenteric ischemia; optimize volume status first
4. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics for moderate-severe disease:** ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily PLUS metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
5. **Surgical consultation** for right-sided involvement, peritoneal signs, hemodynamic instability, or gangrenous colitis
6. **Discontinue causative medications** — vasoconstrictors, digoxin, NSAIDs, offending drugs
7. **Serial abdominal exams and lactate monitoring q4-6h**
8. **CT angiography** if isolated right colon or acute mesenteric ischemia suspected

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute mesenteric ischemia (arterial occlusion)** — more severe, diffuse pain out of proportion to exam, small bowel involvement, elevated lactate; CTA shows SMA occlusion
- **Infectious colitis** — fever, diarrhea, stool cultures positive (Salmonella, Shigella, C. difficile, E. coli O157:H7)
- **Inflammatory bowel disease flare** — chronic history, typically younger patients, endoscopic biopsy distinguishes
- **Diverticulitis** — localized LLQ pain with pericolonic fat stranding on CT, no hematochezia typically
- **Colorectal carcinoma** — chronic bleeding, weight loss, iron deficiency anemia

## Workup

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (preferred initial imaging):**
  - Bowel wall thickening (target sign), pericolonic fat stranding, thumbprinting
  - Segmental distribution in watershed areas
  - Pneumatosis or portal venous gas = transmural necrosis (emergent surgery)
- **CT angiography:** if right-sided ischemic colitis or acute mesenteric ischemia suspected
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, lactate (elevated = advanced ischemia), LDH, CPK, coagulation studies, type and screen
- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy (within 48 hours if stable):**
  - Edematous, hemorrhagic mucosa; submucosal hemorrhage; single-stripe sign
  - Do NOT perform if peritoneal signs or suspected gangrene
  - Minimal insufflation with CO2, avoid over-distension
- **Stool studies:** C. difficile, bacterial culture, ova and parasites
- **ECG:** assess for atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia as embolic source

## Treatment

**Mild disease (80% of cases — self-limited):**
- Bowel rest, IV fluids, electrolyte correction
- Antibiotics: ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h or ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily PLUS metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
- Serial clinical assessment q8-12h
- Gradual diet advancement when pain and bleeding resolve

**Moderate-severe disease:**
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h
- Blood transfusion for Hgb < 7 g/dL or hemodynamic instability
- Anticoagulation if embolic source identified (after surgical clearance)
- Avoid vasopressors that worsen mesenteric perfusion (use norepinephrine at lowest effective dose if required)

**Surgical indications (emergent):**
- Peritonitis
- Pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous gas
- Gangrenous colitis on CT or endoscopy
- Perforation (free intraperitoneal air)
- Massive hemorrhage unresponsive to resuscitation
- Clinical deterioration despite medical management
- Isolated right colon ischemia (high rate of full-thickness necrosis)
- Procedure: segmental colectomy or subtotal colectomy with end colostomy

## Disposition

- **Admit all patients with suspected ischemic colitis**
- **ICU:** hemodynamic instability, right-sided colonic ischemia, peritoneal signs, lactate > 2 mmol/L
- **Floor:** mild left-sided disease with stable vitals, improving symptoms
- **Surgical follow-up:** all patients with moderate-severe disease
- **Colonoscopy follow-up at 4-6 weeks** to assess for stricture formation (10-20% of cases)
- **No discharge** until pain resolved, tolerating diet, stable hemodynamics

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing isolated right-sided ischemic colitis.** Right-sided involvement indicates SMA territory ischemia, carries much higher mortality (up to 50%), and frequently requires surgery. Always assess vascular distribution on CT.

2. **Attributing rectal bleeding to hemorrhoids without imaging.** In elderly patients with abdominal pain and rectal bleeding, ischemic colitis must be excluded before assuming a benign source.

3. **Using vasopressors aggressively without optimizing volume status.** Vasoconstrictors worsen mesenteric ischemia. Prioritize crystalloid resuscitation; use vasopressors at lowest effective dose only after adequate volume loading.

4. **Performing colonoscopy in patients with peritoneal signs.** Full colonoscopy in suspected gangrenous colitis risks perforation. Flexible sigmoidoscopy with minimal insufflation is safer; CT is preferred first.

5. **Failing to consider post-aortic surgery ischemic colitis.** Incidence is 0.5-10% after AAA repair. Any abdominal pain or bloody stool post-operatively warrants immediate evaluation.

6. **Ignoring medication-related causes.** Cocaine, methamphetamine, digoxin, triptans, and estrogen-containing OCP are treatable causes. Always review medication and substance use history.
