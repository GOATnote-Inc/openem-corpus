# Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) results from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal (gasserian) ganglion, specifically the ophthalmic division (V1). VZV travels anterogradely along the frontal, lacrimal, and nasociliary branches of V1 to produce dermatomal vesicular eruption and direct viral invasion of ocular structures. The nasociliary branch innervates the globe (cornea, iris, ciliary body), the tip and side of the nose, and the medial canthal skin. VZV causes both direct cytopathic injury and immune-mediated inflammation, which accounts for the chronic and recurrent nature of stromal keratitis and anterior uveitis.

**Epidemiology:** 4-20% of all herpes zoster cases involve V1. Approximately 50% of HZO patients develop ocular complications, and up to 25% of those develop chronic or recurrent disease. Incidence increases sharply after age 50 and in immunocompromised patients (HIV, transplant recipients, chemotherapy, chronic corticosteroids).

**Clinical Presentation:**
- **Prodrome (1-4 days before rash):** Unilateral periorbital pain, headache, malaise, fever. Pain may precede rash and mimic migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, or dental pathology.
- **Acute rash:** Unilateral vesicular eruption strictly respecting the V1 dermatome. Does NOT cross midline. Vesicles on an erythematous base, progressing from papules to vesicles to pustules to crusts over 7-10 days. Involves forehead, upper eyelid, and scalp.
- **Hutchinson sign:** Vesicles on the tip, side, or root of the nose indicate nasociliary nerve involvement. The nasociliary branch also innervates the cornea, iris, and ciliary body. Hutchinson sign is a strong predictor of ocular complications: relative risk 3.35 for ocular inflammation and 4.02 for corneal sensory denervation (Zaal 2003). When vesicles involve both the external and internal nasal branches, ocular inflammation is nearly universal. Absence of Hutchinson sign does NOT exclude ocular involvement -- approximately one-third of HZO patients without Hutchinson sign still develop ocular disease.

**Ocular Manifestations (in approximate order of frequency):**
- **Conjunctivitis:** Follicular or papillary conjunctivitis, often the earliest ocular finding. Self-limited.
- **Epithelial keratitis:** Punctate epithelial erosions (early, within first week) progressing to pseudodendrites. Pseudodendrites are elevated, mucous plaques with blunted terminal bulbs that stain with rose bengal but poorly with fluorescein -- distinguishing them from the true dendrites of HSV keratitis, which have terminal bulbs that stain brightly with fluorescein.
- **Stromal keratitis:** Nummular keratitis (multiple fine granular subepithelial infiltrates) appearing 10 days to months after onset. Disciform keratitis (stromal edema with Descemet folds, without ulceration). Immune-mediated, not active viral replication. Risk of corneal scarring and neovascularization.
- **Endotheliitis:** Keratic precipitates on the endothelium, corneal edema, elevated IOP. Immune-mediated or direct viral damage to endothelial cells.
- **Anterior uveitis:** Cells and flare in the anterior chamber, photophobia, circumlimbal injection. May be granulomatous (mutton-fat keratic precipitates) or nongranulomatous. Can cause posterior synechiae and secondary glaucoma. Occurs in 40-50% of HZO with ocular involvement.
- **Elevated IOP / secondary glaucoma:** From trabeculitis (direct viral inflammation of trabecular meshwork), inflammatory debris in the angle, or steroid-response glaucoma from topical corticosteroid use.
- **Scleritis / episcleritis:** Sectoral inflammation, deep boring pain. Scleritis may be necrotizing in immunocompromised patients.
- **Neurotrophic keratopathy:** Corneal anesthesia from nasociliary nerve damage leads to epithelial breakdown, persistent epithelial defects, stromal melting, and perforation. Develops weeks to months after acute HZO. Corneal sensation must be tested (cotton wisp or Cochet-Bonnet esthesiometer).
- **Cranial nerve palsies:** CN III, IV, or VI involvement in 10-15% of HZO. Ptosis, diplopia, ophthalmoplegia. Usually self-limited over weeks to months.
- **Acute retinal necrosis (rare):** VZV-mediated retinal vasculitis and necrosis. Vision-threatening emergency requiring IV antivirals and vitreoretinal consultation.

**ICD-10-CM Codes:**
- B02.30 -- Zoster ocular disease, unspecified
- B02.31 -- Zoster conjunctivitis
- B02.32 -- Zoster iridocyclitis
- B02.33 -- Zoster keratitis
- B02.34 -- Zoster scleritis

## Critical Actions

1. **Identify the Hutchinson sign.** Examine the nose carefully for vesicles on the tip, side, and root (nasociliary distribution). Its presence increases the risk of ocular complications 3-4 fold, but its absence does not exclude ocular involvement.
2. **Perform a fluorescein exam.** Instill fluorescein dye and examine with cobalt blue light (slit lamp or Wood lamp). Look for pseudodendrites (elevated mucous plaques with blunted ends) and punctate epithelial erosions. Pseudodendrites stain poorly with fluorescein but well with rose bengal or lissamine green.
3. **Check intraocular pressure (IOP).** Elevated IOP from trabeculitis or uveitis is common and may require treatment. Measure with tonometry (Tono-Pen in the ED if slit lamp is unavailable).
4. **Start systemic antivirals immediately.** Valacyclovir 1g PO TID for 7 days is first-line. Start within 72 hours of rash onset for maximum benefit. If presenting after 72 hours, still treat if new vesicles are appearing, ocular involvement is present, or the patient is immunocompromised.
5. **Arrange ophthalmology consultation within 24 hours** for any patient with ocular signs or symptoms (eye pain, photophobia, visual changes, conjunctival injection, corneal staining, cells/flare, elevated IOP, Hutchinson sign). Same-day consultation if stromal keratitis, uveitis, elevated IOP, or vision loss is detected.
6. **Do NOT start topical corticosteroids without ophthalmology guidance.** Inappropriate topical steroids in active epithelial keratitis worsen infection. In neurotrophic cornea, steroids accelerate stromal melting and risk perforation. Topical steroids are indicated for stromal keratitis and uveitis but require close ophthalmology follow-up for IOP monitoring and taper.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| HSV keratitis (herpes simplex) | True dendrites with terminal bulbs that stain brightly with fluorescein (vs. HZO pseudodendrites: blunted ends, mucous plaques). HSV typically has no dermatomal rash. HSV recurrences are more frequent but corneal disease is usually unilateral. No dermatomal vesicular eruption. History of prior cold sores or recurrent keratitis. |
| Preseptal / orbital cellulitis | Eyelid erythema and edema mimics early HZO before vesicles appear. Cellulitis lacks vesicular rash, dermatomal distribution, and typically has a preceding sinusitis, trauma, or insect bite. Fever and leukocytosis more prominent. CT orbit with contrast shows preseptal or postseptal inflammation. |
| Allergic contact dermatitis (periorbital) | Bilateral or asymmetric. Pruritic rather than painful. No vesicles in dermatomal distribution. History of cosmetic, ophthalmic drop, or environmental exposure. No ocular inflammation. |
| HSV zosteriform eruption | HSV can rarely cause a dermatomal vesicular rash mimicking zoster. Consider in young patients or atypical presentations. Viral culture or PCR distinguishes VZV from HSV. |
| Anterior uveitis (non-herpetic) | HLA-B27-associated, sarcoidosis, or idiopathic anterior uveitis presents with cells and flare but no dermatomal skin rash. Skin exam is key. |
| Acute angle-closure glaucoma | Severe eye pain, headache, nausea, mid-dilated fixed pupil, corneal edema, markedly elevated IOP (>40 mmHg). No dermatomal rash. Shallow anterior chamber on slit lamp. |
| Trigeminal neuralgia | Lancinating facial pain in V1 distribution without rash. HZO prodrome pain before rash onset can mimic trigeminal neuralgia. Diagnosis clarified when vesicles appear. |
| Impetigo (facial) | Honey-crusted lesions, not vesicular on erythematous base. No dermatomal distribution. Culture grows Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. No ocular involvement. |

## Workup

**Bedside (ED):**
- **Visual acuity** (each eye, with correction) -- baseline and to detect vision loss from corneal or anterior chamber involvement
- **Slit lamp examination:** Mandatory for any suspected HZO. Fluorescein staining under cobalt blue light for pseudodendrites and epithelial defects. Examine the anterior chamber for cells and flare (anterior uveitis). Look for keratic precipitates on the endothelium. Check for posterior synechiae.
- **Intraocular pressure** -- tonometry (Goldmann applanation, Tono-Pen, or iCare). Elevated IOP from trabeculitis or steroid response is common. Low IOP may indicate ciliary body shutdown from severe inflammation.
- **Corneal sensation** -- test with a cotton wisp or tissue corner before instilling anesthetic drops. Decreased sensation indicates nasociliary nerve involvement and risk of neurotrophic keratopathy.
- **Pupillary exam** -- look for RAPD (extensive retinal or optic nerve involvement, rare) and irregular pupil (posterior synechiae from uveitis)
- **Extraocular movements** -- cranial nerve III, IV, VI palsies occur in 10-15% of HZO
- **Fundoscopy** (dilated if no contraindication) -- rule out acute retinal necrosis in patients with significant vision loss or vitritis

**Laboratory:**
- Clinical diagnosis in most cases. Laboratory confirmation rarely needed.
- **VZV PCR** (vesicle fluid swab or corneal scraping) -- when diagnosis uncertain, atypical presentation, immunocompromised patient, or differentiation from HSV needed
- **Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA)** of vesicle scraping -- rapid, less sensitive than PCR
- **HIV testing** -- in any patient <50 years with HZO or with multidermatomal/disseminated zoster; HZO may be the presenting sign of undiagnosed HIV
- **CBC, BMP** -- baseline in immunocompromised patients or those requiring IV acyclovir (creatinine for renal dosing)

**Imaging:**
- **CT orbit with contrast** -- only if orbital apex syndrome suspected (ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, vision loss suggesting posterior orbital involvement) or to differentiate from orbital cellulitis
- **MRI brain/orbits** -- if suspected VZV vasculitis, encephalitis, or cranial nerve involvement beyond typical CN III/IV/VI palsies

## Treatment

**Systemic Antiviral Therapy -- All Patients:**
- **Valacyclovir 1000 mg PO TID x 7 days** (first-line; superior bioavailability and TID dosing improves compliance over acyclovir 5x/day)
- **Alternative: Famciclovir 500 mg PO TID x 7 days** (equivalent efficacy)
- **Alternative: Acyclovir 800 mg PO 5x/day x 7-10 days** (original regimen; lower bioavailability, worse compliance)
- Start within 72 hours of rash onset for maximum benefit. Oral acyclovir reduces the incidence of keratitis and uveitis even when started within 7 days of rash onset (Cobo 1988).
- **Treat beyond 72 hours if:** new vesicles are still forming, any ocular involvement is present, or the patient is immunocompromised. HZO is an exception to the general 72-hour window for uncomplicated zoster.

**Immunocompromised Patients:**
- **Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8h for 7-10 days** (for severely immunocompromised: active AIDS, transplant recipients on immunosuppression, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia)
- Transition to oral valacyclovir to complete 10-14 days total once clinically improving and able to tolerate PO
- Renal dose adjustment required: check creatinine clearance; reduce dose and/or extend interval for CrCl <50 mL/min
- Ensure adequate IV hydration to prevent acyclovir crystalline nephropathy (bolus 500-1000 mL NS before first dose, maintain hydration throughout)

**Topical Ophthalmic Treatment (with ophthalmology guidance):**
- **Topical corticosteroids** (prednisolone acetate 1% or dexamethasone 0.1%) -- for stromal keratitis, endotheliitis, and anterior uveitis. Must NOT be used for active epithelial keratitis (worsens viral replication). Requires IOP monitoring (steroid-response glaucoma risk). Taper slowly under ophthalmology supervision; rapid taper causes inflammatory rebound.
- **Cycloplegic agents** (cyclopentolate 1% BID-TID or atropine 1% BID) -- for anterior uveitis. Reduces ciliary spasm pain and prevents posterior synechiae formation by keeping the pupil mobile.
- **IOP-lowering agents** -- topical timolol 0.5% BID, brimonidine 0.2% TID, or oral acetazolamide 250 mg QID for elevated IOP from trabeculitis. Avoid prostaglandin analogs (may worsen inflammation). Avoid pilocarpine (worsens synechiae and ciliary spasm).
- **Preservative-free artificial tears** -- for epithelial surface support and comfort, especially with neurotrophic keratopathy.
- **Do NOT use topical antivirals (trifluridine, ganciclovir gel) as monotherapy.** Unlike HSV keratitis, HZO epithelial keratitis is managed primarily with systemic antivirals. Topical antivirals have limited penetration and significant corneal toxicity with prolonged use.

**Pain Management (Acute):**
- NSAIDs: ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6h or ketorolac 15-30 mg IV
- Opioids for severe pain: oxycodone 5-10 mg PO q4-6h PRN
- Gabapentin 300 mg PO TID (can titrate up) -- start early; may reduce acute zoster pain and is first-line for postherpetic neuralgia
- Cool compresses to affected skin (do NOT apply to the eye)
- Keep vesicles clean and dry; avoid topical antibiotics to rash unless secondary bacterial superinfection

**Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN) Management:**
- PHN occurs in 10-20% of HZO patients; risk increases with age >50
- First-line: gabapentin 300 mg PO TID, titrate to 1800-3600 mg/day in 3 divided doses; OR pregabalin 75 mg PO BID, titrate to 300 mg/day
- Second-line: tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline or nortriptyline 25 mg PO qHS, titrate to 75-150 mg/day) -- caution in elderly (anticholinergic effects)
- Third-line: topical lidocaine 5% patch to affected dermatome; topical capsaicin 8% patch (single application by trained provider)
- Refer to pain management if refractory

## Disposition

**Same-Day Ophthalmology Consultation:**
- Corneal staining (pseudodendrites, epithelial defects, stromal infiltrates)
- Anterior uveitis (cells and flare)
- Elevated IOP
- Vision loss or decreased visual acuity
- Scleritis
- Cranial nerve palsy
- Suspected acute retinal necrosis

**Ophthalmology Consultation Within 24 Hours:**
- Hutchinson sign present (even without current ocular findings -- high risk of delayed ocular complications)
- Any conjunctival injection or eye complaints in the setting of V1 zoster

**Admit:**
- Immunocompromised patients requiring IV acyclovir
- Disseminated zoster (>20 vesicles outside primary and adjacent dermatomes)
- Orbital apex syndrome (ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, vision loss)
- Suspected VZV meningoencephalitis or vasculitis
- Acute retinal necrosis (requires IV acyclovir and vitreoretinal consultation)
- Inability to tolerate oral medications or maintain hydration

**Discharge Criteria (must meet ALL):**
- Immunocompetent
- Able to tolerate oral antivirals
- Adequate pain control
- Ophthalmology consultation completed or confirmed within 24 hours
- Access to prescribed medications
- Reliable follow-up
- Written return precautions provided

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Complete full 7-day antiviral course even if rash improves
- Ophthalmology follow-up within 24-48 hours (document the appointment or referral)
- Return immediately for: worsening eye pain, decreasing vision, increasing light sensitivity, eye redness worsening, new eye symptoms in either eye
- Rash is contagious to individuals who have never had varicella and have not been vaccinated (transmits as primary varicella, not as zoster). Avoid contact with pregnant women who are seronegative, neonates, and immunocompromised individuals until all lesions have crusted.
- Long-term ophthalmology follow-up is essential -- ocular complications (stromal keratitis, uveitis, glaucoma, neurotrophic keratopathy) can develop weeks to months after the acute rash resolves

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for vesicles to diagnose HZO.** The prodromal phase (1-4 days of unilateral V1 pain, headache, and malaise before rash) is frequently misdiagnosed as migraine, trigeminal neuralgia, dental pain, or sinusitis. If a patient returns with new dermatomal vesicles after a pain visit, start antivirals immediately and refer to ophthalmology -- the 72-hour treatment window may have already closed during the prodrome.

2. **Relying on the absence of Hutchinson sign to exclude ocular involvement.** Approximately one-third of HZO patients without vesicles on the nose still develop ocular disease. Every patient with V1 zoster needs a slit lamp examination and ophthalmology referral regardless of nasal tip findings. Hutchinson sign increases risk but does not define it.

3. **Confusing HZO pseudodendrites with HSV true dendrites.** This distinction changes management entirely. HZO pseudodendrites are elevated mucous plaques with blunted terminal ends that stain poorly with fluorescein but well with rose bengal. HSV true dendrites have sharp terminal bulbs that stain brightly with fluorescein. Treating HZO with topical antivirals alone (as for HSV) is inadequate -- systemic antivirals are required. Misidentifying HZO as HSV delays appropriate treatment and misses the dermatomal rash.

4. **Starting topical corticosteroids in the ED without ophthalmology guidance.** Topical steroids are beneficial for stromal keratitis and uveitis but are contraindicated in active epithelial keratitis (enhance viral replication). In neurotrophic cornea, steroids inhibit epithelial healing and accelerate stromal melting, risking perforation. Steroids also cause steroid-response glaucoma in 30-40% of patients. Initiate topical steroids only with ophthalmology direction and a plan for close IOP monitoring.

5. **Not checking intraocular pressure.** IOP elevation from trabeculitis or steroid-response glaucoma is common in HZO and is asymptomatic until advanced. Unrecognized elevated IOP can cause optic nerve damage. Measure IOP at every visit. Equally, markedly low IOP with hypotony may indicate severe ciliary body inflammation requiring aggressive treatment.

6. **Stopping antivirals at 72 hours because the "window has closed."** In HZO, the 72-hour rule for uncomplicated zoster does not apply rigidly. Antivirals should be started in HZO regardless of timing if the patient has active vesicle formation, any ocular involvement, or is immunocompromised. The Cobo study demonstrated benefit when treatment was started within 7 days of rash onset. Withholding antivirals in a patient with active HZO because they present on day 4 is a preventable error.

7. **Failing to test corneal sensation.** Nasociliary nerve damage causes corneal anesthesia, which sets the stage for neurotrophic keratopathy -- persistent epithelial defects, stromal melting, and perforation that develop weeks to months later. Test corneal sensation with a cotton wisp before instilling anesthetic drops. Document the finding. Patients with decreased corneal sensation need close ophthalmology follow-up and preservative-free lubrication.

8. **Not screening young patients for HIV.** HZO in patients under 50, multidermatomal zoster, recurrent zoster, or disseminated zoster should prompt HIV testing. HZO may be the first presentation of undiagnosed HIV/AIDS. Missing this diagnosis has profound implications for the patient's long-term care.

9. **Discharging without confirmed ophthalmology follow-up.** Ocular complications of HZO are frequently delayed -- stromal keratitis, uveitis, secondary glaucoma, and neurotrophic keratopathy can develop weeks to months after the acute rash. A patient discharged with "see your eye doctor" and no confirmed appointment may not follow up until vision loss has occurred. Document the ophthalmology appointment or referral before discharge. Ensure the patient understands that long-term ophthalmic follow-up (months to years) is necessary, not just a single visit.

10. **Forgetting about postherpetic neuralgia.** PHN affects 10-20% of HZO patients and can be severely debilitating, persisting for months to years. Early initiation of gabapentin during the acute phase may reduce the transition to chronic neuropathic pain. Counsel patients about PHN at discharge, and ensure a pain management plan is in place for follow-up.
