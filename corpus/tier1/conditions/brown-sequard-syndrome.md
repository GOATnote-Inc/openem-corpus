# Brown-Sequard Syndrome

## Recognition

**Classic presentation (spinal cord hemisection):**
- **Ipsilateral to lesion:** motor paralysis (corticospinal tract), loss of proprioception and vibration (dorsal columns)
- **Contralateral to lesion:** loss of pain and temperature sensation (spinothalamic tract) — onset 1-2 levels below injury
- Pure hemisection is rare; most cases are "Brown-Sequard plus" with incomplete features

**Typical etiologies:**
- Penetrating trauma (stab wounds, GSW) — most common cause
- Blunt trauma with unilateral fracture-dislocation
- Non-traumatic: spinal cord tumors, epidural hematoma, epidural abscess, multiple sclerosis, disc herniation

**Key exam findings:**
- Ipsilateral: weakness/paralysis, hyperreflexia (or areflexia in spinal shock), Babinski sign, loss of vibration/proprioception, Horner syndrome (if cervical)
- Contralateral: loss of pain/temperature 1-2 levels below lesion
- Preserved sensation to light touch ipsilaterally (anterior spinothalamic tract)
- Sacral sparing may be present

## Critical Actions

1. **Full spinal immobilization** if traumatic etiology
2. **Emergent MRI** of the spine at suspected level — identifies cord compression, hemorrhage, mass lesion
3. **Maintain MAP >= 75-80 mmHg** for 5-7 days per 2024 AANS hemodynamic guidelines
4. **Neurosurgery consultation** — urgent decompression for compressive lesions (epidural hematoma, abscess, tumor, disc)
5. **If penetrating trauma:** do NOT remove impaled objects; surgical exploration required
6. **Foley catheter** and close monitoring of neurogenic bladder

## Differential Diagnosis

- Central cord syndrome (bilateral upper > lower extremity weakness)
- Anterior cord syndrome (bilateral motor and pain/temperature loss, preserved proprioception)
- Complete spinal cord transection (bilateral complete loss)
- Unilateral radiculopathy (dermatomal pattern, no contralateral deficits)
- Epidural abscess (fever, back pain, progressive; may mimic if unilateral)
- Spinal cord tumor (subacute progression)
- Transverse myelitis (bilateral, inflammatory CSF)

## Workup

- **CT spine** at level of injury — identify fracture, foreign body, bone fragments
- **MRI spine** — essential; demonstrates hemisection pattern, edema, hemorrhage, extrinsic compression
- **CT angiography** if vascular injury suspected (penetrating neck/trunk trauma)
- **CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, type and screen** (for surgical planning)
- **ASIA exam** — document motor and sensory levels bilaterally
- **Blood cultures, ESR, CRP** if epidural abscess suspected

## Treatment

### Hemodynamic Management
- MAP >= 75-80 mmHg for 5-7 days (arterial line for continuous monitoring)
- Norepinephrine 0.05-0.3 mcg/kg/min IV first-line if vasopressor needed
- IV fluid resuscitation: lactated Ringer's 1-2 L bolus for hypotension

### Surgical Management
- Emergent decompression for compressive lesions (epidural hematoma, abscess, tumor)
- Penetrating injuries: surgical exploration, debridement, stabilization
- Timing: early surgery (< 24 hours) recommended for incomplete SCI with ongoing compression

### Medical Management
- Epidural abscess: IV antibiotics (vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h) PLUS surgical drainage
- DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin 30 mg SQ q12h starting within 72 hours
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole 40 mg IV daily
- Neuropathic pain: gabapentin 300 mg PO TID, titrate to 3600 mg/day as tolerated
- Bowel regimen: docusate 100 mg PO BID + bisacodyl 10 mg PR daily
- Spasticity (subacute): baclofen 5 mg PO TID, titrate

## Disposition

- **All acute Brown-Sequard:** ICU admission for hemodynamic monitoring
- **Surgical emergencies** (epidural abscess, acute hematoma): OR immediately
- **Stable traumatic injury:** neurosurgical ICU, serial neuro exams q4h
- **Transfer criteria:** facilities without MRI, neurosurgery, or spine surgery capability must transfer immediately

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing Brown-Sequard pattern in partial presentations.** Pure hemisection is rare. "Brown-Sequard plus" syndrome with incomplete features is common and easily overlooked if clinicians only look for the textbook pattern.

2. **Failing to image the correct spinal level.** The contralateral pain/temperature loss begins 1-2 levels BELOW the lesion due to spinothalamic tract anatomy. The motor level ipsilaterally identifies the actual lesion level.

3. **Not obtaining MRI for non-traumatic etiologies.** Epidural abscess, hematoma, and tumor can present as Brown-Sequard. CT alone misses soft tissue compression.

4. **Delayed DVT prophylaxis.** SCI patients have extremely high DVT rates (up to 80% without prophylaxis). Initiate anticoagulation within 72 hours unless active hemorrhage contraindicates.

5. **Underestimating prognosis and undertreating.** Brown-Sequard has the best prognosis of all incomplete SCI patterns — 75-90% regain ambulatory function. Aggressive rehabilitation referral is essential.
