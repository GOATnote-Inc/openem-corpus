# Spinal Epidural Abscess

## Recognition

**Definition:** Infection within the epidural space of the spinal canal, causing direct compression and/or ischemia of the spinal cord or cauda equina. Most commonly posterior in the thoracolumbar spine.

**Incidence:** 2-12 per 100,000 hospital admissions; incidence rising with increased IVDU and spinal procedures. Peak age 50-70 years.

**Classic Triad (present in only 10-15% of cases):**
1. Back pain (most common presenting symptom — 70-90%)
2. Fever (present in 50-65%)
3. Neurological deficit (present at diagnosis in 33-50%)

**Risk Factors:**
- IV drug use (strongest risk factor — present in 25-50% of cases)
- Diabetes mellitus
- Immunosuppression (HIV, chronic steroids, chemotherapy, transplant)
- Recent spinal procedure (epidural injection, surgery, lumbar puncture)
- Indwelling spinal hardware
- Remote infection source: skin/soft tissue abscess, endocarditis, UTI, dental abscess
- Hemodialysis with vascular access
- Alcoholism, cirrhosis
- Spinal trauma

**Pathophysiology:**
- Hematogenous spread (most common) from distant site
- Direct extension from vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis or psoas abscess
- Direct inoculation from spinal procedure
- Organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (60-70%, including MRSA), gram-negative rods (15-20%), streptococci (8-10%), TB in endemic areas, polymicrobial in IVDU

**Stages of Progression (Heusner classification):**
1. **Stage 1:** Back pain at affected level, localized tenderness, fever
2. **Stage 2:** Radiculopathy — nerve root pain radiating into limbs or trunk
3. **Stage 3:** Motor weakness, sensory deficits, bowel/bladder dysfunction
4. **Stage 4:** Paralysis (often irreversible within 24-48 hours of onset)

**Presentation — The Classic ED Miss:**
- Back pain is the most common chief complaint in the ED. The vast majority of back pain is benign. SEA hides in this volume.
- Pain is often severe, progressive over days to weeks, worse with percussion over the spine
- Midline spinal tenderness to palpation or percussion (point tenderness)
- Fever may be absent, especially in immunosuppressed patients
- Neurological deficits develop hours to days after pain onset and progress rapidly
- Bowel/bladder dysfunction (urinary retention, incontinence) — late and ominous

## Critical Actions

1. **Maintain high suspicion** in any patient with back pain PLUS fever, IVDU, immunosuppression, recent spinal procedure, or bacteremia. The triad is incomplete in 85% of cases — do not wait for all three.
2. **Perform a thorough neurological exam** — motor strength, sensation, reflexes, rectal tone, post-void residual. Document baseline for serial comparison.
3. **MRI with gadolinium of the entire spine** — gold standard. Order emergently. Abscess can be non-contiguous; partial-spine imaging misses 10-15% of cases.
4. **Blood cultures x 2** — positive in 60% of cases. Draw BEFORE antibiotics.
5. **Start empiric antibiotics immediately** if clinical suspicion is high — do NOT delay for MRI.
6. **Emergent neurosurgical or spine surgery consultation** — within hours if any neurological deficit. Decompression within 24-48 hours of deficit onset is critical for recovery.
7. **Serial neurological exams q2-4h** — progression can be rapid and demands urgent surgical reassessment.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis | Overlaps heavily (often coexists with SEA); subacute course, insidious onset, MRI distinguishes |
| Musculoskeletal back pain | No fever, no neurological deficits, no risk factors, non-progressive, normal labs |
| Spinal cord compression (malignancy) | History of cancer, weight loss, progressive over weeks, MRI diagnostic |
| Transverse myelitis | Bilateral deficits, acute onset, no fever, MRI shows intramedullary signal change |
| Cauda equina syndrome (disc herniation) | Saddle anesthesia, urinary retention, no fever, MRI shows disc compression |
| Guillain-Barre syndrome | Ascending weakness, areflexia, no back pain predominance, no fever, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation |
| Herpes zoster (pre-rash) | Dermatomal pain, unilateral, no motor deficits (usually), vesicular rash appears within days |
| Psoas abscess | Flank/hip pain, pain with hip flexion, fever, CT diagnostic |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- Blood cultures x 2 (positive in 60%) — BEFORE antibiotics
- CBC with differential (leukocytosis > 12,000 in 65%; may be normal)
- ESR: elevated (> 20 mm/h) in > 95% of cases — most sensitive lab marker. Mean ESR ~75 mm/h.
- CRP: elevated in > 90% of cases. Mean CRP ~100 mg/L. More rapidly responsive than ESR.
- Procalcitonin: may support bacterial etiology but not specific to SEA
- BMP, hepatic panel (baseline before prolonged antibiotics)
- Urinalysis and urine culture (to identify source)
- HIV testing (if not recently documented)

**Imaging:**
- **MRI with gadolinium of the ENTIRE spine** — gold standard. Sensitivity 91-95%, specificity 90-94%. Shows:
  - Epidural collection (T1 iso/hypointense, T2 hyperintense, rim-enhancing with gadolinium)
  - Associated vertebral osteomyelitis/discitis
  - Degree of spinal cord compression
  - Non-contiguous lesions (present in 10-15%)
- **CT myelogram** — alternative if MRI contraindicated (pacemaker, extreme claustrophobia). Less sensitive. Risk of seeding meningeal space.
- **Plain radiographs** — insensitive early; may show disc space narrowing or endplate erosion in late osteomyelitis. NOT adequate to rule out SEA.

**Tissue/Fluid:**
- CT-guided aspiration or intraoperative culture of abscess — definitive microbiologic diagnosis
- If blood cultures negative and no surgery planned, image-guided biopsy strongly recommended for targeted therapy

## Treatment

**Empiric Antibiotics — Start Immediately (do not delay for MRI):**

| Regimen | Dose | Coverage |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Vancomycin** | 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (target trough 15-20 mcg/mL) | MRSA, MSSA, streptococci |
| PLUS **Ceftriaxone** | 2 g IV q12h | Gram-negative rods |
| OR PLUS **Cefepime** | 2 g IV q8h | Broader gram-negative coverage including Pseudomonas (for IVDU, immunocompromised) |
| OR PLUS **Meropenem** | 2 g IV q8h | Broadest gram-negative coverage; use if Pseudomonas or ESBL-producing organisms suspected |

- Add **metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h** if polymicrobial/anaerobic infection suspected (pelvic source, post-procedural)
- Duration: IV antibiotics for minimum 6 weeks (8-12 weeks if concurrent osteomyelitis). Transition to oral guided by cultures and infectious disease consultation.
- If TB suspected (endemic area, subacute course, risk factors): add RIPE therapy pending AFB cultures

**Surgical Decompression:**
- **Indications for emergent surgery (within 24 hours):**
  - Any neurological deficit (motor weakness, bowel/bladder dysfunction)
  - Neurological deterioration on serial exam
  - Progressive deficit despite antibiotics
  - Spinal cord compression on MRI with clinical correlation
  - Failure to improve on IV antibiotics (worsening pain, rising inflammatory markers)
- **Surgical approach:** Posterior laminectomy with abscess drainage most common. Instrumented fusion if instability.
- **Critical timing:** Patients decompressed within 24-48 hours of neurological deficit onset have significantly better outcomes. Once paralysis has been present > 48-72 hours, recovery is unlikely.

**Medical Management Alone (without surgery):**
- Selected cases only:
  - No neurological deficit
  - Small abscess without significant cord compression
  - Organism identified on blood cultures
  - Prohibitive surgical risk
- Requires serial MRI (q2-4 weeks), serial neurological exams, close infectious disease follow-up
- Immediate surgical reassessment if any neurological change

## Disposition

**Admission (all patients with confirmed or strongly suspected SEA):**
- ICU or step-down if septic, hemodynamically unstable, or post-operative
- Neurosurgical or spine surgery service (primary)
- Infectious disease consultation
- Serial neurological exams q2-4h for first 48-72 hours

**Transfer:**
- If facility lacks emergent MRI capability, neurosurgery, or spine surgery — arrange emergent transfer. Start empiric antibiotics and serial neuro exams before and during transport.

**Discharge:**
- SEA is NOT a discharge diagnosis. If MRI is negative and clinical suspicion was low-to-moderate, ensure adequate follow-up and clear return precautions for worsening pain, fever, or any neurological symptoms.

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing back pain with fever as "UTI plus muscle strain."** SEA presents as back pain. Fever plus back pain in a patient with any risk factor (IVDU, diabetes, immunosuppression, recent spinal procedure) demands MRI. The cost of a missed SEA is permanent paralysis.

2. **Waiting for the complete triad.** Back pain, fever, and neurological deficit are simultaneously present in only 10-15% of cases at initial presentation. Most patients present with back pain alone or back pain plus fever. Requiring all three before imaging guarantees late diagnosis.

3. **Relying on normal WBC to exclude SEA.** WBC is normal in 35-40% of patients with SEA. ESR and CRP are far more sensitive — ESR > 20 mm/h in > 95% of cases. A normal WBC with elevated ESR/CRP and back pain risk factors still warrants MRI.

4. **Ordering MRI of only the symptomatic segment.** SEA can involve non-contiguous segments in 10-15% of cases. MRI of the entire spine with gadolinium is the standard. A lumbar-only MRI may miss a concurrent thoracic abscess.

5. **Delaying antibiotics until after MRI.** If clinical suspicion is moderate-to-high, start empiric vancomycin + ceftriaxone immediately. Blood cultures drawn before antibiotics remain positive in the majority. A 2-hour antibiotic delay does not sterilize an abscess but may prevent bacteremic seeding of other sites.

6. **Failing to perform serial neurological exams.** SEA progresses from pain to radiculopathy to weakness to paralysis over hours. A patient who was neurologically intact at 2 AM may have dense motor deficits by 8 AM. Neuro checks q2-4h with documented motor/sensory/rectal tone are mandatory.

7. **Not consulting neurosurgery early enough.** Even in the absence of deficits, neurosurgery should be aware of the patient from the time of diagnosis. Surgical planning takes time; if deficits develop, the window for decompression is narrow (24-48 hours). Late consultation compresses an already tight timeline.

8. **Attributing neurological symptoms to "radiculopathy" in a febrile IVDU patient.** IVDU is the single strongest risk factor for SEA. A febrile IVDU patient with back pain and radiating leg symptoms has SEA until MRI proves otherwise. Do not anchor on musculoskeletal diagnoses.

9. **Inadequate empiric antibiotic coverage.** MRSA causes 30-40% of SEA in IVDU populations. Vancomycin is mandatory for empiric coverage. Ceftriaxone alone is insufficient. In IVDU or immunocompromised patients, add Pseudomonas coverage with cefepime or meropenem.

10. **Assuming medical management success without serial imaging.** Patients managed without surgery require repeat MRI at 2-4 weeks to confirm abscess regression. Clinical improvement alone is insufficient — the abscess may persist or enlarge despite symptom improvement on antibiotics.
