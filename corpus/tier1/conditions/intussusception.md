# Intussusception

## Recognition

**Definition:** Invagination (telescoping) of a proximal segment of bowel into a distal segment. Ileocolic (ileum into cecum/ascending colon) is the most common type in children (90%).

**Epidemiology:**
- Most common cause of bowel obstruction in children 6 months to 3 years
- Peak incidence 5-10 months
- Male:female ratio 3:1
- Incidence: 56 per 100,000 children < 1 year

**Pathophysiology:**
- Hypertrophied Peyer patches (lymphoid tissue) serve as lead point after viral illness (most common in idiopathic cases)
- Telescoping causes mesenteric venous obstruction → edema → arterial compromise → ischemia → necrosis → perforation
- Pathologic lead points (5-10% of cases): Meckel diverticulum, polyp, lymphoma, duplication cyst, Henoch-Schonlein purpura — suspect in children > 3 years or recurrent intussusception

**Classic Triad (present in < 20% of cases):**
- Colicky abdominal pain (episodic)
- Currant jelly stool (bloody mucoid stool — late finding indicating mucosal ischemia)
- Palpable abdominal mass (sausage-shaped, RUQ)

**Presentation:**
- Episodic, severe, colicky abdominal pain with pain-free intervals (85%)
- Child draws knees to chest during episodes, inconsolable
- Vomiting (initially non-bilious, becomes bilious with obstruction) (80%)
- Lethargy between episodes — can be the sole presenting sign (may mimic sepsis)
- Pallor during pain episodes
- Currant jelly stool (late sign, present in 30-60%; indicates mucosal compromise)
- Palpable sausage-shaped mass in RUQ or epigastrium (60%)
- Empty RLQ (Dance sign)
- Abdominal distension (late, with obstruction)

**Key Point:** Lethargy in an infant may be the ONLY presenting sign. An infant with episodic lethargy or altered mental status should prompt evaluation for intussusception.

## Critical Actions

1. **NPO** — make the child NPO immediately upon clinical suspicion. Reduction (air or contrast enema) and potential surgery require an empty stomach.
2. **IV access and fluid resuscitation** — NS 20 mL/kg bolus for dehydration or hemodynamic instability. Repeat as needed.
3. **Surgical consultation early** — notify surgery before diagnostic studies. If perforation, peritonitis, or hemodynamic instability: operative management.
4. **Ultrasound** — first-line diagnostic study. Target sign (transverse) and pseudokidney sign (longitudinal) are diagnostic.
5. **Enema reduction** — air enema (preferred) or hydrostatic contrast enema under fluoroscopy. Performed by radiology with surgery on standby.
6. **Do NOT attempt enema reduction if:** perforation suspected (free air), peritonitis, hemodynamic instability/shock, or prolonged symptoms > 48 hours with signs of necrosis.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Gastroenteritis | Diarrhea is watery (not bloody mucoid), no colicky pattern, no mass, no obstruction |
| Meckel diverticulum (bleeding) | Painless rectal bleeding (maroon/bright red), Meckel scan positive |
| Malrotation with midgut volvulus | Bilious vomiting in neonate, upper GI series shows abnormal ligament of Treitz position |
| Incarcerated inguinal hernia | Inguinal mass, non-reducible, tender |
| Henoch-Schonlein purpura | Palpable purpura (legs/buttocks), arthritis, colicky abdominal pain — HSP itself is a cause of intussusception (ileoileal) |
| Testicular torsion | Testicular pain/swelling, high-riding testis, absent cremasteric reflex |
| Appendicitis | RLQ pain, fever, migration from periumbilical area, elevated WBC |
| Constipation | Hard stools, no mass on US, responds to treatment |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- **Ultrasound (first-line, sensitivity 97-100%, specificity 88-100%):**
  - Target sign (doughnut sign): concentric rings in transverse view
  - Pseudokidney sign: in longitudinal view
  - Assess for free fluid (may indicate perforation or ischemia)
  - Trapped lymph nodes within intussusceptum
  - Absence of Doppler flow suggests bowel wall necrosis
  - Small bowel intussusception (ileoileal): often transient, self-resolving; less clinically significant unless persistent

- **Abdominal X-ray:**
  - Not sensitive for diagnosis (sensitivity 45-50%)
  - May show: target sign, meniscus sign, absence of gas in RLQ, small bowel obstruction pattern
  - Primary utility: identify free air (perforation) prior to enema
  - Normal X-ray does NOT exclude intussusception

**Labs:**
- CBC (leukocytosis nonspecific)
- BMP (dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities from vomiting)
- Blood type and screen (if surgery anticipated)
- Stool guaiac (occult blood)

## Treatment

**Enema Reduction (non-operative management):**
- **Air enema (pneumatic reduction):** preferred at most centers. Reduction rate 80-95%.
  - Performed under fluoroscopy by radiology
  - Air insufflated via rectal catheter at 80-120 mmHg (max 120 mmHg)
  - Success defined by free flow of air into terminal ileum
  - Surgery must be on standby
  - Contraindications: free air, peritonitis, shock, clinical signs of perforation/necrosis

- **Hydrostatic reduction (contrast or saline enema):**
  - Barium or water-soluble contrast under fluoroscopy, or saline under US guidance
  - Similar success rates
  - US-guided saline enema gaining popularity (no radiation)

- **Post-reduction observation:** minimum 12-24 hours. Recurrence rate 5-10% (most within first 24 hours).

**Operative Management (indications):**
- Failed enema reduction (up to 3 attempts at some centers)
- Perforation or free air on imaging
- Peritonitis on exam
- Hemodynamic instability/shock
- Pathologic lead point suspected (age > 3 years, recurrent intussusception)
- Prolonged symptoms with concern for bowel necrosis

**Surgical options:**
- Manual operative reduction (milking the intussusceptum out)
- Bowel resection with primary anastomosis if necrotic bowel found
- Laparoscopic approach increasingly used

**Supportive Care:**
- IV fluid resuscitation: NS 20 mL/kg bolus, reassess, repeat as needed
- NG/OG tube for decompression if vomiting/distension
- Ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg) for vomiting
- Pain management: morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q3-4h or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV q1-2h
- NPO until reduction confirmed and surgical plan determined
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics if perforation suspected: piperacillin-tazobactam 100 mg/kg IV (piperacillin component, max 4 g) q8h

## Disposition

**Admission (post-successful enema reduction):**
- Observation for 12-24 hours post-reduction
- Monitor for recurrence (return of colicky pain, vomiting, bloody stool)
- Advance diet as tolerated after successful reduction
- Recurrence occurs in 5-10%, most within 24 hours

**Surgical Admission:**
- Failed enema reduction
- Operative reduction performed
- Bowel resection required
- Peritonitis or perforation

**ICU Admission:**
- Septic shock from perforation
- Massive resuscitation required
- Post-operative monitoring after complex resection

**Discharge:**
- NOT appropriate from the ED — admit for observation after all reductions (risk of early recurrence)
- Return precautions: recurrent colicky pain, vomiting, bloody stool, lethargy, fever

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing symptoms to gastroenteritis.** Vomiting + irritability in a 6-18 month old is intussusception until proven otherwise. Gastroenteritis has watery diarrhea; intussusception has episodic pain, currant jelly stool (or no stool), and a sausage-shaped mass. Misdiagnosis as "stomach virus" is the most common diagnostic error.

2. **Waiting for the classic triad.** The triad of colicky pain + currant jelly stool + palpable mass is present in fewer than 20% of cases. Currant jelly stool is a late finding indicating mucosal ischemia — waiting for it delays diagnosis.

3. **Misinterpreting lethargy as a benign post-viral state.** Episodic lethargy or altered mental status in an infant can be the sole presenting sign of intussusception. An infant who is intermittently inconsolable then limp/lethargic warrants abdominal ultrasound.

4. **Using plain X-ray to exclude intussusception.** Abdominal X-ray sensitivity for intussusception is only 45-50%. A normal X-ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Ultrasound is the diagnostic standard with sensitivity > 97%.

5. **Attempting enema reduction with perforation.** Enema reduction in the presence of free air, peritonitis, or hemodynamic instability causes tension pneumoperitoneum and death. Obtain an upright or decubitus abdominal film to exclude free air before enema. Surgical consultation before enema is mandatory.

6. **Not suspecting pathologic lead point in older children.** Intussusception in children > 3 years has a higher likelihood of a pathologic lead point (lymphoma, polyp, Meckel diverticulum). These cases have higher failure rates with enema reduction and often require surgery. Recurrent intussusception also suggests a lead point.

7. **Discharging after successful reduction without observation.** Recurrence rate is 5-10% within the first 24 hours after enema reduction. Admitting for 12-24 hours of observation is standard of care. Discharge directly from the ED post-reduction risks missing early recurrence.

8. **Forgetting HSP as a cause.** Henoch-Schonlein purpura causes intussusception (typically ileoileal, not ileocolic), which is often not amenable to enema reduction. A child with purpura, joint pain, and colicky abdominal pain needs abdominal imaging.
