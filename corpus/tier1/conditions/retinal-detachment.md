# Retinal Detachment

## Recognition

**Definition:** Separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The retina loses its oxygen and nutrient supply from the choroidal circulation, leading to photoreceptor death and permanent vision loss if not reattached surgically.

**Types:**
- **Rhegmatogenous (most common, ~80-90%):** A full-thickness retinal break (tear or hole) allows liquefied vitreous to enter the subretinal space. Typically preceded by posterior vitreous detachment (PVD).
- **Tractional:** Fibrovascular membranes on the retinal surface contract and physically pull the retina off the RPE. Seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, prior vitreoretinal surgery, and penetrating trauma.
- **Exudative (serous):** Subretinal fluid accumulates without a retinal break or traction. Caused by inflammatory conditions (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, posterior scleritis), tumors (choroidal melanoma, metastases), vascular anomalies (Coats disease), or severe hypertension.

**Presentation:**
- Painless monocular visual field defect — classically described as a "curtain" or "shadow" coming down (or up, depending on detachment location)
- Flashes of light (photopsia) — caused by vitreoretinal traction stimulating the retina mechanically
- Sudden increase in floaters — pigmented cells (tobacco dust) or vitreous debris released by the tear
- Temporal sequence: floaters/flashes first (PVD with retinal tear), then progressive visual field loss (detachment spreading)
- Central vision preserved initially if macula is still attached (macula-on); profound central vision loss if macula detaches (macula-off)
- NO pain — pain suggests an alternative diagnosis

**Risk Factors:**
- High myopia (axial length >26 mm — thinner retina, more vitreous traction)
- Prior cataract surgery (aphakia/pseudophakia) — 1-3% lifetime risk of RRD post-phaco
- Fellow eye retinal detachment (10-15% lifetime risk in contralateral eye)
- Trauma (blunt or penetrating)
- Family history of retinal detachment
- Lattice degeneration (present in 6-8% of population; accounts for 30% of RRD)
- Prior vitreoretinal surgery
- Age >50 (increased PVD incidence)

**Exam Findings:**
- Visual acuity: variable — may be near-normal (macula-on, peripheral detachment) or severely reduced (macula-off)
- Confrontational visual field: field defect corresponding to the detachment location (superior detachment causes inferior field loss and vice versa)
- Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD): present only with extensive detachment
- Slit lamp: Shafer sign (tobacco dust) — brown pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, best seen with narrow bright beam through dilated pupil. Correlates with retinal tear in ~90% of cases. Vitreous hemorrhage (red cells) may also be present.
- Fundoscopy (dilated): elevated, undulating, gray-white retina; retinal tear may be visible as red break in pale detached retina. Loss of underlying choroidal pattern. Subretinal fluid.
- POCUS (bedside ocular ultrasound): hyperechoic membrane in the posterior chamber that undulates with eye movement ("flapping" retina). Distinguishable from PVD by the membrane being tethered at the optic disc. Sensitivity 91-97%, specificity 88-96% depending on operator experience.

**Macula Status — Determines Urgency:**
- **Macula-on:** Central vision preserved. Surgical emergency — repair within 24 hours to prevent macula involvement. Superotemporal detachments threaten the macula most rapidly due to gravity.
- **Macula-off:** Central vision already lost. Best outcomes with repair within 72 hours (recent macula-off), though repair is still beneficial even after longer delays.

## Critical Actions

1. **Determine macula status** — Is central vision preserved? Can the patient read with the affected eye? Macula-on status drives the urgency timeline. Document visual acuity in each eye.
2. **Perform bedside POCUS** if fundoscopy is limited (media opacity, undilated pupil, no ophthalmoscope) — high-frequency linear probe (7.5-10 MHz), gel on closed eyelid, look for hyperechoic membrane tethered to the optic disc.
3. **Emergent ophthalmology consultation** — Macula-on: within hours for same-day or next-morning surgery. Macula-off: urgent but not immediate (within 24-72 hours). If no retinal surgery capability, arrange emergent transfer.
4. **Position the patient** — Head positioning based on detachment location to use gravity to keep the macula attached. Superior detachment (most dangerous for macula): keep patient upright/sitting. Inferior detachment: supine is acceptable.
5. **Restrict activity** — Bed rest, avoid Valsalva maneuvers, straining, heavy lifting, coughing. Minimize eye movement. Bilateral eye patching is sometimes used to reduce saccades but evidence is limited and may increase patient anxiety.
6. **Do NOT dilate the eye if globe rupture is suspected** (traumatic mechanism). If no concern for globe rupture, dilated fundoscopy improves retinal visualization.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) | Flashes and floaters WITHOUT visual field defect. Most common cause of acute floaters (80-90% have PVD, not RD). No membrane on POCUS or membrane moves freely (not tethered to disc). Requires dilated fundoscopy to exclude retinal tear — 10-15% of acute PVD have concurrent retinal tear. |
| Vitreous hemorrhage | Sudden painless vision loss, "red haze" or dense floaters. Cannot visualize fundus through hemorrhage. POCUS shows mobile echogenic debris in vitreous cavity (swirling pattern) rather than a tethered membrane. Causes: diabetic retinopathy, retinal tear (may coexist with RD), trauma, retinal vein occlusion. |
| Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) | Sudden, painless, profound monocular vision loss (counting fingers or worse). RAPD present. Pale retina with cherry-red spot on fundoscopy. No flashes or floaters. No membrane on POCUS. Stroke equivalent — 30% risk of stroke/MI within 1 week. |
| Central/branch retinal vein occlusion | Painless vision loss (less acute onset). Dilated tortuous veins, widespread retinal hemorrhages ("blood and thunder" fundus), disc edema. No flashes or floaters. No detached membrane on POCUS. |
| Migraine with aura | Bilateral scintillating scotomata, fortification spectra. Resolves within 60 minutes. Normal exam between episodes. History of prior episodes. No visual field defect on confrontational testing after aura resolves. |
| Vitreous detachment with retinal tear (no detachment yet) | Flashes and floaters, Shafer sign positive, visible retinal tear on fundoscopy, but retina still attached. This is the precursor to RRD — requires urgent (not emergent) laser retinopexy or cryopexy to prevent detachment. |

## Workup

**Bedside (ED):**
- **Visual acuity** (each eye, with correction) — document carefully; determines macula-on vs macula-off and serves as baseline for surgical outcomes
- **Confrontational visual fields** — map the visual field defect; corresponds to detachment location
- **Pupillary exam** — RAPD suggests extensive detachment
- **Slit lamp examination** (anterior segment) — Shafer sign (tobacco dust/pigmented cells in anterior vitreous); vitreous hemorrhage (red cells); rule out anterior chamber pathology
- **Dilated fundoscopy** — gold standard; visualize retinal elevation, retinal tears, subretinal fluid. May be limited by vitreous hemorrhage or media opacity.
- **Intraocular pressure** — typically low-normal in the detached eye (reduced aqueous production by detached ciliary body; increased uveoscleral outflow). Markedly elevated IOP suggests alternative diagnosis (acute angle closure).
- **Point-of-care ocular ultrasound (POCUS)** — 7.5-10 MHz linear probe. Hyperechoic membrane in the posterior chamber tethered to the optic disc, undulating with eye movement. Sensitivity 91-97%, specificity 88-96%. Distinguishes from PVD (free-floating membrane not tethered to disc) and vitreous hemorrhage (swirling echogenic debris without membrane). Critical when fundoscopy is limited by media opacity.

**Laboratory:**
- No routine lab workup required for uncomplicated retinal detachment
- If traumatic: assess for associated injuries as indicated
- If exudative type suspected: inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), ANA, RPR/VDRL, ACE level, chest X-ray (sarcoidosis), directed workup based on suspected etiology

**Imaging:**
- CT orbit/head only if traumatic mechanism with concern for globe rupture, orbital fracture, or intracranial pathology
- MRI orbit with contrast if tumor-associated exudative detachment suspected (choroidal melanoma, metastatic disease)
- B-scan ultrasonography (formal, by ophthalmology) for detailed retinal evaluation when fundoscopy is inadequate

## Treatment

**There is no ED-specific pharmacologic or procedural treatment for retinal detachment.** Surgery is definitive. The ED role is recognition, stabilization, and arranging emergent ophthalmology intervention.

**ED Management:**
- **Head positioning:** Position patient so the detachment is dependent (gravity keeps subretinal fluid away from macula). Superior detachment: upright sitting. Inferior detachment: supine. If unsure of detachment location, keep patient supine with head slightly elevated.
- **Activity restriction:** Bed rest. Avoid Valsalva (no straining, heavy lifting, coughing). Stool softeners (docusate 100 mg PO) if constipation risk. Antiemetics (ondansetron 4 mg IV) if vomiting.
- **Bilateral patching:** Sometimes applied to reduce saccadic eye movements and prevent detachment progression. Evidence is weak. Use is at ophthalmology discretion.
- **Anxiolysis if needed:** Reduce agitation that could increase intraocular pressure.
- **Do NOT apply pressure to the globe.**

**Surgical Treatment (by ophthalmology — for ED awareness):**
- **Pneumatic retinopexy:** Office-based procedure; intravitreal gas bubble injection with cryopexy or laser to seal the retinal break. Appropriate for superior breaks, single breaks, and uncomplicated detachments. Strict postoperative head positioning required. Success rate ~75-80% with single procedure.
- **Scleral buckle:** Silicone band sutured to the sclera, indenting the eye wall to appose the RPE to the detached retina. Effective for uncomplicated RRD, especially in younger/phakic patients. Success rate ~85-90%.
- **Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV):** Vitreous removal, subretinal fluid drainage, endolaser, gas or silicone oil tamponade. Most versatile approach; used for complex, posterior, or multiple-break detachments, tractional RD, and combined procedures. Success rate ~90-95% for primary repair.
- **Laser retinopexy or cryopexy:** For retinal tears WITHOUT detachment (prophylactic, prevents RRD). Not a treatment for established detachment.

**For Exudative Detachment:**
- Treat the underlying cause (steroids for inflammatory, oncologic referral for tumor, blood pressure control for hypertensive)
- Surgery is generally not indicated

## Disposition

**Emergent Transfer/Consultation:**
- **Macula-on RRD:** Ophthalmology consultation within hours. Surgery ideally within 24 hours. If no retinal surgery capability at the presenting facility, arrange emergent transfer. Superotemporal macula-on detachments are highest priority (macula threatened by gravity).
- **Macula-off RRD (recent, < 7 days):** Urgent ophthalmology consultation. Best outcomes with repair within 72 hours. Transfer to retinal surgery center if needed but less time-critical than macula-on.
- **Macula-off RRD (chronic, > 7 days):** Ophthalmology consultation within 24-48 hours. Still benefits from surgical repair but not emergent. Can be discharged with confirmed urgent ophthalmology follow-up.

**Admission:**
- Not typically admitted for isolated retinal detachment
- Admit if: bilateral detachment, associated trauma requiring inpatient management, inability to maintain positioning, or need for emergent surgery at the presenting facility

**Discharge (with ophthalmology coordination):**
- Activity restrictions (no heavy lifting, straining, Valsalva)
- Head positioning instructions (detachment-dependent)
- Strict return precautions: worsening visual field defect, new loss of central vision, new flashes or floaters in either eye
- Confirmed ophthalmology appointment (timing based on macula status)
- Educate on fellow-eye risk (10-15% lifetime risk of RD in the contralateral eye)

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing flashes and floaters as benign PVD without dilated fundoscopy.** Acute flashes and floaters are PVD 85% of the time, but 10-15% of acute PVD patients have a concurrent retinal tear or detachment. Every patient with new-onset flashes and floaters needs dilated fundoscopy or POCUS in the ED, with ophthalmology follow-up within 24-48 hours for a complete retinal exam. Sending a patient home with "floaters are normal" without excluding retinal pathology is a high-liability disposition.

2. **Failing to determine macula-on vs macula-off status.** This is the single most important prognostic factor and determines surgical urgency. Macula-on detachments that progress to macula-off while awaiting surgery have significantly worse visual outcomes. Ask: "Can you read with this eye?" Check visual acuity carefully. Communicate macula status clearly to ophthalmology.

3. **Not using POCUS when fundoscopy is limited.** Vitreous hemorrhage, undilated pupil, or lack of an ophthalmoscope should not prevent diagnosis. Bedside ocular ultrasound has 91-97% sensitivity for retinal detachment and can be performed in minutes. The classic finding — a hyperechoic membrane tethered to the optic disc that undulates with eye movement — is distinct from PVD and vitreous hemorrhage.

4. **Confusing retinal detachment with posterior vitreous detachment on ultrasound.** PVD appears as a hyperechoic membrane that floats freely in the vitreous cavity and is NOT tethered to the optic disc. Retinal detachment membrane is tethered at the optic disc (the retina inserts at the disc and ora serrata). If the membrane connects to the disc, it is retinal detachment until proven otherwise.

5. **Not positioning the patient appropriately in the ED.** A patient with a superior macula-on detachment who is laid flat allows gravity to extend the subretinal fluid toward the macula. Keep patients with superior detachments upright. Ask ophthalmology about optimal positioning if uncertain.

6. **Attributing painless vision loss to CRAO without examining the fundus.** CRAO and retinal detachment both present with painless monocular vision loss, but the treatment timelines, urgency, and systemic implications differ dramatically. CRAO shows a pale retina with cherry-red spot and RAPD. Retinal detachment shows an elevated, undulating retina with subretinal fluid. POCUS easily distinguishes them. Misdiagnosis delays appropriate surgical referral.

7. **Missing bilateral pathology or fellow-eye risk.** Always examine both eyes. Bilateral simultaneous retinal detachment is rare but occurs (high myopia, Stickler syndrome, trauma). The fellow eye has a 10-15% lifetime risk of detachment. Dilated exam of the fellow eye identifies predisposing lesions (lattice degeneration, retinal holes) that can be treated prophylactically.

8. **Delayed transfer for macula-on detachments.** A macula-on detachment that becomes macula-off during transfer or overnight waiting loses central vision that may never fully recover, even after successful surgery. Macula-on status should trigger the same urgency as other time-sensitive ophthalmologic emergencies. Communicate clearly with the receiving facility: "macula-on retinal detachment, needs surgery within 24 hours."

9. **Failing to consider tractional or exudative detachment.** Not all retinal detachments are rhegmatogenous. A diabetic patient with proliferative retinopathy may have tractional detachment. A patient with inflammatory symptoms, hypertension, or known malignancy may have exudative detachment. The surgical approach differs — pneumatic retinopexy is contraindicated in tractional detachments. Communicate the suspected type to ophthalmology.
