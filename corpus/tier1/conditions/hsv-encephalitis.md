# Herpes Simplex Virus Encephalitis

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute necrotizing encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 in adults, HSV-2 in neonates). Most common cause of sporadic fatal encephalitis worldwide. Predilection for the temporal lobes.

**Classic Presentation:**
- Fever (90%)
- Altered mental status: confusion, disorientation, obtundation
- Seizures: focal or generalized (60-70%); temporal lobe seizures with olfactory/gustatory aura, automatisms
- Personality/behavioral changes: bizarre behavior, psychosis, agitation, aphasia (temporal lobe involvement)
- Headache (80%)
- Focal neurologic deficits: hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, visual field deficits

**Temporal Lobe Predilection:**
- HSV-1 enters the CNS via the olfactory or trigeminal nerve
- Necrotizing hemorrhagic inflammation predominantly affects the temporal lobes (medial and inferior), orbitofrontal cortex, insular cortex, and cingulate gyrus
- This localization produces the characteristic personality changes, memory deficits, aphasia, and olfactory hallucinations

**Epidemiology:**
- Incidence: 2-4 per 1,000,000/year
- Bimodal age distribution: < 20 years and > 50 years
- One-third of cases are primary HSV infection; two-thirds are reactivation
- No seasonal variation
- Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk but immunocompetent patients are commonly affected

**Neonatal HSV Encephalitis:**
- Presents at 1-4 weeks of life
- HSV-2 most common (vertical transmission during delivery)
- Irritability, lethargy, poor feeding, seizures, temperature instability
- Skin vesicles absent in ~40% of neonatal CNS disease — absence does NOT exclude diagnosis
- Three forms: skin-eyes-mouth (SEM), CNS disease, disseminated disease

## Critical Actions

1. **Start acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8h EMPIRICALLY on any encephalitis presentation.** Do NOT wait for CSF results, HSV PCR, imaging, or EEG. Mortality exceeds 70% without treatment. Start acyclovir if encephalitis is on the differential.
2. **Lumbar puncture** — obtain CSF for HSV PCR, cell count, protein, glucose, and bacterial cultures. Do not delay acyclovir for LP. If LP is delayed (CT needed first, coagulopathy), start acyclovir immediately and perform LP as soon as feasible.
3. **CT head before LP** — to rule out mass lesion/elevated ICP in patients with focal deficits, papilledema, altered consciousness, or immunocompromised state.
4. **MRI brain with diffusion-weighted imaging** — obtain urgently (more sensitive than CT for temporal lobe changes). MRI abnormalities may precede CSF positivity.
5. **Seizure management** — levetiracetam 20-30 mg/kg IV (max 3000 mg) or phenytoin/fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV. Temporal lobe seizures may be subtle (staring, lip-smacking, behavioral arrest).
6. **Neonatal HSV** — acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h. Higher dose than adults. Begin immediately if neonatal encephalitis is suspected regardless of vesicle presence.
7. **Consult infectious disease and neurology.**

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Bacterial meningitis | Nuchal rigidity prominent; CSF: neutrophilic pleocytosis, very low glucose, high protein, positive Gram stain/culture; no temporal lobe predilection |
| Autoimmune encephalitis (anti-NMDAR) | Young women; psychiatric symptoms, seizures, movement disorder, autonomic instability; CSF may show pleocytosis; MRI may be normal; anti-NMDA receptor antibodies |
| Brain abscess | Fever, focal deficits, headache; ring-enhancing lesion on CT/MRI; history of sinusitis, otitis, endocarditis, or immunosuppression |
| Temporal lobe epilepsy | Seizures without fever; no CSF pleocytosis; MRI shows mesial temporal sclerosis (chronic), not acute edema |
| CNS lymphoma | Immunocompromised (HIV); ring-enhancing periventricular lesions; subacute presentation; CSF cytology |
| Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) | Post-infectious/post-vaccination; multifocal white matter lesions; children > adults; monophasic |
| Other viral encephalitides (VZV, CMV, EBV, enterovirus, arbovirus) | VZV: dermatomal rash, immunocompromised; arboviruses: seasonal/geographic exposure; CMV: immunocompromised |
| Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis | Headache, seizures, focal deficits; MRI/MRV shows venous thrombosis; risk factors: OCP, hypercoagulable state |

## Workup

**CSF Analysis (lumbar puncture):**
- Opening pressure: normal or mildly elevated (< 300 mmH2O)
- WBC: lymphocytic pleocytosis (10-500 cells/uL); early may show RBCs (hemorrhagic necrosis) or be normal
- Protein: elevated (60-700 mg/dL)
- Glucose: normal (distinguishes from bacterial meningitis and TB meningitis)
- HSV PCR: sensitivity 98%, specificity 94%. Gold standard for diagnosis.
  - Can be NEGATIVE in the first 72 hours of illness — if high clinical suspicion and initial PCR negative, repeat LP at 3-7 days
  - Also can be negative late in disease course (after 10-14 days)
- Gram stain and bacterial culture: to exclude bacterial meningitis
- Additional CSF studies: VZV PCR, enterovirus PCR, arbovirus IgM (depending on season/geography), cytology, oligoclonal bands

**Imaging:**
- CT head: may show hypodensity in temporal lobes; often normal in first 3-5 days. Primary utility is to exclude mass lesion before LP.
- MRI brain (more sensitive than CT): T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in medial temporal lobes (often unilateral initially, becomes bilateral), insular cortex, orbitofrontal cortex. Diffusion restriction present. Petechial hemorrhage on gradient echo sequences. MRI is abnormal in >90% of cases by day 3.

**EEG:**
- Periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) — characteristic but not pathognomonic; seen in 80% of biopsy-proven cases
- Temporal lobe slowing or sharp waves
- Nonconvulsive status epilepticus should be excluded in patients with persistent altered mental status

**Labs:**
- CBC with differential
- BMP (acyclovir nephrotoxicity monitoring — creatinine at baseline and q48h)
- Hepatic function panel
- Coagulation studies (before LP)
- Blood cultures (exclude bacteremia)
- HIV test (consider in all encephalitis patients)

## Treatment

**Antiviral Therapy — Adults:**
- Acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8h (based on ideal body weight)
- Infuse each dose over 1 hour (rapid infusion causes crystalline nephropathy)
- Duration: 14-21 days of IV therapy
- Hydrate aggressively: IV NS at 100-150 mL/hr during acyclovir infusion to prevent nephrotoxicity
- Monitor renal function: BMP q48h. Dose-adjust for renal impairment (CrCl 25-50: 10 mg/kg q12h; CrCl 10-25: 10 mg/kg q24h)
- Repeat CSF HSV PCR near end of treatment course; if still positive, extend treatment

**Antiviral Therapy — Neonates:**
- Acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h
- Duration: 21 days for CNS disease and disseminated disease; 14 days for SEM disease
- Follow with oral acyclovir suppression: 300 mg/m2/dose PO TID for 6 months after IV course (reduces neurologic recurrence)

**Seizure Management:**
- Levetiracetam 20-30 mg/kg IV load (max 3000 mg), then 500-1500 mg IV/PO q12h
- Fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV load if needed, infuse at 150 mg PE/min; maintenance 5 mg PE/kg/day
- Benzodiazepines for acute seizure termination: lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg), repeat once at 5 minutes if seizure persists
- Continuous EEG monitoring for refractory seizures or persistent encephalopathy

**Elevated ICP Management (if present):**
- Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees
- Mannitol 1 g/kg IV bolus or hypertonic saline 23.4% 30 mL IV via central line
- Decompressive craniectomy: consult neurosurgery for refractory cerebral edema with herniation
- Corticosteroids: role controversial in HSV encephalitis; dexamethasone 10 mg IV q6h may be used as a bridge to definitive ICP management but not standard practice

**Supportive Care:**
- ICU admission for GCS <= 12, intubation, status epilepticus, or hemodynamic instability
- Temperature management: acetaminophen 1000 mg IV/PO q6h; external cooling for refractory fever
- DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily once seizures controlled and no hemorrhagic transformation on imaging
- Early nutrition: enteral preferred over parenteral

## Disposition

**All patients with suspected HSV encephalitis require admission.**

**ICU Admission:**
- GCS <= 12 or declining
- Status epilepticus or recurrent seizures
- Requirement for intubation/mechanical ventilation
- Significant cerebral edema or mass effect on imaging
- Hemodynamic instability

**Step-Down/Floor Admission:**
- Mild encephalopathy (GCS 13-15) with stable neurologic exam
- Seizures controlled on antiepileptic medication
- Stable vital signs
- Requires completion of 14-21 day IV acyclovir course

**Prognosis and Counseling:**
- Mortality with acyclovir: ~20% (vs. >70% untreated)
- Significant morbidity in survivors: memory impairment (anterograde and retrograde), personality changes, aphasia, seizure disorder (~50%)
- Younger age and lower GCS at presentation predict worse outcomes
- Early treatment (within 48 hours of symptom onset) significantly improves outcomes

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for HSV PCR results before starting acyclovir.** HSV PCR takes hours to days. Mortality increases with every hour of delay. Start acyclovir empirically on ANY encephalitis presentation. There is no clinical scenario where waiting for confirmatory testing before acyclovir is justified.

2. **Accepting a negative HSV PCR in the first 72 hours as definitive.** HSV PCR sensitivity is 98% overall but can be falsely negative early in the disease course. If clinical suspicion remains high (temporal lobe findings, CSF pleocytosis, compatible MRI), continue acyclovir and repeat LP at 3-7 days.

3. **Stopping acyclovir after a negative CT head.** CT is insensitive for early HSV encephalitis. CT is normal in up to 50% of cases in the first 3-5 days. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, and even MRI can be normal within the first 48 hours.

4. **Attributing psychiatric symptoms to a primary psychiatric disorder.** HSV encephalitis frequently presents with bizarre behavior, psychosis, personality change, and agitation due to temporal/frontal lobe involvement. Any acute psychiatric presentation with fever or CSF pleocytosis requires encephalitis workup.

5. **Failing to consider neonatal HSV in a febrile neonate without vesicles.** Skin vesicles are absent in ~40% of neonatal CNS HSV disease. Any neonate (age 1-28 days) with fever, seizures, lethargy, or CSF pleocytosis must receive acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h empirically.

6. **Underdosing acyclovir.** The dose is 10 mg/kg IV q8h in adults (20 mg/kg in neonates), based on ideal body weight. Subtherapeutic dosing (e.g., using oral valacyclovir instead of IV acyclovir) leads to treatment failure. Oral antivirals are NOT appropriate for HSV encephalitis treatment.

7. **Not monitoring renal function during acyclovir therapy.** Acyclovir causes crystalline nephropathy, especially with rapid infusion, inadequate hydration, or pre-existing renal disease. Check creatinine at baseline and q48h. Infuse over 1 hour with concurrent IV hydration.

8. **Missing nonconvulsive status epilepticus.** Persistent encephalopathy despite antiviral therapy may represent nonconvulsive seizures. Continuous EEG monitoring is indicated in any patient whose mental status does not improve as expected.

9. **Confusing HSV encephalitis with autoimmune encephalitis.** Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis presents similarly (young patient, psychiatric symptoms, seizures). Some cases of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis are triggered by preceding HSV encephalitis. Obtain NMDA receptor antibodies in any encephalitis patient not improving on acyclovir.

10. **Premature treatment discontinuation.** The standard IV acyclovir course is 14-21 days. Stopping at 7-10 days risks relapse. Repeat CSF HSV PCR near end of therapy; if still positive, extend treatment.
