# Kawasaki Disease

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute, self-limited vasculitis of unknown etiology affecting medium-sized arteries, predominantly coronary arteries, in children. Peak age 6 months to 5 years. Leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed countries.

**Classic (Complete) Kawasaki Disease — Fever ≥ 5 days PLUS ≥ 4 of 5 criteria:**
1. Bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection — nonexudative, limbus-sparing
2. Oral mucous membrane changes — strawberry tongue, lip erythema/cracking/fissuring, oropharyngeal erythema
3. Extremity changes — acute: erythema/edema of palms and soles; subacute (weeks 2-3): periungual desquamation
4. Polymorphous rash — maculopapular, diffuse erythroderma, or erythema multiforme-like; NEVER vesicular or bullous
5. Cervical lymphadenopathy — ≥ 1.5 cm, usually unilateral, non-fluctuant

**Incomplete (Atypical) Kawasaki Disease:**
- Fever ≥ 5 days + 2-3 classic criteria
- More common in infants < 6 months and children > 5 years
- These patients are at HIGHER risk for coronary aneurysms because of diagnostic delay
- AHA algorithm: if CRP ≥ 3 mg/dL or ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr AND ≥ 3 supplemental lab criteria (albumin ≤ 3 g/dL, anemia for age, elevated ALT, platelets > 450,000 after day 7, WBC ≥ 15,000, urine WBC ≥ 10/HPF), treat as Kawasaki disease

**Epidemiology:**
- Peak age: 6-12 months to 5 years (80% of cases < 5 years)
- Male:female ratio 1.5:1
- Higher incidence in Asian/Pacific Islander children (Japan: 300/100,000 < 5 years; US: 20/100,000 < 5 years)
- Seasonal peaks: winter/spring
- Recurrence rate: 3-4%

**Coronary Artery Aneurysm Risk:**
- 25% if untreated
- < 5% with timely IVIG treatment
- Giant aneurysms (> 8 mm) carry risk of thrombosis, stenosis, MI

## Critical Actions

1. **Do not wait for all 5 criteria to initiate treatment.** Incomplete Kawasaki disease is common. Fever ≥ 5 days with 2-3 classic features and elevated inflammatory markers warrants treatment.
2. **IVIG 2 g/kg IV (single infusion)** over 10-12 hours. Administer as soon as diagnosis is made. Treatment within 10 days of fever onset reduces coronary aneurysm risk from 25% to < 5%.
3. **Aspirin 30-50 mg/kg/day PO divided q6h** (high-dose anti-inflammatory; US/AHA convention uses 80-100 mg/kg/day — both regimens are evidence-based with similar outcomes; follow institutional protocol) during acute febrile phase until afebrile for 48-72 hours.
4. **Then aspirin 3-5 mg/kg/day PO once daily** (low-dose antiplatelet) for 6-8 weeks or until ESR and platelets normalize (longer if coronary abnormalities present).
5. **Echocardiogram at diagnosis** — baseline coronary artery assessment. Repeat at 2 weeks and 6-8 weeks.
6. **Admit all patients** — for IVIG infusion and cardiac monitoring.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Scarlet fever | GAS pharyngitis, sandpaper rash, responds to antibiotics within 24-48 hours, positive rapid strep/culture |
| Measles | Cough, coryza, conjunctivitis (exudative unlike KD), Koplik spots, cephalocaudal rash spread, unvaccinated |
| Adenovirus infection | Exudative pharyngitis and conjunctivitis (KD is nonexudative), respiratory symptoms predominate |
| Stevens-Johnson syndrome | Drug exposure, targetoid lesions, mucosal erosion (not just erythema), skin sloughing |
| Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (systemic) | Quotidian fever pattern (daily spikes), salmon-pink evanescent rash, arthritis, hepatosplenomegaly |
| Toxic shock syndrome | Hypotension, desquamation of palms/soles (later), positive staphylococcal/streptococcal cultures, multiorgan dysfunction |
| Reactive arthritis | Post-infectious, joint predominant, conjunctivitis, urethritis (older children), HLA-B27 association |
| Mercury poisoning (acrodynia) | Pink discoloration of hands/feet, irritability, hypertension, mercury exposure history |
| Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) | Recent SARS-CoV-2 infection/exposure, shock/hypotension more common, older age, GI symptoms prominent, SARS-CoV-2 serology positive |

## Workup

**Laboratory Studies:**
- CBC: leukocytosis with left shift (WBC ≥ 15,000 supports diagnosis), thrombocytosis (platelets > 450,000, typically peaks weeks 2-3), normocytic anemia
- CRP and ESR: elevated (CRP ≥ 3 mg/dL, ESR ≥ 40 mm/hr)
- CMP: hypoalbuminemia (≤ 3 g/dL), elevated ALT, hyponatremia
- Urinalysis: sterile pyuria (WBC ≥ 10/HPF from urethral inflammation, urine culture negative)
- Blood culture (to exclude bacteremia/sepsis)
- Lipid panel (baseline; coronary risk factor)
- Procalcitonin (may help distinguish from bacterial infection)

**Cardiac Evaluation:**
- Echocardiogram at diagnosis: coronary artery dimensions (z-scores), left ventricular function, valvular regurgitation, pericardial effusion
- 12-lead ECG: arrhythmia, ST changes, prolonged PR interval (common in acute KD)

**Additional Studies (if diagnosis uncertain):**
- Throat culture/rapid strep (exclude GAS)
- Viral panel (exclude adenovirus, measles, EBV)
- SARS-CoV-2 PCR and serology (exclude MIS-C)
- Procalcitonin

## Treatment

**First-Line Therapy:**
- IVIG 2 g/kg IV as a single infusion over 10-12 hours
- Administer through large-bore IV or central line (high osmolarity)
- Monitor for infusion reactions: fever, chills, hypotension, anaphylaxis. Slow rate if reaction occurs; epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg IM (max 0.5 mg) for anaphylaxis.
- Aspirin 30-50 mg/kg/day PO divided q6h during acute phase (anti-inflammatory dose)
- After afebrile 48-72 hours: reduce to aspirin 3-5 mg/kg/day PO once daily for 6-8 weeks

**IVIG Non-Responders (persistent or recrudescent fever > 36 hours after completing IVIG):**
- Second dose IVIG 2 g/kg IV over 10-12 hours
- If refractory after second IVIG:
  - Infliximab 5 mg/kg IV (single dose) — screen for TB before administration if time allows
  - Methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV daily (max 1 g) for 3 days, then oral prednisolone taper over 2-3 weeks
  - Cyclosporine 3-5 mg/kg/day PO divided BID (refractory cases, pediatric rheumatology consult)

**Coronary Artery Aneurysm Management:**
- Small aneurysm (z-score 2.5-5): aspirin 3-5 mg/kg/day
- Medium aneurysm (z-score 5-10): aspirin + clopidogrel 1 mg/kg/day (max 75 mg)
- Giant aneurysm (z-score ≥ 10 or ≥ 8 mm): aspirin + warfarin (INR 2-3) or LMWH, cardiology-directed

**Vaccine Considerations:**
- Defer MMR and varicella vaccines for 11 months after IVIG (IVIG antibodies interfere with live vaccine immunogenicity)
- Influenza and other inactivated vaccines can be given on schedule

## Disposition

**Admission (all patients):**
- IVIG infusion requires inpatient monitoring (infusion reactions, cardiac monitoring)
- Monitor temperature q4h — defervescence expected within 36 hours of IVIG completion
- Repeat echocardiogram before discharge if any baseline coronary abnormality

**ICU Admission:**
- Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (hypotension, poor perfusion)
- Coronary artery thrombosis or acute MI
- Severe myocarditis with heart failure
- Macrophage activation syndrome (rare complication: pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, coagulopathy)

**Discharge Criteria:**
- Afebrile ≥ 24 hours after IVIG completion
- Tolerating oral aspirin
- Baseline echocardiogram obtained
- Follow-up arranged: pediatric cardiology within 2 weeks, repeat echocardiogram at 2 weeks and 6-8 weeks
- Parents educated on Reye syndrome risk (avoid ibuprofen for fever while on aspirin; if influenza or varicella exposure, contact physician regarding aspirin management)

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing incomplete Kawasaki disease in infants < 6 months.** Infants < 6 months are less likely to meet classic criteria and more likely to develop coronary aneurysms. Any infant with prolonged unexplained fever (≥ 5 days) and elevated inflammatory markers should be evaluated for incomplete KD with echocardiogram, even with fewer than 4 classic features.

2. **Waiting for all 5 classic criteria before treating.** Experienced clinicians diagnose Kawasaki disease with fever ≥ 5 days and 4 of 5 criteria, but incomplete KD (2-3 criteria) is common. AHA guidelines provide a supplemental laboratory algorithm to guide treatment decisions in incomplete cases. Delayed treatment beyond day 10 of illness dramatically increases coronary aneurysm risk.

3. **Diagnosing viral illness and discharging without considering KD.** The classic KD features (conjunctivitis, rash, oral changes, lymphadenopathy) overlap with common viral illnesses (adenovirus, measles, EBV). Persistent fever ≥ 5 days despite antibiotics or lack of identified viral etiology should raise suspicion for KD. A child who "keeps coming back with fever" is a red flag.

4. **Not obtaining an echocardiogram at diagnosis.** Baseline echocardiogram is essential to detect existing coronary artery dilation and establish reference dimensions for follow-up. Coronary abnormalities may be present at the time of initial diagnosis (especially with delayed presentation). Treatment decisions for aneurysm management depend on baseline imaging.

5. **Giving IVIG before day 5 of illness.** IVIG administered before day 5 of fever is associated with a higher rate of IVIG resistance and the need for retreatment. The optimal window is days 5-10 of illness. However, do not delay beyond day 10 — the treatment window for preventing coronary complications closes rapidly.

6. **Forgetting to defer live vaccines after IVIG.** IVIG contains antibodies that neutralize live vaccine antigens (MMR, varicella). Administering these vaccines within 11 months of IVIG leads to vaccine failure. Document the IVIG date and communicate to the primary care provider to reschedule live vaccines.

7. **Assuming normal echocardiogram means no follow-up needed.** Coronary artery aneurysms can develop or progress weeks after the acute illness, even with IVIG treatment. AHA guidelines require repeat echocardiogram at 2 weeks and 6-8 weeks. Patients with coronary abnormalities need long-term cardiology follow-up extending into adulthood.

8. **Not recognizing Kawasaki disease shock syndrome.** A subset of KD patients present with hemodynamic instability mimicking septic shock or toxic shock syndrome. These patients have higher rates of IVIG resistance and coronary aneurysms. If a febrile child with mucocutaneous features is hypotensive and not responding to antibiotics, add KD to the differential and initiate IVIG.

9. **Failing to warn parents about Reye syndrome risk while on aspirin therapy.** Children on long-term low-dose aspirin are at risk for Reye syndrome with influenza or varicella infection. Parents must be counseled to contact their physician immediately if the child is exposed to or develops influenza or varicella. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended for the child and household contacts.
