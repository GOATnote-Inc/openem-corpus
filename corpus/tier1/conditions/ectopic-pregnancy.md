# Ectopic Pregnancy

## Recognition

**Definition:** Implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterine cavity. 95% are tubal (ampullary > isthmic > fimbrial > interstitial). Non-tubal: ovarian, cervical, cesarean scar, abdominal, heterotopic.

**Incidence:** 1-2% of all pregnancies. Leading cause of maternal death in the first trimester.

**Risk Factors:**
- Prior ectopic pregnancy (10-25% recurrence)
- Tubal surgery or ligation (especially electrocautery)
- Pelvic inflammatory disease / STI history
- IUD in situ (does not increase absolute risk, but if pregnancy occurs with IUD, 50% are ectopic)
- In vitro fertilization (2-5% ectopic, 1% heterotopic)
- Smoking
- Age > 35
- Endometriosis
- DES exposure

**Presentation:**
- Amenorrhea or missed period (75%)
- Vaginal bleeding (typically light, dark blood) (80%)
- Unilateral pelvic/abdominal pain (90%)
- Asymptomatic (detected on routine early US — increasingly common)

**Ruptured Ectopic — Surgical Emergency:**
- Sudden severe abdominal pain
- Peritoneal signs (guarding, rebound, rigidity)
- Hypotension, tachycardia (hemorrhagic shock)
- Shoulder pain (diaphragmatic irritation from hemoperitoneum)
- Syncope or near-syncope
- Vaginal bleeding (may be minimal despite massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage)

**Exam Findings:**
- Adnexal tenderness (unilateral)
- Adnexal mass (palpable in < 50%)
- Cervical motion tenderness
- Uterine size less than expected for dates
- Cul-de-sac fullness (hemoperitoneum)

## Critical Actions

1. **Quantitative beta-hCG** — on every reproductive-age female with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or syncope. Even if "not sexually active" or "tubes tied."
2. **Type and screen / crossmatch** — all patients with suspected ectopic. Type and crossmatch if hemodynamically unstable.
3. **RhD status** — administer RhoGAM 300 mcg IM (or 50 mcg MICRhoGAM if < 12 weeks) to all Rh-negative patients with bleeding.
4. **Transvaginal ultrasound** — first-line imaging. Identifies intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) which effectively excludes ectopic (heterotopic is 1:30,000 in natural conception, up to 1:100 in IVF).
5. **If ruptured/unstable** — emergent OB/GYN surgical consultation, massive transfusion protocol, operative management. Do NOT delay for imaging in a hemodynamically unstable patient with a positive pregnancy test.
6. **Two large-bore IVs** — crystalloid resuscitation for hemodynamic instability, blood products early.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Threatened/incomplete miscarriage | IUP on ultrasound, open os, tissue at os |
| Corpus luteum cyst rupture | Can mimic ruptured ectopic exactly; TVUS shows IUP + free fluid; hemoperitoneum usually self-limited |
| Ovarian torsion | Sudden onset unilateral pain, nausea/vomiting, enlarged ovary with absent Doppler flow |
| Appendicitis | RLQ pain, periumbilical onset, negative pregnancy test, inflammatory markers elevated |
| PID/tubo-ovarian abscess | Bilateral pain, cervical motion tenderness, discharge, fever, negative pregnancy test or IUP present |
| Ovarian cyst (hemorrhagic) | Unilateral pain, TVUS diagnostic, negative or positive pregnancy test (independent finding) |
| Heterotopic pregnancy | IUP + concurrent ectopic; suspect in IVF patients. IUP on ultrasound does NOT exclude ectopic in IVF. |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- Quantitative beta-hCG (serum):
  - Discriminatory zone: 1,500-3,000 mIU/mL (transvaginal US should visualize an IUP above this level)
  - If hCG above discriminatory zone and no IUP on TVUS: ectopic until proven otherwise
  - If hCG below discriminatory zone: pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). Serial hCG in 48 hours (normal IUP rises > 53% in 48h; slower rise or plateau suggests ectopic or nonviable IUP)
  - Falling hCG does not exclude ectopic (ruptured ectopics can have falling hCG)
- CBC — hemoglobin baseline, serial if bleeding
- Type and screen / crossmatch
- BMP
- Coagulation studies (if significant hemorrhage)
- Rh type

**Imaging:**
- **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS):** First-line. Findings:
  - Definitive IUP: gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole within uterus (excludes ectopic in natural conception)
  - Ectopic: extrauterine gestational sac with yolk sac or embryo (definitive)
  - Tubal ring sign: hyperechoic ring in adnexa separate from ovary
  - Complex adnexal mass (most common finding)
  - Free fluid in cul-de-sac (echogenic = hemoperitoneum)
  - Pseudosac: fluid collection within uterus without double decidual sign (do NOT confuse with IUP)
  - Empty uterus with hCG above discriminatory zone = ectopic until proven otherwise

- **POCUS (emergency physician bedside):**
  - IUP identification is the primary goal (IUP essentially excludes ectopic in natural conception)
  - Free fluid in Morison's pouch or pelvis in a pregnant, unstable patient = ruptured ectopic, go to OR

## Treatment

**Hemodynamically Unstable / Ruptured Ectopic:**
- ABCs, 2 large-bore IVs, crystalloid resuscitation
- Activate massive transfusion protocol
- Emergent OB/GYN consultation for operative management
- **Salpingectomy** (laparoscopic preferred if patient tolerates, open/laparotomy if unstable or massive hemoperitoneum)
- Do NOT delay surgery for formal radiology US. Bedside POCUS + positive hCG + shock = OR.
- Tranexamic acid 1g IV over 10 min (extrapolated from trauma data, consider for hemorrhage control)

**Hemodynamically Stable — Medical Management (Methotrexate):**

Criteria for methotrexate (all must be met):
- Hemodynamically stable
- Unruptured
- No fetal cardiac activity
- hCG < 5,000 mIU/mL (best outcomes)
- Ectopic mass < 3.5 cm
- No contraindications to methotrexate (hepatic/renal disease, immunodeficiency, breastfeeding, PUD, blood dyscrasias)
- Patient able to comply with follow-up

**Methotrexate Protocols:**
- Single-dose: Methotrexate 50 mg/m2 IM (Day 1). Recheck hCG Day 4 and Day 7. If < 15% decline between Day 4 and Day 7, give second dose. Follow weekly hCG until < 5 mIU/mL.
- Multi-dose: Methotrexate 1 mg/kg IM on Days 1, 3, 5, 7 alternating with leucovorin 0.1 mg/kg IM on Days 2, 4, 6, 8. Stop when hCG declines > 15% between measurements.

**Pre-methotrexate labs:** CBC, BMP (creatinine), LFTs, blood type, hCG.

**Hemodynamically Stable — Surgical Management:**
- Indications: failed methotrexate, contraindication to methotrexate, fetal cardiac activity, hCG > 5,000, patient preference, heterotopic pregnancy, non-tubal ectopic
- **Salpingectomy** (preferred unless fertility-preserving indicated) vs. **salpingotomy** (if contralateral tube absent/damaged)
- Laparoscopic approach preferred

**Expectant Management:**
- Select cases only: hCG < 200 mIU/mL and declining, asymptomatic, reliable follow-up
- Serial hCG q48-72h until < 5 mIU/mL
- Patient must understand risk of rupture and need for immediate return if pain/bleeding

**Rh-Negative Patients:**
- RhoGAM 300 mcg IM (or 50 mcg MICRhoGAM if < 12 weeks) for ALL Rh-negative patients regardless of management path

## Disposition

**Emergent OR:**
- Ruptured ectopic (hemodynamic instability, peritoneal signs, significant hemoperitoneum)

**Admission:**
- Post-surgical management
- Failed methotrexate with rising hCG
- Persistent pain or concern for impending rupture
- Hemodynamically labile but stabilized

**Discharge with Close Follow-Up (OB/GYN within 48-72 hours):**
- Stable patient receiving methotrexate
- Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) with hCG below discriminatory zone, serial monitoring planned
- Expectant management candidates
- Must have: reliable follow-up, understands ectopic precautions, proximity to surgical facility, prescribed return if severe pain/syncope/heavy bleeding

**Discharge Instructions Must Include:**
- Return immediately for: severe abdominal pain, dizziness/fainting, heavy vaginal bleeding, shoulder pain
- Avoid intercourse, NSAIDs (if on methotrexate), folate supplements, and alcohol during methotrexate treatment
- Follow-up hCG schedule

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to check a pregnancy test.** Every reproductive-age female (roughly 12-55) with abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, syncope, or hypotension needs a pregnancy test. Ectopic pregnancy occurs after tubal ligation, with IUDs, and in patients who report no sexual activity. The test takes 3 minutes and the miss kills.

2. **Assuming an IUP excludes ectopic in IVF patients.** Heterotopic pregnancy (simultaneous IUP + ectopic) occurs in up to 1:100 in assisted reproduction, compared to 1:30,000 in natural conception. Always evaluate the adnexa in IVF patients regardless of IUP status.

3. **Using the discriminatory zone as a definitive rule-out.** A single hCG below the discriminatory zone does not exclude ectopic. Ruptured ectopics have been reported at hCG levels as low as 10-100 mIU/mL. The discriminatory zone guides ultrasound interpretation, not clinical decision-making.

4. **Confusing a pseudosac with an IUP.** A pseudosac (decidual reaction to ectopic pregnancy hormones) appears as a small intrauterine fluid collection without a double decidual sign, yolk sac, or fetal pole. Misidentifying this as an IUP delays ectopic diagnosis. A true IUP has a yolk sac or embryo.

5. **Dismissing a stable patient as low-risk.** Ectopic pregnancies rupture without warning. Patients who are hemodynamically stable in the ED can rupture hours later. Clear return precautions, reliable follow-up, and understanding of warning signs are mandatory.

6. **Anchoring on declining hCG.** A falling hCG does not eliminate rupture risk. Ectopic pregnancies can rupture while hCG is declining, including after methotrexate treatment. Pain in a patient with known ectopic and declining hCG still requires urgent evaluation.

7. **Forgetting RhoGAM in Rh-negative patients.** Fetomaternal hemorrhage causes Rh sensitization even in early pregnancy. Failure to administer RhoGAM jeopardizes all future pregnancies. Administer to every Rh-negative patient with ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion.
