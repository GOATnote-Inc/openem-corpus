# Acute Urinary Retention

## Recognition

**Definition:** Sudden inability to voluntarily void despite a full bladder. Characterized by painful bladder distension requiring emergent drainage. Distinct from chronic urinary retention, which is painless and associated with large residual volumes.

**Etiology:**

*Obstructive (most common):*
- Benign prostatic hyperplasia (most common cause in men > 60)
- Prostate cancer
- Urethral stricture
- Phimosis/paraphimosis
- Bladder neck contracture
- Blood clots (clot retention post-procedure or from hematuria)
- Foreign body
- Pelvic mass (uterine fibroids, ovarian cyst) compressing bladder outlet
- Fecal impaction

*Pharmacologic:*
- Anticholinergics (antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, cyclobenzaprine)
- Sympathomimetics (pseudoephedrine, phenylephrine — increase bladder outlet resistance)
- Opioids (decrease detrusor contractility)
- Anesthetic agents (spinal/epidural anesthesia)
- Calcium channel blockers
- NSAIDs (rare)

*Neurogenic:*
- Cauda equina syndrome
- Spinal cord compression
- Multiple sclerosis
- Diabetic autonomic neuropathy
- Stroke
- Epidural abscess

*Infectious/Inflammatory:*
- Acute prostatitis
- Urethritis
- Herpes simplex (sacral radiculitis)

**Presentation:**
- Suprapubic pain and fullness (acute, often severe)
- Inability to void or voiding only small dribbles
- Palpable/percussable distended bladder (above pubic symphysis)
- Restlessness, agitation
- Overflow incontinence (dribbling despite retention)
- Autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury patients above T6 (hypertension, bradycardia, headache, flushing — medical emergency)

## Critical Actions

1. **Urethral catheterization** — Foley catheter (14-16 Fr) is definitive treatment. Decompress the bladder promptly. Measure post-void residual (PVR) — AUR typically > 300-500 mL.
2. **If urethral catheterization fails** — do NOT force the catheter. Attempt coude-tip catheter (curved tip, useful for prostatic obstruction). If still unsuccessful, consult urology for suprapubic catheter placement.
3. **Evaluate for cauda equina syndrome** — new urinary retention + back pain + saddle anesthesia + lower extremity weakness/bowel dysfunction = surgical emergency. MRI spine STAT.
4. **Review medication list** — identify and discontinue offending agents (anticholinergics, opioids, sympathomimetics).
5. **Obtain post-catheterization labs** — BMP (creatinine, potassium) to evaluate for obstructive nephropathy. Urinalysis to assess for infection.
6. **Monitor for post-obstructive diuresis** — after decompression of severely distended bladders (> 1000 mL), a physiologic and sometimes pathologic diuresis occurs. Monitor urine output, electrolytes, and volume status.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Cauda equina syndrome | Back pain, saddle anesthesia, bilateral lower extremity weakness, absent ankle reflexes, bowel dysfunction |
| Bladder rupture | Trauma history, suprapubic tenderness, inability to void, CT cystogram diagnostic |
| Urinary tract infection/cystitis | Dysuria, frequency, urgency — but can still void (unless prostatitis/severe inflammation) |
| Anuria (renal failure) | No urine produced; bladder scan shows empty bladder; elevated creatinine |
| Pelvic mass/tumor | Gradually progressive symptoms, pelvic exam/imaging reveals mass |
| Neurogenic bladder (chronic) | Chronic large residuals, painless, known neurologic condition |
| Paraphimosis | Retracted foreskin trapped behind glans, penile edema and pain |
| Acute prostatitis | Fever, perineal pain, exquisitely tender prostate on DRE, pyuria |

## Workup

**Bedside:**
- Bladder scan (PVR) — > 300-500 mL confirms retention; > 1000 mL indicates severe distension
- Abdominal exam (palpable bladder)
- Focused neurologic exam: lower extremity strength, patellar/ankle reflexes, perianal sensation, anal sphincter tone (cauda equina screening)
- Rectal exam: prostate size/tenderness, fecal impaction
- Genital exam: phimosis, paraphimosis, urethral meatal stenosis

**Labs:**
- Urinalysis with culture (UTI as precipitant)
- BMP (creatinine to evaluate for obstructive nephropathy; potassium — hyperkalemia from renal failure)
- CBC (if infection suspected)
- PSA: do NOT check in the ED acutely (will be elevated from retention and catheterization, not interpretable)

**Imaging:**
- Renal ultrasound: if elevated creatinine or concern for hydronephrosis/obstructive uropathy
- CT abdomen/pelvis: if pelvic mass suspected, hematuria workup, or complicated retention
- MRI spine: emergent if cauda equina syndrome suspected

## Treatment

**Bladder Decompression:**
- **Foley catheter insertion (14-16 Fr):**
  - Sterile technique
  - Adequate lubrication (lidocaine 2% jelly 10-20 mL instilled into urethra, wait 5 minutes for anesthetic effect)
  - In males: straighten the penile urethra by holding the penis perpendicular to the body, advance past the external sphincter with gentle steady pressure
  - Document volume drained (PVR)
  - Leave catheter to gravity drainage

- **If standard catheter fails:**
  - Coude-tip catheter (16-18 Fr) — curved tip navigates prostatic urethra
  - Larger catheter (18-20 Fr for clot retention — allows clot evacuation)
  - Do NOT use force — urethral trauma creates false passage

- **Suprapubic catheter:**
  - Placed by urology (or emergency physician if trained) when urethral catheterization impossible
  - Confirm distended bladder by ultrasound before placement
  - Contraindicated if prior lower abdominal surgery (bowel adhesions), coagulopathy, or empty bladder

**Rapid vs. Gradual Decompression:**
- Historical concern for hematuria and hypotension with rapid complete decompression is NOT supported by evidence
- Rapid complete decompression is safe and recommended — no need to clamp catheter intermittently

**Pharmacologic Adjuncts:**
- **Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO daily** — alpha-1 blocker, relaxes prostatic smooth muscle. Start immediately. Increases success of voiding trial (catheter removal) at 48-72 hours.
- **Finasteride 5 mg PO daily** — 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, reduces prostate size over months. Started by urology for long-term management.
- Treat acute prostatitis if present: ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole DS 1 tab PO BID for 4-6 weeks
- Discontinue offending medications when possible

**Post-Obstructive Diuresis:**
- Occurs after decompression of severely distended bladders
- Monitor urine output for 4-6 hours post-catheterization
- Pathologic post-obstructive diuresis: > 200 mL/hr for > 2 consecutive hours
- Replace 50-75% of hourly urine output with IV NS if pathologic diuresis with hemodynamic changes or electrolyte abnormalities
- Check BMP q6-12h during significant diuresis

**Clot Retention:**
- 3-way catheter (20-22 Fr) with continuous bladder irrigation (CBI) using NS
- Manual irrigation with 60 mL catheter-tip syringe to evacuate clots
- Urology consultation for persistent clot retention — may require cystoscopy with clot evacuation

## Disposition

**Discharge (majority of uncomplicated AUR):**
- Successful catheterization, clear urine, normal renal function
- Foley catheter to leg bag with instructions
- Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO daily started
- Urology follow-up within 48-72 hours for voiding trial (trial without catheter / TWOC)
- Instructions: leg bag care, catheter management, return for fever/hematuria/catheter blockage/inability to drain
- Discontinue offending medications

**Observation / Admission:**
- Post-obstructive diuresis (high-output, > 200 mL/hr, electrolyte abnormalities)
- Obstructive uropathy with acute kidney injury (elevated creatinine, hyperkalemia, hydronephrosis)
- Urosepsis (fever, tachycardia, pyuria, bacteremia)
- Failed catheterization requiring suprapubic catheter
- Clot retention requiring continuous bladder irrigation and monitoring
- Cauda equina syndrome (neurosurgical emergency)
- Autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury patients

**ICU Admission:**
- Septic shock from obstructive uropathy
- Severe autonomic dysreflexia with hypertensive emergency
- Hyperkalemia with ECG changes from obstructive renal failure

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing cauda equina syndrome.** New urinary retention + back pain + saddle anesthesia = cauda equina until proven otherwise. A rectal exam (anal tone) and lower extremity neuro exam take 2 minutes and identify a surgical emergency. Delayed diagnosis causes permanent paralysis and incontinence.

2. **Forcing a catheter through resistance.** Forceful catheterization creates a false passage, urethral perforation, and bleeding — converting a simple retention into a urologic emergency. If the catheter does not pass with gentle pressure, attempt a coude-tip catheter. If that fails, call urology for suprapubic catheter.

3. **Not starting tamsulosin in the ED.** Alpha-blockers significantly increase the success rate of voiding trials (catheter removal) at 48-72 hours. Starting tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO in the ED (before discharge) reduces return visits and recurrent retention.

4. **Clamping the catheter for "gradual decompression."** The practice of intermittent catheter clamping to prevent post-decompression hematuria or hypotension is not supported by evidence. Rapid, complete bladder decompression is safe and recommended. Clamping prolongs patient discomfort and delays definitive treatment.

5. **Ignoring post-obstructive diuresis.** After draining a severely distended bladder (> 1000 mL), pathologic diuresis can cause hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hypokalemia. Monitor urine output for 4-6 hours post-catheterization. Patients producing > 200 mL/hr for 2+ consecutive hours require IV fluid replacement and electrolyte monitoring.

6. **Checking PSA in the acute setting.** PSA is elevated by urinary retention, catheterization, prostatitis, and rectal exam. A PSA drawn in the ED is uninterpretable and leads to unnecessary anxiety and workup. Defer PSA to urology follow-up at least 6 weeks after the acute event.

7. **Failing to review the medication list.** Anticholinergics, alpha-agonists (pseudoephedrine), and opioids are frequent precipitants of AUR. Identifying and discontinuing the offending agent may prevent recurrence. Over-the-counter cold medications are commonly overlooked.

8. **Not performing a rectal exam.** Fecal impaction causes AUR by mechanical compression of the urethra and bladder outlet. A rectal exam identifies impaction (easily treatable) and assesses prostate size and tenderness. Digital rectal exam is part of the standard AUR evaluation.
