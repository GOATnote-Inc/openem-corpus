# Traumatic Amputation

## Recognition

**Mechanism:** Industrial machinery, farm equipment, motor vehicle collision, power tools, crush injury, blast/explosion, assault with sharp weapon.

**Types:**
- **Complete amputation:** Part fully detached
- **Incomplete (near) amputation:** Part attached by skin bridge, tendon, or neurovascular pedicle only
- **Guillotine (clean cut):** Best prognosis for replantation
- **Crush/avulsion:** Worse prognosis — zone of injury extends beyond visible damage
- **Ring avulsion (degloving):** Classified by Urbaniak/Kay: Class I (adequate circulation), Class II (no arterial flow), Class III (complete degloving/amputation)

**Anatomic classification:**
- **Digits:** Most common. Thumb and multiple-digit amputations have strongest replantation indications.
- **Hand/Wrist:** Sharp mechanism at wrist = strong replantation candidate
- **Forearm/Arm:** Replantation possible at specialized centers
- **Lower extremity:** Replantation rarely attempted (functional outcomes poor compared to prosthetics)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Hemorrhage control | Immediate |
| Amputated part preservation | Immediate |
| Hand surgery / replantation consult | < 30 minutes |
| Transfer to replantation center | < 1 hour decision |

1. **Control hemorrhage:**
   - Direct pressure (first-line)
   - Tourniquet if pressure fails (apply proximal, note time)
   - Avoid clamping vessels blindly (damages vessel needed for reattachment)
2. **Preserve the amputated part:**
   - Wrap in saline-moistened sterile gauze
   - Place in watertight plastic bag or container
   - Place bag on ice/ice water mixture (NOT direct contact with ice — causes frostbite)
   - Target 4°C — extends ischemia tolerance dramatically
   - Cold ischemia tolerance: digits up to 12-24 hours (some report 30h), proximal amputations 6-12 hours
   - Warm ischemia tolerance: 4-6 hours max
   - **NEVER place part directly on ice, in water, or in dry ice**
3. **ATLS primary survey** — hemorrhagic shock common; resuscitate before focusing on part
4. **X-ray** both stump and amputated part (if available) — identifies fracture pattern, foreign bodies, joint involvement
5. **Tetanus prophylaxis:** Tdap 0.5 mL IM
6. **Antibiotics:** cefazolin 2 g IV q8h (add gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV if grossly contaminated)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Near (incomplete) amputation — may be replanted as revascularization rather than true replantation
- Degloving injury without skeletal loss
- Devascularized but intact extremity (vascular injury without amputation)
- Ring avulsion (Urbaniak classification guides management)
- Mangled extremity (combined injuries without complete separation)

## Workup

- **Hemorrhage assessment:** Serial vitals, CBC, type and crossmatch
- **X-ray:** Stump and amputated part — fracture pattern, distal joint viability, foreign bodies
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, type and crossmatch, CK (baseline), lactate
- **Neurovascular assessment of stump:** Sensation, motor function, Doppler pulses proximal to injury
- **Photography:** Document injury for replantation team if transferring

## Treatment

**Replantation indications (strong):**
- Thumb amputation (any level)
- Multiple digit amputations
- Amputations in children (any level — excellent nerve regeneration)
- Sharp/guillotine amputations at wrist or forearm
- Single digit distal to FDS insertion (Zone I) — preserves function
- Individual patient need (musician, manual laborer)

**Replantation contraindications:**
- Severe crush/avulsion mechanism (zone of injury too extensive)
- Multi-level injury (multiple levels of damage in same digit)
- Severely contaminated or prolonged warm ischemia (> 6 hours proximal, > 12 hours digits)
- Single digit proximal to FDS insertion (Zone II — poor functional outcome, stiffness)
- Life-threatening associated injuries
- Significant comorbidities precluding prolonged surgery (12+ hours)
- Patient preference (after informed discussion)

**Stump management (if no replantation):**
- Debridement of non-viable tissue
- Bone shortening to allow tension-free soft tissue closure
- Preserve maximum length (especially in lower extremity for prosthetic fitting)
- Drain and close primarily if clean; leave open and VAC if contaminated
- Nerve identification, ligation, and burial in soft tissue to prevent neuroma

**Pain management:**
- Digital nerve block (digital amputations): lidocaine 1% without epinephrine, 2-3 mL per side of digit
- Regional nerve block (proximal amputations): brachial plexus block with ropivacaine 0.5% 20-30 mL, or femoral/sciatic block
- Systemic: fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV q30min PRN, ketamine 0.1-0.3 mg/kg IV (analgesic dose)

**Wound care (stump):**
- Copious saline irrigation
- Non-adherent dressing, moist wound environment
- Antibiotics: cefazolin 2 g IV q8h x 48-72 hours then oral cephalexin 500 mg PO QID
- Elevate extremity above heart level

## Disposition

- **Replantation center transfer:** If replantation indicated — call ahead, do not delay. Package amputated part properly and send with patient.
- **OR:** Emergent for hemorrhage control; urgent for stump revision or replantation
- **Hand surgery consult:** All digit, hand, and upper extremity amputations
- **Orthopedic/trauma surgery consult:** Lower extremity amputations
- **Admit:** Most amputations require admission for wound monitoring, pain control, possible return to OR
- **Outpatient (selected cases):** Distal fingertip amputations without bone exposure (< Allen classification II) — wound care, close follow-up at 48-72 hours

## Pitfalls

1. **Improper preservation of the amputated part.** Placing the part directly on ice causes frostbite and tissue destruction. Submerging in water causes tissue maceration. Wrap in moist gauze → bag → bag on ice. Only 35% of amputated parts arrive properly preserved.

2. **Clamping vessels in the wound.** Blind clamping damages the very vessels needed for replantation. Use direct pressure or tourniquet instead.

3. **Dismissing replantation possibility without consulting a hand/replant surgeon.** Replantation decisions require specialist input. Thumbs, children, and clean sharp amputations have excellent outcomes. Call the replantation center before deciding on stump closure.

4. **Not transporting the amputated part with the patient.** The part must travel with the patient to the replantation center. Parts left behind, mislabeled, or mishandled are irretrievable losses.

5. **Focusing on the amputation while missing hemorrhagic shock.** Traumatic amputations can cause rapid exsanguination. ATLS primary survey and resuscitation take priority over limb management.

6. **Assuming lower extremity amputations are never replantable.** While rare, replantation of lower extremities is sometimes performed in children or for sharp injuries at specialized centers. Always consult before excluding the possibility.
