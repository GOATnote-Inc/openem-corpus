# Complicated Renal Colic

## Recognition

**Complicated renal colic = any of:**
- Obstructing stone + infection (obstructive pyelonephritis/pyonephrosis)
- Obstructing stone in a solitary kidney
- Bilateral obstructing stones
- Acute kidney injury from obstruction
- Refractory pain or intractable vomiting
- Stone > 10 mm unlikely to pass spontaneously

**Signs of infected obstructed system (surgical emergency):**
- Fever (> 38.0C) with obstructing stone
- Flank pain + pyuria + positive urine culture
- Sepsis physiology: tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status
- Leukocytosis with left shift

**Key distinction from simple renal colic:**
- Simple colic: pain, hematuria, small stone, no fever, normal WBC — medical expulsive therapy
- Complicated: any of the above red flags — requires urgent urology and possible emergent decompression

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| CT abdomen/pelvis non-contrast | < 60 minutes from triage |
| Blood cultures if febrile | Before antibiotics |
| Antibiotics if infected obstructed system | < 1 hour |
| Urology consultation | Immediate for emergent decompression |

1. **IV access, aggressive fluid resuscitation** if septic
2. **CT abdomen/pelvis non-contrast** — gold standard for stone location, size, hydronephrosis
3. **Labs:** CBC, BMP (creatinine), lactate, blood cultures (x2 if febrile), urinalysis, urine culture
4. **Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics** if infected obstructed system — do NOT wait for culture results
5. **Urology consultation** for emergent decompression (percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral stent)
6. **Pain control** — do NOT withhold analgesics

## Differential Diagnosis

- Simple renal colic (no infection, no AKI — medical management)
- Pyelonephritis without obstruction (no hydronephrosis on CT)
- Renal infarction (hematuria, flank pain, LDH elevated, wedge-shaped defect on contrast CT)
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (pulsatile mass, hypotension, elderly — mimics renal colic)
- Appendicitis (RLQ pain, may mimic right ureteral stone)
- Ectopic pregnancy (reproductive-age women — get hCG)
- Renal cell carcinoma (hematuria, flank mass)
- Papillary necrosis (diabetes, sickle cell, NSAID use — sloughed papilla mimics stone)

## Workup

- **CT abdomen/pelvis non-contrast:** stone size and location, degree of hydronephrosis, perinephric stranding, ureteral wall thickening. Sensitivity > 95% for stones > 3 mm
- **CBC:** leukocytosis suggests infection
- **BMP:** creatinine (AKI assessment), potassium, bicarbonate
- **Lactate:** elevated in sepsis
- **Urinalysis:** hematuria (absent in 15% of obstructing stones), pyuria, bacteriuria
- **Urine culture:** pathogen identification
- **Blood cultures x 2:** before antibiotics if febrile
- **Renal ultrasound:** alternative if CT unavailable (pregnant patients); detects hydronephrosis but poor for ureteral stones

## Treatment

### Infected Obstructed System (Surgical Emergency)
- **Emergent decompression** — either:
  - **Percutaneous nephrostomy** (IR-placed) — preferred in septic patients
  - **Retrograde ureteral stent** (urology-placed) — alternative
- **Do NOT attempt definitive stone removal during acute sepsis** — decompression only; lithotripsy/extraction after infection resolves (4-6 weeks)

### Antibiotics for Infected Obstruction
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h** (first-line)
- OR **meropenem 1 g IV q8h** (if ESBL risk or penicillin allergy)
- OR **ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h**
- Narrow based on cultures

### Sepsis Management
- **IV NS 30 mL/kg bolus** within first 3 hours
- **Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV** if MAP < 65 after fluid resuscitation
- **Lactate-guided resuscitation** — recheck q2-4h

### Pain Control
- **Ketorolac 30 mg IV** (15 mg if elderly/renal impairment) — first-line analgesic for renal colic
- **Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q15min PRN** or **hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV q15min PRN**
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** for nausea/vomiting
- **Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes** — emerging evidence as opioid-sparing alternative

### Large Stone / Obstruction Without Infection
- **Alpha-blocker:** tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO daily (medical expulsive therapy for stones 5-10 mm in distal ureter)
- **Urology follow-up** in 1-2 weeks for stones > 10 mm or persistent obstruction
- Consider earlier intervention for solitary kidney or bilateral stones

## Disposition

- **Infected obstructed system:** ICU or stepdown admission after emergent decompression
- **AKI from bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney:** Admission for decompression and monitoring
- **Large stone (> 10 mm), no infection, tolerable pain:** Discharge with urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks, alpha-blocker, analgesics, strainer
- **Refractory pain or vomiting:** Admission for IV analgesia and hydration
- **Pregnant patients with obstructing stone:** OB and urology co-management; admission if febrile or in early labor

## Pitfalls

1. **Sending a febrile patient with an obstructing stone home with oral antibiotics.** An infected obstructed collecting system requires emergent decompression. Antibiotics alone cannot sterilize a closed space. This is a surgical emergency.

2. **Attributing all flank pain to renal colic.** Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture can mimic renal colic. In any patient > 60 with first-time flank pain and hemodynamic instability, consider AAA before attributing to stones.

3. **Withholding NSAIDs due to concern about renal function.** In isolated renal colic with normal baseline creatinine, ketorolac is safe and is the most effective analgesic. Withholding it leads to unnecessary opioid use. Exception: AKI from bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney.

4. **Assuming absence of hematuria rules out stone.** Up to 15% of patients with obstructing ureteral stones have no hematuria on UA. CT is definitive.

5. **Delaying imaging to provide pain control.** Pain control and CT should happen in parallel. Do not let pain management delay the identification of a surgical emergency.
