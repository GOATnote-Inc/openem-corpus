# Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever

## Recognition

**Classic triad (present in < 60% at initial presentation):**
- Fever (usually > 39°C)
- Headache (severe, persistent)
- Rash (starts day 3-5; begins on wrists/ankles → spreads centripetally to trunk)

**Rash characteristics:**
- Macular/maculopapular initially → petechial/purpuric
- Starts on wrists and ankles (80%) → palms and soles
- Spreads to trunk
- May be absent in 10-15% of cases ("spotless RMSF")
- Rash appears late — do NOT wait for rash to treat

**Other symptoms:**
- Myalgia, arthralgia
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (may mimic acute abdomen)
- Confusion, altered mental status (encephalitis)
- Periorbital/peripheral edema
- Hepatosplenomegaly

**Severe/late manifestations:**
- DIC, purpura fulminans
- Acute respiratory distress syndrome
- Acute kidney injury
- Meningoencephalitis, seizures, coma
- Myocarditis
- Digital gangrene, limb amputation

**Risk factors:**
- Tick exposure (Dermacentor variabilis — Eastern US; D. andersoni — Western US; Rhipicephalus sanguineus — Arizona, border states)
- Spring-summer (peak April-September)
- Rural/suburban outdoor activities
- Children aged 5-9 (highest incidence and mortality)
- Immunocompromised, G6PD deficiency (more severe)

## Critical Actions

1. **Start doxycycline immediately** based on clinical suspicion — do NOT wait for serologic confirmation
2. **Doxycycline 100 mg PO/IV BID** for ALL ages, including children < 8 years and pregnant women (the only effective drug; benefits far outweigh risks)
3. **Do NOT use chloramphenicol** — associated with higher mortality than doxycycline
4. **Treat empirically** — there is no confirmatory test available in the acute window; serology requires paired sera
5. **Monitor for organ failure** — serial BMP, CBC, coags, hepatic panel

## Differential Diagnosis

- Meningococcemia — rapid purpura, meningeal signs, shock
- Ehrlichiosis/Anaplasmosis — similar tick-borne; rash uncommon; leukopenia, morulae on smear
- Secondary syphilis — non-petechial palmar rash, mucosal lesions
- Viral exanthem (measles, enterovirus) — prodromal cough/coryza, different rash distribution
- Drug eruption — temporal relationship to medication
- Endocarditis — murmur, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes
- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura — thrombocytopenia without fever
- Toxic shock syndrome — erythroderma, desquamation, hypotension
- Vasculitis — may mimic RMSF; ESR/CRP elevated, autoantibodies

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — treat empirically; do not delay for labs
- **Serology (IFA for R. rickettsii IgG/IgM):** Paired sera (acute + convalescent 2-4 weeks later); 4-fold rise is confirmatory. Acute titers are often negative in first week.
- **CBC:** Thrombocytopenia (32-52%), leukocytosis or leukopenia, anemia
- **BMP:** Hyponatremia (50%), elevated creatinine, electrolyte abnormalities
- **Hepatic panel:** Elevated AST/ALT (36-86%)
- **Coagulation:** Elevated D-dimer, prolonged PT/INR in severe cases (DIC)
- **CRP/ESR:** Elevated
- **Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry** — can confirm within 24-48h if rash present (sensitivity ~70%)
- **PCR of blood or tissue** — available at reference labs; most sensitive early in disease
- **LP** if meningitis suspected — lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein

## Treatment

### Doxycycline (Only Effective Treatment)
- **Adults:** Doxycycline 100 mg PO or IV BID
- **Children < 45 kg:** Doxycycline 2.2 mg/kg PO or IV BID (max 100 mg/dose)
- **Duration:** Continue for at least 3 days after fever resolves AND clinical improvement; minimum 5-7 days total
- **Route:** IV if unable to tolerate PO, vomiting, or critically ill

### Pregnancy
- Doxycycline is recommended even in pregnancy for suspected RMSF — untreated RMSF has 20-25% mortality, which exceeds the theoretical risk of doxycycline

### What NOT to Use
- Chloramphenicol: Higher case fatality rate than doxycycline; no longer recommended
- Fluoroquinolones: Ineffective
- Beta-lactams: Ineffective against Rickettsia (obligate intracellular organism)
- Sulfonamides: May worsen disease (historical evidence)

### Supportive Care
- IV fluid resuscitation (caution: capillary leak can cause pulmonary edema)
- Vasopressors for refractory shock
- Platelet transfusion only for active bleeding
- Mechanical ventilation for ARDS
- Renal replacement therapy for AKI

## Disposition

- **Admit:** Any patient with suspected RMSF and organ dysfunction, neurologic symptoms, severe thrombocytopenia, or inability to take oral medications
- **ICU:** DIC, ARDS, shock, encephalitis, acute renal failure
- **May discharge with close follow-up (24-48h):** Mild disease, able to tolerate PO doxycycline, reliable follow-up
- **Isolation:** Standard precautions (not transmitted person-to-person)
- **Reportable:** RMSF is nationally notifiable in the US

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for the rash to diagnose RMSF.** The classic rash may not appear until day 3-5, and 10-15% of patients never develop a rash. Starting doxycycline within the first 5 days of illness reduces mortality from 20% to < 5%. Waiting for the rash kills patients.

2. **Withholding doxycycline in children < 8 years.** The AAP and CDC both recommend doxycycline for children of ALL ages with suspected RMSF. Short courses (5-7 days) do not cause tooth staining. Using alternative antibiotics increases mortality.

3. **Using chloramphenicol as an alternative.** Multiple studies show higher mortality with chloramphenicol compared to doxycycline. It is no longer recommended.

4. **Relying on acute serology to confirm or exclude RMSF.** IFA titers are typically negative in the first 7-10 days of illness. A negative acute titer does NOT rule out RMSF. Treatment must be empiric.

5. **Missing RMSF in urban settings.** In the Southwest US and along the US-Mexico border, Rhipicephalus sanguineus (brown dog tick) transmits RMSF in urban/periurban settings. Do not assume RMSF only occurs in rural, wooded areas.

6. **Aggressive IV fluids without monitoring for pulmonary edema.** Rickettsia damages vascular endothelium, causing capillary leak. Overzealous fluid resuscitation can worsen pulmonary edema and ARDS.
