# Major Joint Dislocation

## Recognition

**Definition:** Complete loss of congruence between articular surfaces of a major joint requiring emergent reduction. Neurovascular injury occurs with increasing time to reduction.

**Anterior Shoulder Dislocation (95% of shoulder dislocations):**
- Arm held in abduction and external rotation
- Loss of normal deltoid contour; squared-off shoulder
- Palpable humeral head anteriorly/inferiorly
- Mechanism: forced abduction/external rotation (fall on outstretched hand, seizure, sports)
- Associated injuries: Hill-Sachs lesion (posterolateral humeral head compression fracture, 40-90% of dislocations), Bankart lesion (anterior-inferior glenoid labrum tear), greater tuberosity fracture, axillary nerve injury (deltoid weakness, lateral shoulder sensory loss)

**Posterior Hip Dislocation (90% of hip dislocations):**
- Classic mechanism: dashboard injury (axial force on flexed knee with hip flexed/adducted)
- Leg held in flexion, adduction, and internal rotation; limb appears shortened
- Associated injuries: sciatic nerve palsy (10-20%), posterior wall acetabular fracture (>50%), femoral head fracture, knee ligament injury (dashboard mechanism)
- AVN of femoral head: risk increases significantly if not reduced within 6 hours

**Elbow Dislocation:**
- Posterior dislocation most common (>90%)
- Mechanism: fall on outstretched hand with elbow extended
- Olecranon prominence posteriorly; forearm appears shortened
- Associated injuries: medial epicondyle fracture, coronoid process fracture, median nerve injury (anterior interosseous branch), brachial artery injury
- "Terrible triad": posterior dislocation + radial head fracture + coronoid process fracture

**Patellar Dislocation:**
- Lateral dislocation (nearly always lateral)
- Mechanism: twisting injury with knee in slight flexion, valgus stress
- Patella palpable laterally; knee held in flexion
- Risk factors: patella alta, trochlear dysplasia, increased Q-angle, prior dislocation
- May spontaneously reduce before arrival — knee effusion and medial patellar tenderness suggest reduced dislocation

## Critical Actions

1. **Pre-reduction neurovascular exam** — document distal pulses, motor, and sensation BEFORE any reduction attempt. Axillary nerve (shoulder), sciatic nerve (hip), median/ulnar nerves and brachial artery (elbow), peroneal nerve (knee/patella).
2. **Obtain pre-reduction X-rays** — identify associated fractures that may alter reduction technique or require operative management. AP and lateral views minimum. Exception: delay imaging only if there is vascular compromise requiring emergent reduction.
3. **Reduce promptly** — posterior hip dislocations must be reduced within 6 hours to minimize AVN risk. Shoulder and elbow dislocations: reduce as soon as possible to limit neurovascular injury and muscle spasm.
4. **Procedural sedation for closed reduction:**
   - Propofol 0.5-1 mg/kg IV (titrate 0.25 mg/kg boluses q30-60 sec)
   - Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV (or 4 mg/kg IM)
   - Etomidate 0.2 mg/kg IV
   - Alternative: intra-articular lidocaine 20 mL of 1% for shoulder (avoids sedation risks in select patients)
5. **Post-reduction neurovascular exam** — document immediately after reduction and compare to pre-reduction baseline.
6. **Post-reduction X-ray** — confirm congruent joint reduction and identify any new fractures caused by the reduction.
7. **Immobilize the joint** — shoulder: sling and swathe in internal rotation; hip: knee immobilizer with hip precautions; elbow: posterior splint at 90 degrees; patella: knee immobilizer in extension.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Fracture without dislocation | Deformity localized to bone; joint congruence maintained on X-ray |
| Subluxation | Partial loss of joint congruence; some joint contact maintained; may reduce spontaneously |
| Septic arthritis | Fever, joint effusion, inability to bear weight; no traumatic mechanism; aspirate joint |
| Rotator cuff tear (shoulder) | Active ROM limited but passive ROM preserved; no bony deformity; joint congruent on X-ray |
| Slipped capital femoral epiphysis | Adolescent; hip held in external rotation (opposite of posterior dislocation); physis widened on frog-leg lateral |
| Periprosthetic dislocation | History of arthroplasty; dislocation of prosthetic components on X-ray |
| Pathologic fracture-dislocation | Minimal trauma; lytic/blastic lesion on X-ray; suspect malignancy |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- Pre-reduction: AP and lateral X-ray of the affected joint
- Shoulder: AP, scapular Y, and axillary lateral views; Grashey view for glenoid assessment
- Hip: AP pelvis and cross-table lateral of the affected hip; Judet views if acetabular fracture suspected
- Elbow: AP, lateral, and oblique views
- Patella: AP, lateral, and sunrise/Merchant view
- Post-reduction: repeat AP and lateral to confirm congruent reduction
- CT: obtain after reduction for hip dislocations (identify loose bodies, occult acetabular fractures); for shoulder if concern for glenoid fracture >25% of articular surface

**Neurovascular Assessment:**
- Shoulder: axillary nerve — test regimental badge area sensation and deltoid contraction
- Hip: sciatic nerve — ankle dorsiflexion (peroneal division most vulnerable), plantar flexion, sensation foot dorsum and sole
- Elbow: median nerve (thumb-index finger OK sign, thenar sensation), ulnar nerve (finger abduction, small finger sensation), radial nerve (wrist/finger extension, first dorsal web space sensation), brachial artery (radial pulse, capillary refill)
- Patella: peroneal nerve (ankle dorsiflexion), popliteal artery (dorsalis pedis pulse)

**Labs:** Generally not required unless procedural sedation planned (pregnancy test in women of reproductive age).

## Treatment

**Anterior Shoulder Reduction Techniques (multiple options — physician preference):**
- **External rotation method:** Patient supine, elbow at 90 degrees against body. Slowly externally rotate the arm. Reduction occurs at 70-110 degrees of external rotation. Gentle, well-tolerated, high success rate.
- **Cunningham technique:** Patient seated, examiner's fist in axilla, patient relaxes and shrugs shoulders while examiner massages biceps, deltoid, and trapezius. No sedation often needed.
- **Stimson technique:** Patient prone, affected arm hanging off stretcher with 5-10 lb weight. Gravity-assisted. Requires patience (10-20 min).
- **Traction-countertraction:** Supine, sheet around thorax for countertraction, steady axial traction on arm in slight abduction with gentle external rotation.
- **Scapular manipulation:** Supine or prone, traction on arm while pushing inferior scapular tip medially and superior scapula laterally.

**Posterior Hip Reduction (Allis Technique):**
- Patient supine on stretcher. Assistant stabilizes pelvis.
- Flex hip to 90 degrees. Apply steady axial traction along the femoral shaft (pull knee toward ceiling).
- Gentle internal-to-external rotation may assist reduction.
- An audible/palpable clunk confirms reduction.
- Requires deep procedural sedation — hip muscles are powerful.

**Elbow Reduction:**
- Supine, longitudinal traction on forearm with countertraction on upper arm.
- Correct medial/lateral displacement first, then flex elbow while maintaining traction.
- Test for stability through ROM after reduction; valgus stress test for medial collateral ligament.

**Patellar Reduction:**
- Extend the knee while applying medial directed pressure on the lateral patella.
- Often reduces with knee extension alone.
- Sedation frequently unnecessary.

**Post-Reduction Immobilization:**
- Shoulder: sling and swathe, 1-2 weeks (younger patients: shorter immobilization, early rehab to prevent stiffness)
- Hip: non-weight-bearing, bed rest; orthopedic follow-up within 24-48 hours
- Elbow: posterior long-arm splint at 90 degrees flexion, 7-10 days then early ROM
- Patella: knee immobilizer in full extension, weight-bearing as tolerated

## Disposition

**Discharge (with orthopedic follow-up within 1 week):**
- Simple anterior shoulder dislocation: successful closed reduction, congruent post-reduction X-ray, intact neurovascular exam, no associated fracture requiring operative fixation
- Simple patellar dislocation: successful reduction, intact neurovascular exam, no osteochondral fracture

**Admit / Orthopedic Consult in ED:**
- All posterior hip dislocations — admit for observation, CT post-reduction, non-weight-bearing, AVN surveillance
- Elbow dislocations with instability or "terrible triad" — operative repair
- Irreducible dislocations (any joint) — emergent operative reduction
- Open dislocations — emergent operative washout and reduction
- Vascular injury — emergent vascular surgery consultation
- Associated fractures requiring surgical fixation (large Hill-Sachs, glenoid fracture >25%, acetabular fracture, femoral head fracture)

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to perform and document a pre-reduction neurovascular exam.** Without a baseline, post-reduction deficits cannot be attributed to the injury vs. the reduction. Medicolegal necessity.

2. **Delaying posterior hip dislocation reduction beyond 6 hours.** AVN of the femoral head correlates directly with time to reduction. Every hour counts. Begin sedation and reduction immediately; do not wait for the OR if closed reduction can be attempted in the ED.

3. **Missing a sciatic nerve palsy with posterior hip dislocation.** The peroneal division is most commonly injured. Test ankle dorsiflexion and foot eversion before and after reduction. Peroneal palsy causes foot drop.

4. **Not obtaining a post-reduction X-ray.** Incomplete reduction, incarcerated fragments, or iatrogenic fracture will be missed. A post-reduction film is mandatory for every dislocation.

5. **Assuming a "reduced" shoulder dislocation does not need workup.** Patellar and shoulder dislocations frequently reduce spontaneously en route. A hemarthrosis, medial patellar tenderness, or positive apprehension test after minor trauma should prompt imaging to identify osteochondral injury.

6. **Using excessive force during reduction rather than adequate sedation.** Forced reduction against muscle spasm causes iatrogenic fractures (proximal humerus, femoral neck). Achieve adequate muscle relaxation with proper procedural sedation before attempting reduction.

7. **Missing an associated fracture that changes management.** A large glenoid fracture (>25% articular surface) requires operative fixation rather than sling immobilization. A femoral neck fracture with hip dislocation is an orthopedic emergency. Always examine pre-reduction films carefully before reducing.

8. **Forgetting to test the axillary nerve after anterior shoulder dislocation.** Axillary nerve injury occurs in 5-35% of anterior dislocations, especially in patients >40 years. Test regimental badge area sensation and deltoid contraction.

9. **Splinting the elbow in full extension after reduction.** Posterior elbow dislocations should be immobilized at 90 degrees of flexion. Extension places tension on the repaired/healing collateral ligaments and risks redislocation.

10. **Discharging a patient with a posterior hip dislocation without CT.** Post-reduction plain films miss intra-articular loose bodies and small acetabular fractures. CT after hip reduction is standard of care.
