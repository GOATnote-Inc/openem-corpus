# Bowel Obstruction

## Recognition

### Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO)
- **Cardinal symptoms:** Colicky abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting (often bilious), abdominal distension, obstipation (complete obstruction) or decreased flatus
- **Vomiting:** Early and prominent in proximal SBO; late in distal SBO
- **Distension:** Minimal in proximal SBO; prominent in distal SBO
- **Bowel sounds:** High-pitched, tinkling (early mechanical obstruction) or absent (late/ileus)
- **Pain pattern:** Intermittent cramping every 3-5 minutes (mechanical); constant pain suggests strangulation

**Common causes:** Adhesions from prior surgery (60-75%), incarcerated hernia (10-15%), malignancy, Crohn disease stricture, intussusception, gallstone ileus

### Large Bowel Obstruction (LBO)
- Progressive abdominal distension (dominant feature)
- Obstipation and failure to pass flatus
- Vomiting late (feculent)
- Pain is more constant and diffuse

**Common causes:** Colorectal carcinoma (60%), diverticular stricture, volvulus (sigmoid > cecal), fecal impaction

### Signs of Strangulation (Surgical Emergency)
- Constant (non-colicky) severe pain
- Fever, tachycardia
- Peritoneal signs (rebound, guarding, rigidity)
- Leukocytosis with left shift, elevated lactate
- Hemodynamic instability
- Bloody stool or NG aspirate
- CT findings: mesenteric edema, bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis, portal venous gas, reduced wall enhancement

### Closed-Loop Obstruction
- Single point of obstruction creates isolated segment — rapid ischemia
- Volvulus is the classic cause
- Competent ileocecal valve in LBO creates a closed loop (cecal diameter >12 cm = high perforation risk)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| IV access and fluid resuscitation | Immediately (third-spacing causes significant dehydration) |
| NG tube decompression | Within 1 hour for SBO with vomiting |
| CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast | Within 2 hours |
| Surgical consultation | Immediately if strangulation or closed-loop suspected |
| Electrolyte correction | Concurrent with resuscitation |
| NPO status | Immediately |

1. Establish IV access with large-bore catheter; bolus crystalloid (LR preferred) for volume depletion
2. Place NG tube to low intermittent suction (decompresses stomach, reduces aspiration risk, measures output)
3. Place Foley catheter to monitor urine output
4. Obtain CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast to confirm diagnosis, identify transition point, and assess for strangulation
5. Consult surgery for complete obstruction, strangulation, or closed-loop findings
6. Correct electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis from vomiting)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Paralytic ileus (post-operative, medications — opioids, anticholinergics — electrolyte abnormalities, no transition point on CT)
- Acute mesenteric ischemia (pain out of proportion to exam, atrial fibrillation, lactate elevation)
- Ogilvie syndrome (acute colonic pseudo-obstruction; dilated colon without mechanical cause, typically post-operative or in critically ill patients)
- Gastroparesis (epigastric pain, early satiety, diabetic or post-surgical)
- Acute pancreatitis (epigastric pain radiating to back, elevated lipase)
- Perforated viscus (free air on imaging, peritonitis)
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm (pulsatile mass, back pain, hypotension)
- Toxic megacolon (IBD or C. difficile, colonic dilation >6 cm with systemic toxicity)

## Workup

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** Gold standard. Sensitivity >90% for SBO, identifies transition point, evaluates for strangulation (wall thickening, mesenteric haziness, reduced enhancement, pneumatosis, portal venous gas), closed-loop, and etiology. Oral contrast generally not needed and delays imaging.
- **Abdominal X-ray (upright and supine):** Dilated small bowel loops (>3 cm), air-fluid levels, paucity of distal gas. Sensitivity 60-70% — inferior to CT. Useful for serial monitoring.
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis (strangulation, perforation); hemoconcentration (dehydration)
- **BMP:** Hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis (from vomiting and NG suction), elevated BUN/creatinine (prerenal AKI from dehydration)
- **Lactate:** Elevated in bowel ischemia/strangulation (sensitivity 90%, specificity limited)
- **Lipase:** Exclude pancreatitis
- **Urinalysis:** Exclude UTI as mimicker
- **Type and screen:** If surgery likely
- **Water-soluble contrast study (Gastrografin):** Both diagnostic and therapeutic for adhesive SBO; contrast in colon at 4-8 hours predicts resolution without surgery (sensitivity 96%). Administer 100 mL Gastrografin via NG tube.

## Treatment

### Resuscitation
- **Aggressive IV crystalloid:** Patients are significantly volume-depleted from third-spacing, vomiting, and NG losses. 2-4 L in first 6 hours is common.
- **Electrolyte replacement:** Potassium chloride 20-40 mEq IV per liter of fluid; correct hypomagnesemia
- **NG tube to low intermittent suction:** Decompress stomach, reduce aspiration risk, quantify losses for replacement

### Analgesia
- **Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV** — titrate to comfort. Opioids reduce bowel motility but pain control is necessary; use judiciously.
- **Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV** — useful adjunct to reduce opioid requirement
- **Acetaminophen 1 g IV** every 6 hours as scheduled baseline

### Non-Operative Management (Adhesive SBO without Strangulation)
- NPO, NG decompression, IV fluids, electrolyte correction
- Serial abdominal exams every 4-8 hours
- **Water-soluble contrast challenge:** Gastrografin 100 mL via NG tube; X-ray at 4-8 hours — contrast in colon predicts resolution; failure to reach colon at 8 hours predicts need for surgery
- Resolution expected within 24-72 hours in 65-80% of adhesive SBO
- If no improvement by 72 hours or clinical deterioration, proceed to surgery

### Operative Management (Indications for Surgery)
- Complete SBO with no improvement after 48-72 hours of non-operative management
- Strangulation (peritonitis, fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, lactate elevation, CT signs)
- Closed-loop obstruction
- Incarcerated/strangulated hernia
- LBO from malignancy or volvulus
- Free air on imaging (perforation)

### Specific Causes
- **Sigmoid volvulus:** Endoscopic decompression (rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy) as initial management; recurrence rate 40-60%, so definitive surgery (sigmoid resection) during same admission
- **Cecal volvulus:** Surgical management (right hemicolectomy); endoscopic decompression is unreliable
- **Gallstone ileus:** Surgical enterolithotomy; cholecystectomy and fistula repair during same operation or delayed

### Antibiotics
- **Pre-operative or if strangulation suspected:** Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ceftriaxone 2 g IV + metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours
- Covers enteric gram-negatives and anaerobes

## Disposition

- **ICU:** Strangulated bowel, hemodynamic instability, post-operative after bowel resection with complications, sepsis
- **Surgical ward:** Confirmed SBO or LBO requiring admission for non-operative management or post-operative care
- **Observation (12-24 hours):** Partial SBO with low-volume NG output, improving symptoms, and contrast reaching colon
- **Discharge is rare.** Patients with resolved partial SBO, tolerating PO, passing flatus, and with reliable follow-up may be discharged with strict return precautions.

## Pitfalls

1. **Diagnosing "ileus" without CT to exclude mechanical obstruction.** Post-operative ileus is a diagnosis of exclusion. A transition point on CT distinguishes mechanical SBO (requires surgical evaluation) from ileus (supportive care). CT changes management in 20-30% of cases initially thought to be ileus.

2. **Missing strangulation because labs are normal.** Lactate sensitivity for bowel ischemia is approximately 90% but specificity is low. Normal lactate does not exclude early strangulation. CT findings (reduced wall enhancement, mesenteric edema, pneumatosis) and clinical signs (constant pain, peritonitis, tachycardia) drive the decision.

3. **Delaying NG tube placement.** NG decompression reduces aspiration risk, relieves nausea, and allows quantification of losses for fluid replacement. Place early, not as a last resort.

4. **Under-resuscitating.** Third-space losses in bowel obstruction are massive (3-6 L). Patients presenting with tachycardia and oliguria need aggressive crystalloid before any decision about operative vs. non-operative management.

5. **Failing to examine all hernia orifices.** Incarcerated inguinal, femoral, umbilical, and incisional hernias cause SBO. Missed femoral hernias in elderly women are a classic and preventable diagnostic failure. Examine the groin in every patient with SBO.

6. **Prolonging non-operative management beyond 72 hours for complete SBO.** The risk of strangulation increases with duration. If Gastrografin has not reached the colon by 8 hours, or there is no clinical improvement by 72 hours, surgery is indicated.

7. **Ignoring cecal diameter in LBO.** Cecal diameter >12 cm carries high perforation risk. An obstructing LBO with a competent ileocecal valve creates a closed loop. These patients need urgent decompression or surgery.

8. **Anchoring on "adhesive SBO" without evaluating for malignancy.** CT identifies the transition point and etiology. Even patients with prior surgery can develop obstructing tumors, internal hernias, or incarcerated hernias.

9. **Discharging without ensuring return of bowel function.** Passage of flatus and stool, tolerating oral intake, and resolution of pain are prerequisites for discharge. Premature discharge leads to re-presentation and increased morbidity.
