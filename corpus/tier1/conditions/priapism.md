# Priapism

## Recognition

**Ischemic (low-flow) — urologic emergency:**
- Persistent, fully rigid, painful erection > 4 hours
- Dark blood on corporal aspiration (pO2 < 40, pCO2 > 60, pH < 7.25)
- Most common type (> 95% of ED presentations)
- Causes: PDE-5 inhibitors, intracavernosal injections, sickle cell disease, trazodone, antipsychotics, cocaine

**Non-ischemic (high-flow) — NOT an emergency:**
- Partially rigid, painless erection after perineal/penile trauma
- Bright red blood on aspiration (arterial gases)
- Caused by unregulated arterial inflow from fistula

**Key distinction:** Ischemic priapism is a compartment syndrome of the penis. Delay > 24 hours results in near-certain erectile dysfunction.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Classification (ischemic vs non-ischemic) | < 30 minutes from arrival |
| Corporal aspiration if ischemic | Immediate |
| Phenylephrine injection if aspiration fails | Within 1 hour |
| Urology consultation | Immediate for ischemic priapism |

1. **Classify type** — history, exam rigidity, corporal blood gas
2. **Ischemic: corporal aspiration** — 16-18G butterfly needle into lateral corpus cavernosum (2 or 10 o'clock position), aspirate dark blood until detumescence
3. **If aspiration alone fails: phenylephrine injection** — dilute phenylephrine 100-500 mcg/mL in NS, inject 200 mcg (1 mL of 200 mcg/mL) into corpus cavernosum every 3-5 minutes, max total dose 1000 mcg
4. **Monitor BP and HR** with each phenylephrine injection (risk of hypertensive crisis)
5. **Sickle cell disease:** concurrent IV hydration, analgesia, exchange transfusion if refractory
6. **Non-ischemic:** observation, ice, selective angioembolization if persistent

## Differential Diagnosis

- Sickle cell vaso-occlusive crisis with priapism
- Medication-induced (PDE-5 inhibitors, intracavernosal alprostadil, trazodone, chlorpromazine)
- Perineal trauma with arterial laceration (high-flow)
- Penile fracture (acute bend with "popping" sound, unilateral swelling)
- Paraphimosis (foreskin trapped proximal to glans — edematous but not truly erect)
- Hematologic malignancy (leukemia, especially CML — leukostasis)

## Workup

- **Corporal blood gas:** aspirated blood from corpus cavernosum — ischemic (dark, venous gas) vs non-ischemic (bright, arterial gas)
- **CBC:** leukocytosis (infection), sickle cells, leukemia
- **Hemoglobin electrophoresis** if sickle cell suspected and not previously diagnosed
- **Reticulocyte count** in sickle cell patients
- **Coagulation studies** if hematologic etiology suspected
- **Penile Doppler ultrasound:** confirms absent cavernosal arterial flow (ischemic) vs high flow (non-ischemic with fistula)
- **Urine toxicology** if illicit drug use suspected

## Treatment

### Ischemic Priapism
- **Corporal aspiration:** 16-18G butterfly needle at 2 or 10 o'clock position into corpus cavernosum, aspirate 20-30 mL aliquots until detumescence
- **Phenylephrine intracavernosal injection:** 200 mcg every 3-5 minutes (max total 1000 mcg). Prepare by diluting phenylephrine 10 mg/mL to 100-500 mcg/mL with NS
- **Terbutaline 0.25 mg SQ** — adjunct, limited evidence, may help early/stuttering priapism
- **Analgesia:** dorsal penile nerve block with 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, 5 mL each side at base of penis

### Sickle Cell Priapism
- **IV NS at 1.5x maintenance rate**
- **Ketorolac 30 mg IV** or morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV for pain
- **Exchange transfusion** if refractory to aspiration/phenylephrine (target HbS < 30%)
- Aspiration and phenylephrine per standard protocol

### Refractory Ischemic Priapism
- **Surgical shunt** — distal (Winter, Al-Ghorab) then proximal if needed
- **Urgent urology consultation** for shunt placement if phenylephrine fails after 1 hour

### Non-Ischemic Priapism
- Observation — no aspiration or phenylephrine needed
- Ice and compression
- Selective arterial embolization by interventional radiology if persistent > 1 week

## Disposition

- **Ischemic, resolved with aspiration/phenylephrine:** Discharge with urology follow-up in 24-48 hours; discontinue causative medication
- **Ischemic, refractory:** Admission for surgical shunt
- **Sickle cell priapism:** Admission for exchange transfusion and monitoring
- **Non-ischemic:** Discharge with urology follow-up; elective embolization if persistent
- **All patients:** strict return precautions for recurrence

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating non-ischemic priapism with phenylephrine.** High-flow priapism is not an emergency and does not require aspiration or sympathomimetics. Doppler and blood gas distinguish the two.

2. **Delayed intervention in ischemic priapism beyond 4 hours.** Smooth muscle necrosis begins at 4-6 hours. Beyond 24-48 hours, erectile dysfunction is near-certain regardless of intervention.

3. **Using epinephrine instead of phenylephrine.** Epinephrine has beta-adrenergic effects that can cause cardiac arrhythmias. Phenylephrine is a pure alpha-1 agonist and is the correct agent.

4. **Failure to perform corporal blood gas.** Visual inspection alone (dark vs bright blood) is unreliable. Send for formal blood gas to definitively classify ischemic vs non-ischemic.

5. **Missing sickle cell disease as underlying etiology.** Priapism occurs in up to 42% of males with sickle cell disease. These patients need concurrent hematologic management, not just urologic intervention.
