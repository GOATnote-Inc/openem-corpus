# Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (IgA Vasculitis)

## Recognition

**Classic tetrad:**
1. Palpable purpura (non-thrombocytopenic) — dependent areas (buttocks, lower extremities)
2. Arthritis/arthralgia — large joints (ankles, knees)
3. Abdominal pain — colicky, may precede rash
4. Renal involvement — hematuria, proteinuria

**Typical patient:**
- Age 3-15 years (peak 4-6 years)
- Male > female (2:1)
- Often preceded by URI 1-3 weeks prior
- Rash is non-blanching, palpable, starts on lower extremities and buttocks; may extend to arms

**GI complications (50-75% of cases):**
- Colicky abdominal pain (vasculitis of bowel wall)
- Occult or gross GI bleeding
- Intussusception (2-3% — ileo-ileal, not ileocolic as in typical pediatric intussusception)
- Bowel perforation, bowel infarction (rare)

**Renal involvement (20-50%):**
- Microscopic hematuria, proteinuria
- Nephrotic or nephritic syndrome
- May develop weeks after initial presentation
- Leading cause of long-term morbidity

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Confirm non-thrombocytopenic purpura | At presentation |
| Assess for intussusception if severe abdominal pain | Immediate |
| Urinalysis for renal involvement | At presentation |
| Blood pressure measurement | At presentation |

1. **Distinguish from life-threatening causes of purpura** — obtain CBC with platelets (platelets are NORMAL in HSP; low platelets suggest ITP, TTP, DIC, or meningococcemia)
2. **Urinalysis** — hematuria and proteinuria indicate renal involvement
3. **Blood pressure** — hypertension suggests nephritis
4. **Abdominal assessment** — ultrasound if significant abdominal pain (rule out intussusception, bowel wall thickening)
5. **Pain management** — acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO q4-6h (max 75 mg/kg/day)

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Meningococcemia** (petechiae/purpura + fever + toxic appearance — a DO NOT MISS diagnosis)
- Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (thrombocytopenia — platelets < 100,000)
- Child abuse/non-accidental trauma (bruising pattern, inconsistent history)
- Hemolytic uremic syndrome (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, renal failure)
- Kawasaki disease (prolonged fever, conjunctivitis, mucositis, rash pattern differs)
- Rocky Mountain spotted fever (geographic exposure, tick bite, petechiae spread centripetally)
- Leukemia (pancytopenia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly)
- Polyarteritis nodosa (tender subcutaneous nodules, livedo)

## Workup

- **CBC with differential:** normal platelets (critical for diagnosis); normal WBC or mild leukocytosis
- **BMP:** creatinine, BUN (renal function)
- **Urinalysis with microscopy:** hematuria (RBC casts = glomerulonephritis), proteinuria
- **Urine protein-to-creatinine ratio** if proteinuria detected
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR normal (distinguishes from DIC)
- **ESR/CRP:** often mildly elevated
- **Serum IgA:** elevated in 50% (not required for diagnosis)
- **Abdominal ultrasound:** if significant abdominal pain — bowel wall thickening, intussusception (target sign), free fluid
- **Stool guaiac:** occult GI bleeding
- **Skin biopsy** (if diagnosis uncertain): leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposits on immunofluorescence

## Treatment

### Supportive Care (Majority of Cases)
- **Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO q4-6h** (max 75 mg/kg/day or 4 g/day) for pain and fever
- **Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO q6-8h** for arthralgia (avoid if renal involvement or GI bleeding)
- Adequate hydration
- Activity as tolerated (rest during acute arthritis)

### GI Involvement
- **Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day PO (max 60 mg/day)** for moderate-severe abdominal pain — accelerates resolution of GI symptoms
- Duration: 1-2 weeks with taper
- **NPO and IV fluids** if concern for surgical abdomen or intussusception

### Intussusception
- **Surgical consultation** — ileo-ileal intussusception in HSP may not reduce with air/contrast enema (unlike ileocolic)
- **Ultrasound or CT** for diagnosis
- May require operative reduction

### Renal Involvement
- **Mild (isolated hematuria, mild proteinuria):** monitor with serial urinalysis every 1-2 weeks
- **Moderate (nephrotic-range proteinuria, hypertension):** prednisone 2 mg/kg/day PO + pediatric nephrology referral
- **Severe (rapidly progressive GN, nephritic syndrome):** pulse methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV daily x 3 days (max 1 g), then oral prednisone; consider cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate per nephrology

## Disposition

- **Mild (rash, mild arthralgia, no abdominal pain, normal UA):** Discharge with pediatric follow-up in 1 week; urinalysis weekly x 4 weeks, then monthly x 6 months
- **Moderate abdominal pain without surgical concern:** observation for 6-12 hours; discharge if tolerating PO; close follow-up
- **Severe abdominal pain, GI bleeding, or intussusception:** Admission for observation, imaging, surgical consultation
- **Renal involvement (nephritic/nephrotic):** Admission for nephrology evaluation
- **All patients:** follow-up urinalysis schedule for 6 months (renal involvement can develop late)

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing meningococcemia in a child with purpura and fever.** HSP can present with fever. If the child appears toxic or hemodynamically unstable, empiric ceftriaxone and blood cultures must happen before assuming HSP. Meningococcemia kills in hours.

2. **Failing to check platelets.** The defining feature of HSP is non-thrombocytopenic purpura. Without a CBC, ITP, TTP, DIC, and leukemia remain on the differential. Platelets should be normal in HSP.

3. **Discharging without a urinalysis follow-up plan.** Renal involvement may develop up to 6 months after initial presentation. All HSP patients need serial urinalysis monitoring regardless of initial UA results.

4. **Not considering intussusception in HSP with severe abdominal pain.** HSP-related intussusception is ileo-ileal (not ileocolic) and may not be amenable to non-operative reduction. Surgical consultation is needed.

5. **Withholding steroids for significant GI disease.** Evidence supports corticosteroids for moderate-severe abdominal pain in HSP (reduces duration and severity). Delaying treatment prolongs suffering and may increase GI complication risk.
