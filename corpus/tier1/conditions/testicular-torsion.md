# Testicular Torsion

## Recognition

### Classic Presentation
- Sudden onset of severe, unilateral scrotal pain
- Onset during sleep (50-60%) or physical activity
- Nausea and vomiting (common — present in >50%)
- No urinary symptoms (dysuria, frequency suggest epididymitis)
- Peak incidence: bimodal — neonatal and 12-18 years; but occurs at any age

### Examination Findings
- High-riding testis (retracted superiorly by shortened spermatic cord)
- Transverse lie of the testis (horizontal orientation instead of vertical)
- Absent cremasteric reflex (most sensitive sign — 99% sensitivity in pediatric studies)
- Diffuse testicular tenderness and swelling
- Scrotal erythema and edema (develops over hours)
- **Negative Prehn sign:** Pain NOT relieved by testicular elevation (though unreliable)
- **Blue dot sign:** If torsion of appendix testis — small, tender, blue-black spot on upper pole (visible before edema obscures it)

### TWIST Score (Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion)
| Feature | Points |
|---|---|
| Testicular swelling | 2 |
| Hard testis | 2 |
| Absent cremasteric reflex | 1 |
| Nausea/vomiting | 1 |
| High-riding testis | 1 |

- Score >= 5: High risk — proceed to OR without imaging
- Score 2-4: Intermediate — ultrasound
- Score 0-1: Low risk — ultrasound if clinical concern remains

### Intermittent Torsion
- Recurrent episodes of acute scrotal pain that self-resolve
- History of prior similar episodes with spontaneous resolution
- Requires elective orchiopexy to prevent complete torsion

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Urology consultation | Immediately upon clinical suspicion — do NOT wait for imaging |
| Manual detorsion attempt | Within minutes if OR not immediately available |
| Doppler ultrasound | Only if diagnosis uncertain AND will not delay OR |
| OR for surgical exploration | Within 6 hours of symptom onset |
| Pain management | Immediately |

1. Call urology immediately upon suspicion — time to OR is the single most important variable
2. Attempt manual detorsion at bedside (see Treatment)
3. Provide analgesia: morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV
4. If diagnosis uncertain and urology agrees, obtain emergent scrotal Doppler ultrasound
5. Prepare for OR — NPO, IV access, pre-operative labs

## Differential Diagnosis

- Torsion of appendix testis (gradual onset, point tenderness at upper pole, blue dot sign, normal cremasteric reflex, normal blood flow on Doppler)
- Epididymitis/orchitis (gradual onset, dysuria, urethral discharge, positive Prehn sign, increased blood flow on Doppler, pyuria)
- Incarcerated inguinal hernia (inguinal mass extending to scrotum, bowel sounds in scrotum, obstructive symptoms)
- Scrotal trauma/hematocele (history of trauma, fluctuant mass)
- Henoch-Schonlein purpura (purpuric rash on lower extremities and buttocks, scrotal involvement)
- Scrotal abscess (fever, fluctuance, erythema)
- Fournier gangrene (crepitus, rapidly spreading erythema, systemic toxicity)
- Testicular tumor (gradual painless enlargement; acute pain if hemorrhage into tumor)
- Idiopathic scrotal edema (bilateral, non-tender, allergic etiology)

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis is sufficient for OR in high-probability cases.** Do NOT delay surgery for imaging when clinical suspicion is high (TWIST >= 5).
- **Scrotal Doppler ultrasound:** Absent or decreased intratesticular blood flow. Sensitivity 82-100%, specificity 97-100%. False-negative rate in early torsion or partial torsion. Whirlpool sign (twisted spermatic cord) is pathognomonic.
- **Urinalysis:** Typically normal in torsion; pyuria suggests epididymitis/UTI
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis is nonspecific
- **Urine GC/chlamydia NAAT:** If epididymitis suspected (sexually active patient with gradual onset and dysuria)
- **Color-flow Doppler:** Must evaluate intratesticular flow (not just peritesticular). Comparison with contralateral side is essential.

**Do NOT obtain:** CT, MRI, or nuclear medicine scans — they delay definitive treatment without clinical benefit.

## Treatment

### Manual Detorsion (Bedside — Temporizing, Not Definitive)
- **Open-book technique:** Rotate the affected testis medially to laterally (like opening a book) — "open the book toward the thigh"
- Typically requires 180-720 degrees of rotation (1-2 full turns)
- **Success indicators:** Immediate pain relief, testis descends to normal position, cord lengthens
- If pain worsens with lateral rotation, attempt medial rotation (one-third of torsions are lateral-to-medial)
- **Procedural sedation** with ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV or midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV + fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV improves success rate
- Manual detorsion does NOT replace surgical exploration and orchiopexy — OR still required

### Analgesia
- **Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV every 4 hours PRN**
- **Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV every 1-2 hours PRN**
- **Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV** as adjunct
- **Spermatic cord block:** 10 mL of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine infiltrated at the external inguinal ring — provides rapid analgesia for exam and manual detorsion attempt

### Surgical Management
- **Scrotal exploration with detorsion and bilateral orchiopexy** — standard of care
- Bilateral orchiopexy prevents contralateral torsion (bell clapper deformity is typically bilateral)
- **Orchiectomy** if testis is non-viable after detorsion and warm ischemia observation (20 minutes)
- Timing: within 6 hours of symptom onset for maximal salvage

### Neonatal Torsion
- Extravaginal torsion (prenatal or perinatal)
- Typically presents with painless, firm, discolored scrotal mass at birth
- Salvage rate is extremely low (<5%) as torsion occurs prenatally
- Surgical exploration for contralateral fixation is recommended to prevent asynchronous bilateral torsion

## Disposition

- **Operating room:** All confirmed or high-probability testicular torsion — this is the definitive disposition
- **Observation after successful manual detorsion:** Admitted for surgical orchiopexy during the same admission (semi-urgent, within 24 hours)
- **Discharge after negative workup:** Confirmed alternative diagnosis (appendix testis torsion, epididymitis), pain controlled, urology follow-up within 1 week
- **Never discharge a patient with testicular torsion that has not been surgically explored and fixed**

## Pitfalls

1. **Obtaining ultrasound before calling urology.** Ultrasound delays definitive treatment. Call urology at the time of clinical suspicion. If ultrasound is obtained, it must not delay OR time. A normal ultrasound does not exclude torsion (sensitivity is not 100%).

2. **Relying on the cremasteric reflex in adults.** Absent cremasteric reflex has 99% sensitivity in prepubertal boys but is less reliable in adults. A present cremasteric reflex in an adult does NOT exclude torsion.

3. **Dismissing the diagnosis because "he's too old for torsion."** Testicular torsion occurs at any age. While peak incidence is 12-18 years, cases in men >40 are well-documented. Age alone does not exclude the diagnosis.

4. **Anchoring on epididymitis in a young patient.** Sexually active adolescents and young men develop torsion. Gradual onset and dysuria favor epididymitis, but sudden onset of severe pain requires torsion workup regardless of age or sexual history.

5. **Failing to attempt manual detorsion while awaiting OR.** Every minute of ischemia reduces salvage probability. Manual detorsion is a bedside temporizing measure that restores blood flow in 26-95% of attempts. Attempt it while mobilizing the OR team.

6. **Rotating in the wrong direction and abandoning the attempt.** One-third of torsions are lateral-to-medial (the reverse of typical). If pain worsens with lateral rotation, try medial rotation before concluding manual detorsion has failed.

7. **Accepting a "normal" ultrasound at face value.** Early torsion or partial torsion may show preserved or even increased flow (reactive hyperemia). The whirlpool sign and comparison with the contralateral testis improve accuracy. If clinical suspicion remains high, proceed to surgical exploration despite normal Doppler.

8. **Not performing bilateral orchiopexy.** Bell clapper deformity is bilateral in >80% of cases. Unilateral fixation leaves the contralateral testis at risk. Standard of care is bilateral orchiopexy at the time of surgical exploration.

9. **Discharging intermittent torsion without urology referral.** Recurrent episodes of self-resolving scrotal pain represent intermittent torsion until proven otherwise. These patients require elective orchiopexy to prevent complete torsion.
