# Sickle Cell Vaso-Occlusive Crisis

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Deoxygenated hemoglobin S polymerizes, causing RBC sickling, vascular occlusion, ischemia, and inflammatory cascade activation. Triggers include infection, dehydration, hypoxia, cold exposure, stress, and menstruation.

**Classic Presentation:**
- Severe pain in bones, chest, abdomen, or joints — often in established pattern for each patient
- Pain disproportionate to exam findings
- Tachycardia, low-grade fever (sickle cell itself causes fever; do not dismiss infection)
- Patients often know their baseline hemoglobin and typical crisis pattern

**Life-Threatening Complications to Identify Immediately:**
- **Acute chest syndrome (ACS):** new pulmonary infiltrate + fever, chest pain, hypoxia, tachypnea, or cough. Leading cause of death in SCD. Can evolve from simple VOC within hours.
- **Stroke:** sudden focal neurological deficit, altered mental status, seizure. Prevalence 11% by age 20. Ischemic > hemorrhagic in children; hemorrhagic more common in adults.
- **Splenic sequestration:** acute left upper quadrant pain, rapidly enlarging spleen, dropping hemoglobin > 2 g/dL below baseline, hypovolemic shock. Primarily children < 5 years (functional asplenia develops later).
- **Aplastic crisis:** parvovirus B19 infection, reticulocyte count near zero, severe anemia, no splenomegaly.
- **Priapism:** painful sustained erection > 4 hours. Urologic emergency.
- **Hepatic sequestration:** RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, rising bilirubin, dropping hemoglobin.

## Critical Actions

1. **Administer analgesics within 30 minutes of triage** — parenteral opioids are first-line. Morphine 0.1-0.15 mg/kg IV or hydromorphone 0.015-0.02 mg/kg IV. Reassess and re-dose every 15-30 minutes until pain controlled.
2. **Obtain CXR if any respiratory symptoms** — new infiltrate with fever/hypoxia/chest pain = acute chest syndrome. Start treatment immediately.
3. **Check hemoglobin against patient's baseline** — a drop of >2 g/dL from baseline signals sequestration or aplastic crisis requiring transfusion.
4. **Assess for stroke** — any neurological change warrants emergent CT head followed by CT angiography. Notify hematology for emergent exchange transfusion.
5. **IV hydration with isotonic saline** — NS or LR at 1-1.5x maintenance rate. Avoid overhydration (risk of ACS, pulmonary edema).
6. **Administer supplemental O2 only if hypoxic** (SpO2 < 95%). Unnecessary O2 suppresses erythropoietin and is not beneficial.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Acute chest syndrome | New infiltrate on CXR, hypoxia, may overlap with VOC presentation |
| Pneumonia | Fever, productive cough, focal consolidation — can trigger and coexist with ACS |
| Pulmonary embolism | SCD is a hypercoagulable state; pleuritic chest pain, hypoxia, positive CTPA |
| Osteomyelitis (Salmonella, Staph) | Focal bone pain with fever, elevated CRP/ESR, MRI distinguishes from bone infarction |
| Acute abdomen (cholecystitis, appendicitis) | Pigmented gallstones common in SCD; RUQ pain with Murphy sign; imaging distinguishes |
| Meningitis | SCD patients are functionally asplenic — encapsulated organism infections occur; fever, neck stiffness, AMS |
| Aplastic crisis | Reticulocyte count < 1%, parvovirus B19 IgM positive, severe anemia |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- CBC with reticulocyte count — compare hemoglobin to known baseline. Reticulocyte count differentiates aplastic crisis (low) from sequestration/hemolysis (elevated).
- BMP — renal function, electrolytes
- Hepatic panel, LDH, total/direct bilirubin, haptoglobin — hemolysis markers
- Type and screen — anticipate possible transfusion
- Blood cultures — if fever > 38.5°C (functional asplenia = risk for encapsulated organisms)
- UA — renal papillary necrosis causes hematuria
- Urinalysis and urine culture if urinary symptoms
- Lipase — if abdominal pain
- Parvovirus B19 IgM — if aplastic crisis suspected (reticulocyte count near zero)

**Imaging:**
- CXR — mandatory if chest pain, fever, hypoxia, tachypnea, or cough
- CT head without contrast — if any neurological deficit
- CT angiography head/neck — if stroke suspected
- Abdominal ultrasound — if acute abdomen, RUQ pain, or suspected splenic/hepatic sequestration
- MRI — if osteomyelitis vs. bone infarction differentiation needed (not emergent)

## Treatment

**Pain Management (ASH 2020 Guidelines):**
- Parenteral opioids within 30 minutes of triage: morphine 0.1-0.15 mg/kg IV or hydromorphone 0.015-0.02 mg/kg IV
- Reassess pain every 15-30 minutes; re-dose until controlled
- Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV as adjunct (ceiling dose 30 mg; avoid if renal insufficiency)
- Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO/IV as scheduled adjunct
- PCA pump for admitted patients with refractory pain
- Do NOT use meperidine (lowers seizure threshold, neurotoxic metabolite normeperidine)
- Avoid under-dosing: these patients have opioid tolerance — honor their home regimen and crisis history

**Acute Chest Syndrome:**
- Empiric antibiotics covering atypical organisms: ceftriaxone 2g IV daily PLUS azithromycin 500 mg IV/PO daily
- Incentive spirometry every 2 hours while awake (prevents atelectasis progression to ACS)
- Simple transfusion to target hemoglobin 10 g/dL (do not exceed 10 — hyperviscosity risk)
- Exchange transfusion if severe ACS (PaO2 < 60 mmHg, rapid progression, multilobar disease). Target HbS < 30%.

**Stroke:**
- Emergent exchange transfusion — target HbS < 30%, hemoglobin 10 g/dL
- tPA is NOT first-line in SCD stroke — exchange transfusion is the standard of care
- Hematology and neurology co-management

**Splenic Sequestration:**
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (NS 20 mL/kg bolus, repeat as needed)
- Emergent transfusion — transfuse carefully, as sequestered cells re-enter circulation as spleen shrinks, causing rebound polycythemia
- Pediatric surgery consultation for splenectomy if recurrent

**Priapism:**
- Aspiration of corpora cavernosa with 18g butterfly needle, irrigation with phenylephrine 200 mcg/mL (dilute in NS), inject 1 mL aliquots every 3-5 minutes (max 1 mg total)
- Urology consultation for refractory cases or shunt procedure

**Fever >38.5°C:**
- Blood cultures x2 before antibiotics
- Empiric antibiotics covering encapsulated organisms: ceftriaxone 2g IV
- Low threshold for admission — functional asplenia makes sepsis rapid and lethal

## Disposition

**Admit to ICU:**
- Acute chest syndrome with hypoxia (SpO2 < 92% on supplemental O2) or rapid progression
- Stroke or TIA
- Splenic sequestration with hemodynamic instability
- Exchange transfusion required
- Sepsis or meningitis

**Admit to Telemetry/Floor:**
- Pain uncontrolled after 3 doses of parenteral opioids in ED
- Acute chest syndrome (mild-moderate)
- Fever > 38.5°C requiring IV antibiotics and observation
- Hemoglobin drop >2 g/dL from baseline
- Aplastic crisis

**Discharge with Close Follow-up (24-48 hours):**
- Pain controlled with oral analgesics
- No fever, no hypoxia, normal hemoglobin for patient
- Reliable follow-up with hematology
- Discharge with oral opioids, NSAIDs, and acetaminophen

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing pain as drug-seeking.** SCD pain is severe, undertreated, and associated with frequent ED visits. Patients with SCD have measurable ischemic tissue injury. Delayed analgesia worsens outcomes and drives avoidance of care.

2. **Failing to recognize acute chest syndrome early.** ACS evolves from simple VOC. Any respiratory symptom during a pain crisis — fever, cough, chest pain, tachypnea, hypoxia — warrants CXR and empiric ACS treatment. CXR infiltrate may lag behind clinical presentation by 24-48 hours.

3. **Overtransfusing past hemoglobin 10 g/dL.** Hemoglobin > 10 in SCD causes hyperviscosity, worsening vaso-occlusion, stroke risk, and ACS. Simple transfusion target is 10 g/dL, not higher.

4. **Using meperidine (Demerol).** Normeperidine accumulates, causing seizures. Contraindicated in SCD per ASH and NHLBI guidelines.

5. **Giving supplemental oxygen to non-hypoxic patients.** O2 in normoxic SCD patients suppresses erythropoietin, reduces reticulocyte production, and provides no benefit. Reserve for SpO2 < 95%.

6. **Forgetting functional asplenia in febrile patients.** By age 5, most SCD patients have functional asplenia. Encapsulated organisms (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis) cause fulminant sepsis. Fever >38.5°C requires blood cultures and empiric ceftriaxone 2g IV.

7. **Not checking reticulocyte count.** A low reticulocyte count with severe anemia points to aplastic crisis (parvovirus B19), not hemolysis or sequestration. Treatment is simple transfusion and supportive care; the infection is self-limited but profoundly dangerous without RBC production.

8. **Missing stroke in young patients.** SCD stroke incidence peaks in childhood. Subtle findings — slurred speech, unilateral weakness, altered behavior — require emergent CT head. Exchange transfusion is the treatment, not tPA.

9. **Aggressive IV hydration causing ACS or pulmonary edema.** Hydrate at 1-1.5x maintenance, not wide-open boluses. SCD patients have chronic anemia with compensatory high-output cardiac physiology and are susceptible to volume overload.
