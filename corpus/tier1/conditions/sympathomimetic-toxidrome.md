# Sympathomimetic Toxidrome

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Stimulant toxicity results from excess catecholaminergic stimulation at adrenergic receptors. Mechanisms vary by agent:
- **Cocaine:** Blocks catecholamine reuptake (norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin transporters) AND produces local anesthetic/sodium channel blockade — uniquely cardiotoxic combination. Vasoconstriction + tachycardia + coronary artery spasm.
- **Amphetamines/methamphetamine:** Force catecholamine release from presynaptic terminals + block reuptake; prolonged action compared to cocaine. MDMA (ecstasy) adds serotonin release — overlap with serotonin syndrome.
- **Synthetic cathinones ("bath salts"):** Amphetamine-like mechanism; highly potent; extreme agitation, psychosis, and hyperthermia.
- **PCP:** NMDA antagonism + sympathomimetic effects; nystagmus (rotatory/vertical) distinguishes it from pure sympathomimetics.

**Classic Toxidrome Features:**
- Tachycardia (sinus, often >120 bpm)
- Hypertension (often severe: SBP >180-200 mmHg)
- Hyperthermia (from increased motor activity, vasoconstriction, and uncoupled metabolism)
- Diaphoresis (unlike anticholinergic toxidrome)
- Mydriasis
- Agitation, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis
- Tremor, hyperreflexia
- Hyperactive bowel sounds (unlike anticholinergic)

**Cocaine-Specific Clinical Presentations:**
- **Chest pain:** Most common cocaine-related ED presentation. Vasospasm + platelet aggregation + accelerated atherosclerosis. Young patients with ischemic ECG changes or troponin elevation. Cocaine MI occurs with both clean coronary arteries and fixed coronary disease.
- **Intracranial hemorrhage:** Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage or ruptured aneurysm/AVM in setting of acute cocaine use. Any focal deficit or severe headache requires immediate CT.
- **Aortic dissection:** Cocaine-induced severe hypertension can precipitate dissection.
- **Coronary vasospasm:** May occur even at therapeutic doses of cocaine administered medically; unpredictable.

**Hyperthermic Crisis:** Temperature >40°C (104°F) with sympathomimetic toxidrome = life-threatening emergency. Hyperthermia + agitation → rhabdomyolysis → AKI + hyperkalemia → cardiac arrest. Core temperature >41°C within 30 minutes of onset is uniformly fatal without aggressive cooling.

**Drug-Specific Timeline:**
- Cocaine (smoked/IV): onset 30-60 seconds, duration 20-45 minutes
- Cocaine (intranasal): onset 3-5 minutes, duration 60-90 minutes
- Amphetamines (oral): onset 30-60 minutes, duration 4-12 hours
- Methamphetamine: onset and duration similar to amphetamines; more potent CNS stimulation
- MDMA: onset 30-60 min, duration 3-5 hours; peak serotonin effects at 60-90 min

## Critical Actions

1. **Benzodiazepines — cornerstone of treatment.** Diazepam 10-20 mg IV, repeat every 5 minutes until agitation controlled. The physiologic excess in sympathomimetic toxidrome (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia) is driven by catecholamine excess and agitation-related motor output. Benzodiazepines reduce sympathetic tone, motor agitation, seizure threshold, and hypertension simultaneously. Do not use as a PRN drug — titrate to clinical effect.

2. **Active cooling for hyperthermia** — target core temperature <39°C within 30-60 minutes. Evaporative cooling (mist water + fan): most efficient for mild-moderate hyperthermia. Ice water immersion for temperatures >40°C (most rapid cooling method; monitor continuously). Ice packs to groin/axillae/neck as adjunct. Do not rely on benzodiazepines alone to lower temperature — paralysis and sedation may be required for intractable hyperthermia.

3. **CT head immediately for focal neurological deficits, severe headache (thunderclap), or altered mental status not rapidly improving with benzodiazepines.** Cocaine-associated intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, or hypertensive encephalopathy require urgent neurosurgical or stroke team evaluation.

4. **Nitrates or phentolamine for cocaine-associated chest pain with hypertension.** Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL (repeat every 5 min), or NTG infusion 5-100 mcg/min IV. Phentolamine (alpha-blocker) 1-2.5 mg IV for refractory coronary vasospasm — classically cited but less commonly used. Benzodiazepines are first-line (reduce sympathetic drive → coronary vasodilation).

5. **AVOID beta-blockers in cocaine toxicity.** Beta-blockade in cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm causes unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation → worsened vasoconstriction → paradoxical increase in coronary artery spasm, systemic hypertension, and reduced cardiac output. This includes labetalol (despite alpha + beta blockade, the beta component dominates and is harmful). Carvedilol has been studied in stable cocaine patients but is not appropriate for acute toxicity management.

6. **Rhabdomyolysis management** — aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with NS 1-2 L/hr to maintain urine output >1-2 mL/kg/hr. Check CK every 4-6 hours. Urinary alkalinization (sodium bicarbonate) for severe rhabdomyolysis (CK >10,000 IU/L) to prevent myoglobin precipitation in renal tubules.

7. **Hypertensive emergency management** (SBP >180 mmHg with end-organ damage: neurological change, chest pain, pulmonary edema):
   - After benzodiazepines: nicardipine 5 mg/hr IV (titrate up 2.5 mg/hr q15 min, max 15 mg/hr), or clevidipine, or sodium nitroprusside for refractory cases
   - Phentolamine 1-2.5 mg IV for cocaine-specific alpha-mediated hypertension

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Anticholinergic toxidrome | DRY skin vs. diaphoresis; urinary retention; decreased bowel sounds; physostigmine responsive |
| Serotonin syndrome | Clonus, hyperreflexia, tremor, diaphoresis, SSRI/MAOI history; cyproheptadine treatment |
| Thyroid storm | Known thyroid disease, high TSH/T4; similar hyperadrenergic state |
| Alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens | Alcohol history, tremor, diaphoresis; no pupil dilation; CIWA protocol |
| Pheochromocytoma crisis | Paroxysmal hypertension, no drug history; plasma metanephrines elevated |
| Heat stroke | Environmental exposure, exertional history; may coexist with sympathomimetic toxidrome |
| Excited delirium syndrome | Extreme hyperthermia, bizarre behavior, pain insensitivity; may be caused by stimulant use |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- Serum electrolytes, BMP — hyponatremia with MDMA (SIADH), hypokalemia (catecholamine effect)
- Creatine kinase — rhabdomyolysis (check at presentation and every 4-6 hours)
- Troponin — myocardial injury (cocaine-associated MI)
- Creatinine — AKI from rhabdomyolysis, hemodynamic injury, or vasospasm
- Lactate — tissue hypoperfusion with severe toxicity
- BNP if pulmonary edema suspected
- Urine drug screen — qualitative cocaine metabolites (benzoylecgonine), amphetamines
- Urine myoglobin — if significant rhabdomyolysis suspected
- CBC — hematocrit (cocaine-associated stroke/hemorrhage)
- Coagulation — DIC possible in extreme hyperthermia

**ECG:**
- Sinus tachycardia (most common)
- QTc prolongation (cocaine sodium channel blockade, MDMA)
- QRS widening (cocaine sodium channel block at very high doses)
- ST elevation in cocaine MI — distinguish from Brugada-type pattern vs. true STEMI (cath lab decision)
- Arrhythmias: SVT, VT (rare unless hyperthermia/ischemia present)

**Imaging:**
- CT head non-contrast: immediate if focal deficits, thunderclap headache, persistently altered mental status, or known coagulopathy with cocaine use
- CT angiography (head/neck): if ischemic stroke pattern or severe headache with negative non-contrast CT
- Chest X-ray: pulmonary edema, widened mediastinum (aortic dissection)
- CT chest/abdomen if aortic dissection suspected (tearing chest/back pain, pulse differentials)

## Treatment

**Sedation/Agitation:**
- Diazepam 10-20 mg IV q5 min until calm — no upper limit if cardiovascular/neurological endpoints improving
- Lorazepam 2-4 mg IV as alternative (shorter acting)
- Ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV (or 4 mg/kg IM) for extreme agitation/excited delirium requiring rapid sedation — does not worsen catecholamine state significantly; does not cause respiratory depression at dissociative doses
- Propofol infusion (1-4 mg/kg/hr) for intubated patients

**Cocaine Chest Pain:**
- Aspirin 324 mg PO (antiplatelet for MI component)
- Benzodiazepines first (IV diazepam or lorazepam)
- Nitroglycerin SL 0.4 mg q5 min x 3, then IV infusion if needed
- Heparin if NSTEMI criteria met (troponin elevation + ECG changes)
- Emergent cardiac catheterization for STEMI (true ST elevation in ≥2 contiguous leads with clinical picture consistent with acute MI — not just vasospasm pattern)
- Calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem) as alternative vasodilators for cocaine coronary spasm

**Hyperthermia:**
- Active cooling: ice water immersion (most effective), evaporative cooling, ice packs
- Paralysis with rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg IV) + intubation for temperatures >41°C with refractory agitation
- Core temperature monitoring (rectal or esophageal) — do not rely on axillary or tympanic

**Rhabdomyolysis:**
- NS 1-2 L/hr IV until urine output 1-2 mL/kg/hr
- Urinary alkalinization if CK >10,000 IU/L: NaHCO3 150 mEq in 1L D5W at 250 mL/hr; target urine pH >6.5
- Dialysis consultation for AKI with oliguria or life-threatening hyperkalemia

**Hypertensive Emergency:**
- Benzodiazepines first — reduce neurogenic hypertension
- Nicardipine 5-15 mg/hr IV (preferred calcium channel blocker; titratable)
- Sodium nitroprusside 0.5-10 mcg/kg/min IV for refractory cases (cyanide monitoring for >24h use)
- NO beta-blockers (cocaine) — may use in pure amphetamine hypertension without coronary ischemia

## Disposition

**ICU:**
- Hyperthermia >40°C
- Rhabdomyolysis with AKI
- Intracranial hemorrhage or ischemic stroke
- Cocaine MI requiring catheterization or anticoagulation monitoring
- Refractory agitation requiring continuous sedation or intubation
- Hypertensive emergency with end-organ damage
- DIC, multiorgan failure

**Monitored Observation (6-12 hours):**
- Resolved agitation and vital signs normalized with benzodiazepines
- Cocaine chest pain with negative troponin and non-ischemic ECG — observe for cocaine MI (troponin peak 4-6h post-ischemia)
- CK elevation without renal compromise

**Discharge:**
- Normal vital signs (HR <100, BP <140/90) for minimum 6 hours
- Normal ECG, negative troponin (at 4-6h), no chest pain
- CK trending down
- Psychiatric evaluation for intentional use with suicidal intent

## Pitfalls

1. **Giving beta-blockers to a patient with cocaine-associated chest pain.** This is a well-known but repeatedly committed error. Beta-blockade causes unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation in the cocaine-poisoned patient, worsening coronary vasospasm and hypertension. Labetalol is NOT safe in this context — the beta component still causes paradoxical worsening. Benzodiazepines, nitrates, and calcium channel blockers are safe alternatives.

2. **Underestimating hyperthermia severity and speed.** A temperature of 40°C in an agitated stimulant patient can reach 41.5°C in 15-20 minutes if not actively cooled. Passive cooling and room temperature IV fluids are insufficient for hyperthermic crisis. Have ice water or ice packs at the bedside before the patient arrives if the triage note says "hot, agitated, stimulant use."

3. **Attributing all cocaine chest pain to anxiety or musculoskeletal causes.** The cocaine-using patient with chest pain has a 6-fold increased risk of acute MI compared to age-matched controls. Obtain serial troponins (0, 3h, 6h), ECG on arrival and after treatment. Do not discharge from triage on the basis of "normal" triage ECG without serial monitoring.

4. **Missing concurrent serotonin syndrome with MDMA use.** MDMA causes both sympathomimetic and serotonin-releasing effects. A patient with clonus (especially lower extremity), hyperreflexia, and diaphoresis may have serotonin syndrome on top of sympathomimetic toxidrome. Cyproheptadine 12 mg PO (then 2 mg q2h) targets the serotonin component; benzodiazepines manage both.

5. **Delaying CT head in cocaine-related hypertension with headache.** Cocaine-associated intracranial hemorrhage has a peak incidence within 1-2 hours of use, driven by acute hypertensive surge. A thunderclap headache or sudden "worst headache of life" in a cocaine user is subarachnoid hemorrhage until proven otherwise. Do not treat the headache with analgesics and discharge without imaging.

6. **Inadequately treating rhabdomyolysis early.** A stimulant patient with a CK of 5,000-10,000 IU/L on first draw is going to 50,000-100,000 IU/L by 6-12 hours if agitation continues. Prevent the rise with aggressive benzodiazepine sedation and immediate IV hydration. Waiting until AKI develops is too late.
