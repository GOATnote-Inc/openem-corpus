# Acute Compartment Syndrome

## Recognition

**Definition:** Elevated pressure within a closed fascial compartment compromises perfusion of the muscles and nerves within that compartment. Untreated, irreversible muscle necrosis and nerve damage occur within 6-8 hours.

**Classic Presentation:**
- Tibial shaft fracture (most common association — 1-10% incidence)
- Forearm fracture (supracondylar humerus fracture in children)
- Severe pain out of proportion to the injury
- Tense, swollen extremity

**The 6 P's (in order of onset):**
1. **Pain** (earliest and most reliable) — severe, progressive, out of proportion to injury. Worsened by passive stretch of the muscles in the affected compartment.
2. **Pressure** — compartment feels tense, woody, and firm on palpation
3. **Paresthesias** — sensory deficit in the distribution of nerves traversing the compartment
4. **Paresis/Paralysis** — weakness or inability to move digits (LATE finding)
5. **Pallor** — pale, cool skin (LATE)
6. **Pulselessness** — absent distal pulses (VERY LATE — compartment syndrome is a diagnosis of tissue-level ischemia; arterial inflow is intact until very late. A palpable pulse does NOT exclude compartment syndrome.)

**High-Risk Scenarios:**
- Tibial shaft fractures (highest risk)
- Forearm fractures (especially both-bone)
- Supracondylar humerus fractures (children — anterior forearm compartment)
- Crush injuries
- Circumferential burns or constrictive casts/dressings
- Reperfusion after vascular repair (> 4-6 hours of ischemia)
- Anticoagulation with closed fracture (expanding hematoma)
- Patients unable to report pain: intubated, obtunded, regional/nerve block, pediatric

**Anatomic Compartments Most Affected:**
- Leg (4 compartments): anterior (most common), lateral, superficial posterior, deep posterior
- Forearm (3 compartments): volar (most common), dorsal, mobile wad
- Hand, thigh, foot, gluteal compartments — less common but possible

## Critical Actions

1. **Remove all circumferential dressings, casts, and splints** — immediately. Cast bivalving reduces intracompartmental pressure by 40-65%. Split underlying padding down to skin.
2. **Keep the limb at heart level** — do NOT elevate above the heart (reduces perfusion pressure) or hang dependent (increases edema).
3. **Measure compartment pressure** — if clinical exam equivocal. Stryker intracompartmental pressure monitor or arterial line transducer. Diagnostic thresholds: absolute pressure > 30 mmHg, OR delta pressure (diastolic BP minus compartment pressure) < 30 mmHg.
4. **Emergent orthopedic/surgical consultation** — for fasciotomy. Clinical diagnosis is sufficient — do not delay for pressure measurement if clinical picture is clear.
5. **Treat pain** — IV opioids (morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV, hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV). Inadequate analgesia despite appropriate opioid dosing supports the diagnosis. Avoid regional nerve blocks in at-risk patients (masks the pain signal).
6. **Prepare for fasciotomy** — the only definitive treatment. Full release of all compartments in the affected extremity.
7. **Monitor for rhabdomyolysis** — IV NS bolus (target UOP 1-2 mL/kg/hr), check CK, BMP, urinalysis for myoglobinuria.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Fracture pain (uncomplicated) | Pain improves with immobilization; no pain with passive stretch; compartments soft |
| Deep vein thrombosis | Swelling, calf tenderness, but compartments not tense; Doppler positive; no pain with passive stretch |
| Arterial occlusion | Pulselessness, pallor, cool extremity — but compartment syndrome has intact pulses until very late. Assess ankle-brachial index. |
| Rhabdomyolysis without compartment syndrome | Elevated CK, myoglobinuria, diffuse myalgias; but compartments are soft and non-tense |
| Neuropraxia / nerve injury | Sensory/motor deficit from direct nerve injury at fracture site; no compartment tension |
| Cellulitis | Erythema, warmth, but no compartment tension, no pain with passive stretch |
| Chronic exertional compartment syndrome | Recurrent exercise-induced leg pain that resolves with rest; not an emergency |
| Complex regional pain syndrome | Chronic, burning pain, allodynia; no acute compartment tension |

## Workup

**Clinical diagnosis takes priority. Labs and imaging should not delay fasciotomy.**

**Physical Exam (most important):**
- Pain with passive stretch of muscles in suspected compartment:
  - Anterior leg: pain with passive plantar flexion of toes and ankle
  - Deep posterior leg: pain with passive dorsiflexion of toes
  - Volar forearm: pain with passive extension of fingers and wrist
- Compartment palpation: tense, firm, "woody" feel
- Sensory exam: first web space (anterior leg — deep peroneal nerve), plantar foot (deep posterior — tibial nerve)
- Motor exam: toe dorsiflexion (anterior), toe plantar flexion (deep posterior)

**Compartment Pressure Measurement:**
- Stryker STIC catheter or arterial line transducer technique
- Measure ALL compartments in the affected extremity
- Diagnostic criteria:
  - Absolute pressure > 30 mmHg
  - Delta pressure (diastolic BP - compartment pressure) < 30 mmHg (more reliable in hypotensive patients)
- False negatives: single-point measurement can miss evolving syndrome. Serial measurements q1-2h if clinical suspicion persists.

**Labs:**
- CK (creatine kinase) — often markedly elevated (> 5x ULN)
- BMP — hyperkalemia (cell lysis), elevated creatinine (myoglobin-induced AKI)
- Urinalysis — tea-colored urine, positive for blood on dipstick without RBCs on microscopy (myoglobinuria)
- CBC, coagulation studies
- Lactate
- Serum myoglobin (if available)

**Imaging:**
- X-ray of the extremity — characterize fracture
- CT angiography — if concurrent arterial injury suspected
- Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) — emerging noninvasive tool, monitors tissue oxygen saturation

## Treatment

**Pre-Fasciotomy Measures:**
- Remove all constrictive dressings, casts, splints — split to skin
- Position limb at heart level
- IV NS bolus for hydration (rhabdomyolysis prevention)
- IV opioid analgesia
- Correct coagulopathy if present
- Avoid ice (vasoconstrictive — worsens ischemia)

**Fasciotomy:**
- Emergent 4-compartment fasciotomy (leg) or volar/dorsal fasciotomy (forearm)
- Leg: two-incision technique (anterolateral and posteromedial) to release all 4 compartments
- Forearm: volar curvilinear incision from proximal to carpal tunnel, +/- dorsal incision
- Wounds left open (delayed primary closure or skin grafting at 48-72 hours)
- Negative pressure wound therapy (wound VAC) over open fasciotomy wounds

**Rhabdomyolysis Management:**
- Aggressive IV NS — target UOP 200-300 mL/hr (1-2 mL/kg/hr minimum)
- Monitor potassium q4-6h — treat hyperkalemia aggressively (calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate, kayexalate)
- Avoid nephrotoxins (NSAIDs, contrast dye, aminoglycosides)
- Sodium bicarbonate infusion (150 mEq in 1L D5W) — alkalinize urine to pH > 6.5 to prevent myoglobin precipitation in renal tubules
- Mannitol 1-2 g/kg IV — osmotic diuresis (controversial, avoid in anuric patients)

**Late Presentation (> 24-36 hours):**
- Fasciotomy in established (> 36 hours) compartment syndrome is controversial — risk of reperfusion injury, sepsis, and renal failure from massive myoglobin release
- Orthopedic consultation for decision on late fasciotomy vs. expectant management

## Disposition

**All confirmed or suspected compartment syndrome requires admission.**

**Operative:**
- Emergent fasciotomy — time to fasciotomy is the primary determinant of outcome
- < 6 hours: excellent functional outcomes expected
- 6-12 hours: partial recovery likely
- > 12 hours: significant permanent muscle/nerve damage

**Postoperative:**
- ICU if rhabdomyolysis with AKI, hyperkalemia, or multisystem injury
- Monitored surgical bed — serial neurovascular exams, CK trending
- Repeat I&D at 48-72 hours; delayed wound closure when edema resolves

**Non-Operative (observation for at-risk patients):**
- Tibial fracture patients: serial exams q1-2h for first 24-48 hours
- Admit to monitored bed with nursing neurovascular check protocol
- Low threshold for compartment pressure measurement if exam changes

## Pitfalls

1. **Relying on pulselessness to diagnose compartment syndrome.** Compartment syndrome is tissue-level ischemia within a closed space. Arterial inflow is preserved until very late. A palpable dorsalis pedis pulse does NOT exclude the diagnosis.

2. **Placing a regional nerve block in a patient at risk for compartment syndrome.** Nerve blocks (femoral, sciatic, popliteal) abolish the pain signal that is the earliest and most reliable indicator. Avoid or use with extreme caution in tibial fractures and other high-risk injuries.

3. **Attributing escalating pain to fracture alone and undertreating rather than reassessing.** Pain out of proportion that worsens despite appropriate opioid doses and immobilization is compartment syndrome until proven otherwise.

4. **Failing to measure compartment pressures in obtunded or intubated patients.** Unreliable exam (altered mental status, intoxication, sedation, spinal cord injury) mandates objective pressure monitoring at serial intervals.

5. **Not checking all compartments.** The leg has 4 compartments. Measuring only the anterior compartment misses deep posterior compartment syndrome. All compartments must be measured.

6. **Elevating the limb above the heart.** Elevation reduces arterial perfusion pressure to the compartment. Keep the limb at heart level — not above, not below.

7. **Applying ice to the affected limb.** Ice causes vasoconstriction, reducing already compromised tissue perfusion. External cooling worsens ischemia.

8. **Missing compartment syndrome in children with supracondylar humerus fractures.** Forearm compartment syndrome occurs in 0.1-0.3% of supracondylar fractures. Children are unreliable historians — increasing analgesic requirements, excessive pain with finger extension, and tense forearm are red flags.

9. **Diagnosing compartment syndrome with a single normal pressure measurement.** Compartment syndrome evolves over hours. A single measurement at presentation may be normal. Serial measurements (q1-2h) and clinical reassessment are required in at-risk patients.
