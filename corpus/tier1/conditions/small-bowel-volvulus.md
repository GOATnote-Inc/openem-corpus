# Small Bowel Volvulus

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Sudden-onset severe periumbilical or diffuse abdominal pain
- Bilious vomiting (early and prominent)
- Rapid clinical deterioration — pain out of proportion to exam initially
- Abdominal distension develops as obstruction progresses
- May present as acute small bowel obstruction without prior surgical history

**Classification:**
- Primary: torsion around mesenteric axis without adhesion/band (more common in Africa/Asia/Middle East due to high-fiber diet)
- Secondary: torsion around adhesive band, Meckel diverticulum, tumor, or malrotation
- Midgut volvulus in adults: presents with acute abdomen, may have history of recurrent vague abdominal pain (intermittent volvulus)

**Exam findings:**
- Diffuse abdominal tenderness, distension
- Absent or hyperactive bowel sounds early, then silent abdomen
- Peritoneal signs indicate bowel necrosis
- Tachycardia, hypotension, signs of sepsis in advanced cases

**In neonates/infants (midgut volvulus with malrotation):**
- Bilious vomiting in neonate = midgut volvulus until proven otherwise
- Bloody stools (late finding — indicates necrosis)

## Critical Actions

1. **Emergent surgical consultation** — this is a surgical emergency with narrow time window
2. **Aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation** — 2 L bolus isotonic crystalloid
3. **NPO, nasogastric tube to suction**
4. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics:** piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h
5. **Type and crossmatch 2-4 units PRBCs**
6. **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (adults)** — do not delay surgery for imaging if clinical picture is clear
7. **Upper GI series (neonates)** — if midgut volvulus suspected, obtain urgently
8. **Foley catheter, continuous monitoring**
9. **Correct electrolytes and acid-base abnormalities** — metabolic acidosis common

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Adhesive small bowel obstruction** — prior surgery, partial obstruction may respond to conservative management; CT shows transition point without whirl sign
- **Internal hernia** — clustered small bowel loops, mesenteric vascular engorgement on CT
- **Acute mesenteric ischemia** — pain out of proportion to exam, atrial fibrillation, SMA occlusion on CTA
- **Strangulated hernia** — palpable irreducible mass, overlying skin changes
- **Sigmoid volvulus** — large bowel distension, coffee-bean sign on X-ray
- **Intussusception** — target/doughnut sign on CT, typically colicky pain with intervals

## Workup

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (gold standard in adults):**
  - Whirl sign (mesenteric vessels spiraling around SMA axis) — pathognomonic
  - Closed-loop obstruction with C or U-shaped dilated bowel
  - Mesenteric vascular congestion/engorgement
  - Absent bowel wall enhancement = necrosis
  - Pneumatosis, portal venous gas = advanced ischemia
- **Abdominal X-ray:** dilated small bowel loops, air-fluid levels; may be nonspecific early
- **Upper GI series (neonates):** malposition of ligament of Treitz — DJ junction right of midline or corkscrew duodenum
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, lactate (elevated suggests ischemia), lipase (exclude pancreatitis), coagulation, blood gas, type and crossmatch
- **Do NOT delay surgery for imaging** if clinical deterioration

## Treatment

**Resuscitation:**
- Isotonic crystalloid 30 mL/kg initial bolus
- Correct metabolic acidosis (sodium bicarbonate 50-100 mEq IV if pH < 7.1)
- Blood product resuscitation as needed
- Vasopressors if refractory hypotension after volume

**Surgical (definitive — mandatory):**
- Emergent exploratory laparotomy
- Detorsion of volvulus, assess bowel viability
- Resection of nonviable bowel with primary anastomosis (if viable margins) or diversion
- Ladd procedure for malrotation in neonates/children (lysis of Ladd bands, counterclockwise detorsion, appendectomy, broadening of mesenteric base)
- Second-look laparotomy at 24-48 hours if bowel viability questionable at initial operation
- Damage control surgery if patient too unstable for definitive repair

**Antibiotics:**
- Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (pre- and post-operative)
- Meropenem 1 g IV q8h (alternative)
- Duration: 4-7 days for contaminated field; 24 hours prophylaxis if no perforation

## Disposition

- **Emergent OR** — no role for observation in confirmed small bowel volvulus
- **ICU post-operatively** — most patients require ICU monitoring
- **Serial lactate, CBC, BMP** post-operatively
- **Consider second-look laparotomy** at 24-48 hours if bowel viability uncertain

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating as simple SBO with conservative management.** Small bowel volvulus is a closed-loop obstruction and will NOT resolve with NG decompression. Delay in surgical intervention leads to bowel necrosis and death.

2. **Missing the whirl sign on CT.** The mesenteric whirl sign is pathognomonic but requires targeted evaluation of the mesenteric root. Communicate suspicion to the radiologist.

3. **Failure to consider midgut volvulus in adults.** Although classically a neonatal diagnosis, midgut volvulus from malrotation can present at any age. Recurrent vague abdominal pain in a patient with no prior surgery should raise suspicion.

4. **Relying on normal lactate to exclude ischemia.** Lactate may be normal in early volvulus before transmural necrosis. A normal lactate does NOT exclude the diagnosis.

5. **Bilious vomiting in a neonate dismissed as reflux.** Bilious emesis in a neonate is midgut volvulus until proven otherwise. Emergent upper GI series is mandatory.

6. **Delaying surgery for additional imaging in a deteriorating patient.** When clinical suspicion is high and the patient is deteriorating, proceed directly to OR. CT confirmation is desirable but not required.
