# Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

## Recognition

**Classic triad (present in < 50% of cases):**
1. Sudden-onset abdominal or back pain
2. Hypotension
3. Pulsatile abdominal mass

**Presentation patterns:**
- **Contained retroperitoneal rupture (most common survivors to ED):** severe constant back/flank pain, may be hemodynamically stable initially ("stable rAAA"), no peritoneal signs
- **Free intraperitoneal rupture:** rapid hemodynamic collapse, abdominal distension, peritonitis — usually fatal before arrival
- **Aortocaval fistula (rare):** high-output heart failure, lower extremity edema, machinery-like abdominal bruit, hematuria
- **Aortoenteric fistula (rare, usually secondary):** GI bleeding (herald bleed then massive hemorrhage), history of prior aortic graft

**High-risk demographics:**
- Male > 65 years, smoking history, hypertension, family history of AAA
- Known AAA under surveillance
- Connective tissue disorders (Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos)

**Commonly mimicked conditions (diagnostic delay is lethal):**
- Renal colic: flank pain, hematuria (aortocaval fistula causes microscopic hematuria)
- Musculoskeletal back pain
- Diverticulitis
- Acute MI (inferior STEMI from hypotension)
- Mesenteric ischemia

**Bedside ultrasound:**
- Sensitivity 99%, specificity 98% for detecting AAA (diameter > 3.0 cm)
- Aorta >= 5.0 cm with hypotension in an elderly patient = ruptured AAA until proven otherwise
- Free fluid in Morrison pouch or pelvis increases suspicion but is often absent in contained retroperitoneal rupture
- Ultrasound does NOT reliably visualize the rupture itself — it identifies the aneurysm; clinical context determines rupture
- A normal-caliber aorta on ultrasound effectively rules out rAAA

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Bedside aortic ultrasound | < 5 minutes from suspected diagnosis |
| Vascular surgery/OR activation | Immediate upon identification |
| Massive transfusion protocol | Activate if hemodynamically unstable |
| Permissive hypotension target | SBP 70-90 mmHg (conscious patient) |

1. **Activate vascular surgery and OR immediately.** Do NOT delay for CT if clinical diagnosis is clear (known AAA + hypotension + pain). Time to OR is the primary determinant of survival.
2. **Establish large-bore IV access:** two 14-16 gauge peripheral IVs and/or introducer sheaths (cordis). Consider bilateral antecubital or femoral access.
3. **Type and crossmatch for 10 units pRBCs.** Activate massive transfusion protocol (1:1:1 pRBC:FFP:platelets).
4. **Permissive hypotension:** target SBP 70-90 mmHg in conscious patients. Aggressive fluid resuscitation disrupts retroperitoneal tamponade, dilutes clotting factors, worsens coagulopathy, and accelerates hemorrhage.
   - Minimal crystalloid: avoid large-volume NS/LR boluses
   - Blood products are the resuscitation fluid of choice
5. **Bedside POCUS of aorta** to confirm aneurysm if diagnosis uncertain. Identify aortic diameter in transverse and longitudinal planes from subxiphoid to bifurcation.
6. **CT angiography (CTA)** ONLY if patient is hemodynamically stable, diagnosis is uncertain, and vascular surgery needs anatomic planning for EVAR. CTA provides critical information on aneurysm morphology, neck anatomy, iliac access, and renal artery involvement.
7. **Crossmatch, CBC, BMP, coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen), lactate, type and screen** — send immediately but do NOT delay OR for results.
8. **Hold anticoagulation.** Reverse any existing anticoagulation: vitamin K 10 mg IV + 4-factor PCC (25-50 units/kg IV) for warfarin; idarucizumab 5 g IV for dabigatran; andexanet alfa or 4-factor PCC for factor Xa inhibitors.
9. **Arterial line** for continuous BP monitoring (do not delay OR for placement).
10. **Foley catheter** for urine output monitoring.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Renal colic / nephrolithiasis (the most dangerous misdiagnosis — always assess aorta in elderly patients with "renal colic")
- Acute pancreatitis
- Mesenteric ischemia
- Perforated viscus
- Acute MI (especially inferior STEMI)
- Aortic dissection (may coexist; dissection extending into infrarenal aorta)
- Retroperitoneal hemorrhage from other cause (anticoagulation, tumor, renal)
- Symptomatic but unruptured AAA (pain from rapid expansion without frank rupture — still requires urgent surgical evaluation)
- Vertebral compression fracture
- Musculoskeletal back pain
- Diverticulitis

## Workup

**Immediate (do not delay intervention):**
- **Bedside aortic ultrasound:** visualize aorta from subxiphoid to bifurcation; measure AP diameter; > 3.0 cm = aneurysm, >= 5.0 cm with symptoms = emergent surgical evaluation
- **Point-of-care hemoglobin/hematocrit** (may be normal early due to acute blood loss before equilibration)
- **Type and crossmatch** for >= 6 units pRBCs
- **VBG/ABG:** pH, lactate (prognostic; lactate > 5 mmol/L associated with poor outcomes)
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen (coagulopathy common, especially with massive transfusion)

**If hemodynamically stable and diagnosis uncertain:**
- **CT angiography of abdomen/pelvis with arterial phase:** gold standard for diagnosing and characterizing rAAA; identifies rupture site, extent, renal/iliac involvement, suitability for EVAR
- Do NOT send an unstable patient to the CT scanner

**Not indicated acutely:**
- MRI (too slow, not available emergently)
- Formal aortography (supplanted by CTA)

## Treatment

### Hemodynamic Management
- **Permissive hypotension:** SBP 70-90 mmHg; do NOT target normotension
- Avoid large-volume crystalloid resuscitation — worsens coagulopathy and disrupts clot
- Transfuse pRBCs, FFP, and platelets in 1:1:1 ratio (massive transfusion protocol)
- Tranexamic acid (TXA) 1 g IV over 10 minutes (extrapolated from trauma literature; no large rAAA-specific RCT, but biologically rational to reduce fibrinolysis)
- Calcium gluconate 1-3 g IV to counter citrate-induced hypocalcemia from massive transfusion
- Vasopressors: norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV or vasopressin 0.04 units/min IV as temporizing measure — do NOT use as substitute for hemorrhage control

### Surgical Repair
**EVAR (endovascular aneurysm repair):**
- Preferred when anatomically suitable (appropriate aortic neck, iliac access)
- IMPROVE trial: EVAR associated with shorter ICU stay and cost savings vs open repair; no significant 30-day mortality difference but improved quality of life at 1 year
- Requires favorable anatomy: adequate infrarenal neck length (>= 10 mm), appropriate neck angulation, iliac access vessels >= 6 mm
- Can be performed under local anesthesia with sedation (avoids hemodynamic instability of general anesthesia induction)

**Open surgical repair:**
- Required when EVAR anatomy is unfavorable, suprarenal extension, or EVAR not available
- Midline laparotomy with aortic cross-clamp and graft interposition
- Higher physiologic insult but no anatomic restrictions
- Supraceliac aortic clamping for proximal control if infrarenal clamp cannot be applied safely

### Intraoperative Considerations (ED-relevant)
- Avoid general anesthesia induction until surgeon is scrubbed and ready — induction causes loss of sympathetic tone and precipitous cardiovascular collapse
- Blood warmer for all transfused products
- Target core temperature > 35°C (hypothermia worsens coagulopathy)
- Abdominal compartment syndrome post-repair: monitor bladder pressure; > 20 mmHg with organ dysfunction requires decompressive laparotomy

## Disposition

- **All suspected rAAA:** direct to OR (vascular surgery or interventional suite for EVAR). Do NOT admit to floor, do NOT observe in ED
- **Hemodynamically unstable with confirmed AAA:** OR immediately, no CT
- **Hemodynamically stable with confirmed AAA + pain:** CTA for surgical planning, then OR (same admission, do not discharge for outpatient follow-up)
- **Symptomatic unruptured AAA (rapidly expanding, new pain):** urgent vascular surgery consultation, admit for observation and likely operative intervention within 24 hours
- **Post-operative:** ICU admission, monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome, renal failure, lower extremity ischemia, colonic ischemia (10-15% post-open repair)
- **Transfer:** if no vascular surgery capability, activate transfer immediately; begin permissive hypotension and massive transfusion during transport

## Pitfalls

1. **Diagnosing renal colic in an elderly patient without imaging the aorta.** Any patient > 50 with new flank/back pain and risk factors for AAA requires bedside aortic ultrasound. Hematuria does not exclude rAAA (aortocaval fistula, concurrent nephrolithiasis).

2. **Sending an unstable patient to CT.** If the clinical picture is clear (known AAA + hypotension + abdominal/back pain), go directly to OR. CT delays definitive hemorrhage control and the patient may arrest in the scanner.

3. **Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation targeting normal blood pressure.** Large-volume crystalloid disrupts the retroperitoneal tamponade containing hemorrhage, dilutes clotting factors, worsens hypothermia, and accelerates bleeding. Target SBP 70-90 mmHg with blood products.

4. **Relying on an initially normal hemoglobin.** In acute hemorrhage, hemoglobin does not drop until volume equilibrates (hours). A normal Hgb does NOT exclude massive blood loss.

5. **Missing the diagnosis in women.** rAAA is less common in women but carries higher mortality. Women present with atypical symptoms more often (isolated back pain, syncope without abdominal findings). Maintain the same diagnostic approach.

6. **Delaying OR for complete workup.** Coagulation studies, renal function, and imaging are useful but not prerequisites for surgery. Send labs and proceed to OR simultaneously. The definitive treatment is surgical control of hemorrhage.

7. **Inducing general anesthesia before the surgeon is ready.** Anesthetic induction eliminates sympathetic compensation and causes precipitous cardiovascular collapse. The surgeon must be scrubbed and ready for incision before induction.

8. **Not activating massive transfusion protocol early.** rAAA patients frequently require 10+ units of pRBCs. Early MTP activation ensures product availability. Transfuse 1:1:1 (pRBC:FFP:platelets) and replace calcium aggressively.

9. **Forgetting to assess for abdominal compartment syndrome post-repair.** Massive resuscitation and retroperitoneal hematoma cause intra-abdominal hypertension. Monitor bladder pressure; > 20 mmHg with organ dysfunction (oliguria, hypotension, respiratory failure) requires decompressive laparotomy.

10. **Assuming a stable patient will remain stable.** Contained retroperitoneal rupture provides temporary tamponade. Patients can be conversant and hemodynamically stable, then decompensate within minutes as the tamponade fails. Continuous monitoring and immediate surgical readiness are mandatory.
