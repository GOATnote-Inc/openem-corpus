# Traumatic Diaphragmatic Rupture

## Recognition

**Mechanism:**
- **Blunt:** MVC (most common), fall from height, crush injury. Causes large radial tears (usually > 10 cm). Left-sided 3:1 over right (liver "protects" right hemidiaphragm).
- **Penetrating:** Stab, GSW to thoracoabdominal region (nipple line to costal margin). Causes small lacerations that may enlarge over time.

**Presentation — highly variable, often occult:**
- Dyspnea, orthopnea (worse when supine — viscera herniate further)
- Ipsilateral decreased breath sounds
- Bowel sounds in chest (pathognomonic but uncommon acutely)
- Shoulder pain (referred via phrenic nerve irritation)
- Epigastric or lower chest pain
- Scaphoid abdomen (contents displaced into chest)
- Respiratory distress disproportionate to apparent injury

**Delayed presentation (weeks to years):**
- Bowel obstruction or strangulation from chronic diaphragmatic hernia
- Incarcerated viscera with ischemia
- Respiratory compromise from progressive herniation

**Key point:** Missed in up to 66% of cases at initial presentation. High index of suspicion required for any thoracoabdominal trauma.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Chest X-ray | < 15 minutes |
| CT chest/abdomen | < 60 minutes |
| Surgical consult | < 1 hour |
| Operative repair | < 6 hours (if visceral herniation) |

1. **ATLS primary survey** — airway, breathing, circulation
2. **Chest X-ray** — first clue: elevated hemidiaphragm, gastric bubble above diaphragm, NG tube coiling in chest, obscured hemidiaphragm. Normal CXR does NOT exclude injury.
3. **Place NG/OG tube** before imaging — if tube is seen above the diaphragm on CXR, diagnostic
4. **CT chest/abdomen with IV contrast** — sensitivity 61-87% for blunt, lower for small penetrating injuries. Look for: direct diaphragm discontinuity, "dependent viscera sign" (viscera contact posterior chest wall without diaphragm interposition), collar sign (waist of herniated viscus at diaphragmatic defect)
5. **Surgical exploration** — definitive diagnosis. Diagnostic laparoscopy for left-sided penetrating injuries in stable patients (EAST guideline recommendation).

## Differential Diagnosis

- Hemothorax (fluid, not viscera above diaphragm)
- Pneumothorax (air only, no visceral contents)
- Eventration of diaphragm (congenital thinning — no acute trauma)
- Phrenic nerve palsy (elevated diaphragm but intact, no herniation)
- Gastric volvulus (can mimic or result from diaphragmatic hernia)
- Pulmonary contusion (parenchymal opacity on CXR, not visceral herniation)
- Hiatal hernia (paraesophageal, not traumatic)

## Workup

- **Chest X-ray** — sensitivity only 30-62% for blunt, lower for right-sided. Look for: viscera above diaphragm, NG tube in chest, loss of diaphragm contour, basilar opacity
- **CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast** — multiplanar reformats with coronal and sagittal reconstructions. Sensitivity 61-87% (improves with thin cuts and reformats)
- **Diagnostic laparoscopy** — recommended by EAST for stable patients with left-sided thoracoabdominal penetrating injury; sensitivity > 95%
- **FAST exam** — may show fluid but not specific for diaphragmatic injury
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, lactate, type and crossmatch, coagulation studies
- **CXR with NG tube** — diagnostic if tube seen in chest above diaphragm

## Treatment

**Immediate:**
- NG/OG tube decompression (reduces herniated gastric distension and improves ventilation)
- Tube thoracostomy (36-40 Fr) if concurrent hemothorax/pneumothorax. **Caution:** if viscera are herniated, chest tube can injure bowel — suspect if feculent drainage
- Volume resuscitation for hemorrhagic shock: balanced crystalloid, then massive transfusion protocol if indicated (1:1:1 PRBC:FFP:platelets)

**Surgical repair (definitive treatment):**
- All diaphragmatic ruptures require operative repair — they do not heal spontaneously
- **Acute (< 2 weeks):** Laparotomy preferred (allows abdominal injury survey + diaphragm repair). Primary repair with nonabsorbable suture (0 or 1-0 polypropylene) in horizontal mattress fashion.
- **Delayed/chronic (> 2 weeks):** Thoracotomy or combined thoracoabdominal approach (adhesions to thoracic structures)
- **Laparoscopic repair:** Feasible for stable patients with small defects, left-sided
- **Mesh reinforcement:** Consider for large defects (> 10 cm) where primary closure is under tension

**Damage control surgery:**
- In hemodynamically unstable patients with multiple injuries: temporary diaphragm closure with running suture, pack abdomen, return for definitive repair at relaparotomy

## Disposition

- **Admit:** All confirmed or suspected diaphragmatic injuries
- **ICU:** Hemodynamically unstable, multiple associated injuries, post-operative
- **OR:** All confirmed ruptures — timing depends on stability and associated injuries
- **Trauma surgery consult:** Mandatory for all cases
- **Transfer:** Level I/II trauma center if surgical expertise not available
- **Follow-up imaging:** CT at 3-6 months post-repair to assess for recurrence

## Pitfalls

1. **Normal chest X-ray excludes diaphragmatic rupture.** CXR sensitivity is only 30-62%. CT is better but still misses injuries. If clinical suspicion persists despite negative imaging, diagnostic laparoscopy is indicated.

2. **Missing right-sided rupture because the liver "seals" the defect.** Right-sided ruptures are less common but harder to diagnose because the liver plugs the hole initially. They present late with hepatic herniation or respiratory compromise.

3. **Placing a chest tube into herniated bowel.** If viscera are above the diaphragm and a chest tube is inserted, bowel perforation can occur. Suspect diaphragmatic hernia if chest tube drainage is feculent, bilious, or has food particles.

4. **Not exploring the diaphragm during laparotomy for penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma.** Small diaphragmatic lacerations from stab wounds may be asymptomatic initially but enlarge over months-years, causing delayed herniation and strangulation. The entire diaphragm should be inspected.

5. **Assuming stability means no surgical urgency.** Even without acute visceral strangulation, all diaphragmatic ruptures require operative repair. Herniation progressively worsens due to the transdiaphragmatic pressure gradient with every breath.

6. **Forgetting to decompress the stomach.** Herniated gastric distension compresses the ipsilateral lung and shifts the mediastinum. An NG/OG tube provides immediate symptomatic relief before definitive repair.
