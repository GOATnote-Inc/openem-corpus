# Caustic Esophageal Injury

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Oropharyngeal pain, dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling
- Chest pain (retrosternal), epigastric pain
- Stridor, hoarseness, respiratory distress (laryngeal edema, aspiration)
- Hematemesis
- Burns or erythema of lips, mouth, oropharynx (absence does NOT exclude esophageal injury — 10-30% of esophageal burns have no oral findings)

**Caustic types:**
- **Alkali (pH > 12):** most dangerous to esophagus (liquefactive necrosis — penetrates deeply); drain cleaners (NaOH), bleach (concentrated), dishwasher detergent, button batteries
- **Acid (pH < 2):** primarily injures stomach (coagulation necrosis — forms eschar limiting penetration); battery acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid
- **Oxidizing agents:** hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate — cause tissue destruction by oxygen release

**Severity correlates:**
- Intentional ingestion > accidental (larger volume, higher concentration)
- Liquid > granular (more mucosal contact)
- Volume ingested, contact time, concentration
- Absence of symptoms does NOT exclude significant injury (especially in children)

**Zargar endoscopic grading:**
- 0: normal
- 1: edema, erythema
- 2a: superficial ulceration, friability, blisters
- 2b: deep/circumferential ulceration
- 3a: focal necrosis (brown/black/grey discoloration)
- 3b: extensive necrosis

## Critical Actions

1. **Secure airway first** — intubate early if stridor, hoarseness, respiratory distress, oropharyngeal edema; direct laryngoscopy preferred; avoid nasotracheal (blind passage through injured tissue)
2. **NPO strictly** — no oral fluids, no emesis induction
3. **DO NOT induce vomiting** — re-exposure of caustic to esophageal mucosa
4. **DO NOT give activated charcoal** — ineffective, aspiration risk, obscures endoscopy
5. **DO NOT attempt neutralization** (acid for alkali or vice versa) — exothermic reaction worsens injury
6. **IV crystalloid resuscitation** — 2 L bolus if hemodynamically unstable
7. **CT neck/chest/abdomen with IV contrast** — assess transmural injury, perforation, mediastinitis (WSES: CT has replaced endoscopy as first-line in many centers)
8. **Endoscopy within 12-24 hours** (if CT not available or equivocal) — do NOT perform if suspected perforation
9. **GI and surgical consultation immediately**
10. **Poison control center notification**
11. **Psychiatry consultation** for intentional ingestion

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Esophageal foreign body** — discrete object on imaging, dysphagia; no chemical injury
- **Boerhaave syndrome** — post-emetic transmural perforation, pneumomediastinum; no ingestion history
- **Pill esophagitis** — medication-related (doxycycline, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates); milder injury, no oropharyngeal burns
- **Infectious esophagitis** — immunocompromised (Candida, HSV, CMV); gradual onset
- **Thermal burn (hot food/liquid)** — history of hot liquid ingestion; typically superficial
- **Anaphylaxis** — airway compromise but no chemical burns; urticaria, hypotension

## Workup

- **CT neck/chest/abdomen with IV contrast (first-line per WSES):**
  - Transmural necrosis: absence of post-contrast wall enhancement
  - Esophageal wall thickening, periesophageal stranding
  - Pneumomediastinum, pleural effusion, mediastinal fluid
  - Gastric wall thickening or perforation
  - Peritoneal free fluid
  - CT sensitivity for transmural necrosis > 90%
- **Endoscopy (EGD):**
  - Perform within 12-24 hours of ingestion if CT unavailable or equivocal
  - Zargar classification guides management (grade 3b → surgery)
  - Contraindicated if suspected perforation, grade 3b on prior scope, respiratory compromise
  - Do NOT advance past proximal extent of severe injury
  - Use flexible endoscope, minimal insufflation
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, hepatic panel, lipase, coagulation studies, ABG/VBG (pH, lactate), type and crossmatch
- **CXR:** pneumomediastinum, pleural effusion, aspiration
- **Laryngoscopy:** if stridor or hoarseness — assess laryngeal/supraglottic edema
- **Identify the substance:** contact Poison Control (1-800-222-1222); obtain product container if available

## Treatment

**Immediate stabilization:**
- Airway management (intubation for grade 3+ airway compromise)
- IV crystalloid resuscitation
- NPO, IV PPI: pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus then 8 mg/hr infusion
- Pain management: morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q4h PRN or fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV q1h PRN

**DO NOT:**
- Induce emesis
- Give activated charcoal
- Perform gastric lavage
- Attempt chemical neutralization
- Place NG tube blindly (risk of perforation through necrotic tissue)

**Antibiotics:**
- Not routine for all grades
- Indicated for grade 3 injury, suspected perforation, or aspiration pneumonia
- Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h or ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h

**Corticosteroids:**
- Controversial — NOT recommended routinely (no mortality benefit, increased infection risk)
- May be considered for grade 2b injury to reduce stricture formation (dexamethasone 1 mg/kg/day IV, max 40 mg/day x 3 days) — evidence weak, discuss with GI/surgery
- Contraindicated in grade 3 injury

**Surgical management (emergent):**
- Indications: transmural necrosis (grade 3b, CT showing absent wall enhancement), perforation, mediastinitis, peritonitis, hemodynamic instability despite resuscitation
- Procedure: esophagectomy with cervical esophagostomy and feeding gastrostomy/jejunostomy; may require gastrectomy if gastric necrosis
- Total gastrectomy with esophagostomy and jejunostomy if combined esophageal + gastric necrosis
- Delayed reconstruction (esophageal substitution with colon or gastric conduit) at 6-12 months

**Long-term complications:**
- Esophageal stricture (10-25% of grade 2b-3a) — develops 3-8 weeks post-injury
- Stricture management: serial endoscopic dilation starting at 3-4 weeks
- Esophageal carcinoma: 1,000-fold increased risk; lifelong endoscopic surveillance starting at 15-20 years post-injury

**Button battery ingestion (special case):**
- Immediate removal via endoscopy — generates alkaline pH at tissue interface within 15 minutes
- Honey or sucralfate in the pre-endoscopy period for esophageal button battery (age > 12 months only): honey 10 mL PO q10 min until endoscopy — shown to reduce depth of injury
- Do NOT delay endoscopy for any reason

## Disposition

- **ICU admission:** all intentional ingestions, stridor/airway compromise, grade 2b-3 injury, hemodynamic instability, any perforation
- **Admit:** all symptomatic patients, all intentional ingestions, any endoscopic or CT abnormality
- **Observation unit/short stay:** asymptomatic accidental small-volume ingestion with normal CT/endoscopy — observe 6-12 hours
- **Psychiatry consultation** mandatory for all intentional ingestions before discharge planning
- **Discharge:** ONLY asymptomatic accidental ingestion with normal evaluation; follow-up with GI in 2-4 weeks; return for any dysphagia, chest pain, fever

## Pitfalls

1. **Absence of oral burns does NOT exclude esophageal injury.** 10-30% of patients with significant esophageal burns have no oropharyngeal findings. Symptomatic patients require imaging/endoscopy regardless of oral exam.

2. **Inducing vomiting or attempting neutralization.** Both cause additional injury. Emesis re-exposes the esophagus; neutralization produces an exothermic reaction. These are the most harmful first-aid errors.

3. **Blind NG tube placement through injured esophagus.** NG tube can perforate necrotic esophageal tissue. If NG is needed, place under endoscopic guidance only.

4. **Performing endoscopy in a patient with suspected perforation.** Insufflation extends the perforation and worsens mediastinal contamination. CT is the preferred initial study; endoscopy reserved for when CT is unavailable or equivocal.

5. **Underestimating button battery ingestions.** Button batteries cause transmural esophageal injury within 2 hours of impaction. Emergent removal is mandatory. Any chest X-ray showing a coin-shaped object in the esophagus of a child must be evaluated for button battery (double-ring sign on AP view).

6. **Missing delayed stricture formation.** Strictures develop in 10-25% of grade 2b-3a injuries at 3-8 weeks. All patients with grade 2b or higher require GI follow-up for early detection and serial dilation if needed.
