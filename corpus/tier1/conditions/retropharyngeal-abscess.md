# Retropharyngeal Abscess

## Recognition

**Definition:** Suppurative infection of the retropharyngeal space (between the posterior pharyngeal wall and prevertebral fascia). Primarily a pediatric disease (<6 years) due to retropharyngeal lymph nodes that involute by age 5. In adults: IVDU, trauma, foreign body ingestion, or extension from vertebral osteomyelitis.

### Classic Presentation
- Fever, irritability, poor oral intake (pediatric)
- Neck stiffness and torticollis (meningismus mimic)
- Dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice
- Refusal to extend the neck
- Unilateral posterior pharyngeal wall swelling (visible on oropharyngeal exam — absent in up to 50%)
- Stridor or respiratory distress (late sign indicating airway compromise)

### Pediatric vs Adult Differences
| Feature | Pediatric (<6 years) | Adult |
|---|---|---|
| Etiology | URI with suppurative lymphadenitis | IVDU, trauma, foreign body, vertebral osteomyelitis |
| Typical organisms | Group A Strep, S. aureus, anaerobes | Polymicrobial, MRSA in IVDU |
| Pharyngeal bulge | Common | Less common, deeper infections |
| Airway risk | Higher (smaller airway diameter) | Lower but still present |

### Red Flags for Airway Compromise
- Stridor or stertor
- Drooling, inability to manage secretions
- Respiratory distress, tripod positioning
- Trismus (suggests lateral extension to parapharyngeal space)
- Rapid clinical deterioration

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Airway assessment | Immediately on suspicion |
| CT neck with IV contrast | Urgent — confirms diagnosis and guides drainage |
| IV antibiotics | Within 1 hour of recognition |
| ENT consultation | Immediate for surgical drainage evaluation |
| NPO status | On recognition — anticipate operative intervention |
| Avoid blind nasopharyngeal instrumentation | Risk of abscess rupture and aspiration |

1. Assess and secure airway — prepare for difficult airway with double setup (intubation + surgical airway)
2. Obtain CT neck with IV contrast (sensitivity >90% for abscess vs cellulitis/phlegmon)
3. Start IV antibiotics targeting streptococci, staphylococci, and anaerobes
4. Consult ENT for drainage of abscesses >2 cm or failed medical therapy
5. Maintain NPO status
6. Monitor for signs of airway deterioration continuously

## Differential Diagnosis

- Epiglottitis (rapid onset, supraglottic edema, thumbprint sign on lateral neck)
- Peritonsillar abscess (unilateral tonsillar swelling, uvular deviation, trismus)
- Ludwig angina (floor-of-mouth swelling, bilateral submandibular induration)
- Parapharyngeal abscess (lateral neck swelling, trismus, medial displacement of tonsil)
- Meningitis (neck stiffness, but no pharyngeal swelling, positive Kernig/Brudzinski)
- Cervical vertebral osteomyelitis (insidious onset, back pain, vertebral destruction on imaging)
- Kawasaki disease (pediatric — cervical lymphadenopathy, rash, conjunctivitis, mucosal changes)
- Infectious mononucleosis (pharyngitis, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly)
- Foreign body (sudden onset, history of ingestion event)

## Workup

- **CT neck with IV contrast:** Diagnostic standard — sensitivity >90%. Rim-enhancing hypodense collection confirms abscess. Differentiates abscess from phlegmon/cellulitis (phlegmon may respond to antibiotics alone). Evaluates extension to mediastinum and vascular structures.
- **Lateral neck X-ray (soft tissue):** Prevertebral soft tissue widening >7 mm at C2 or >14 mm at C6 (adults) / >7 mm at C2 or >14 mm at C6 (children). Sensitivity ~80%. Useful screening tool but does not replace CT. Must be obtained in extension with inspiration (flexion and crying falsely widen prevertebral space).
- **CBC with differential:** Leukocytosis with left shift
- **Blood cultures:** Obtain before antibiotics; positive in ~10-20%
- **CRP / ESR:** Elevated; useful for monitoring treatment response
- **CT angiography:** If concern for carotid artery erosion or internal jugular vein thrombosis (Lemierre syndrome)

**Do NOT obtain:** MRI in unstable patients (delays definitive management). Do NOT perform bedside needle aspiration of posterior pharyngeal wall — risk of aspiration and incomplete drainage.

## Treatment

### Airway Management
- **Stable airway:** Close monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry, airway equipment at bedside
- **Compromised airway:** Controlled intubation (awake fiber-optic preferred in adults, inhalational induction in pediatrics). Avoid blind nasotracheal intubation (risk of abscess rupture).
- **Failed intubation:** Surgical cricothyrotomy (adults) or needle cricothyrotomy (pediatrics)

### Antibiotics
- **First-line (adults):** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h
- **First-line (pediatrics):** Ampicillin-sulbactam 50 mg/kg IV q6h (based on ampicillin component, max 2 g ampicillin component per dose = 3 g combined formulation)
- **Alternative:** Clindamycin 600-900 mg IV q8h (adults) or 10-13 mg/kg IV q8h (pediatrics, max 900 mg/dose)
- **MRSA concern (IVDU, known colonization):** Add vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (adults) or 15 mg/kg IV q6h (pediatrics)
- **Mediastinal extension:** Broaden to meropenem 1 g IV q8h (adults) or 20 mg/kg IV q8h (pediatrics)
- Narrow based on operative cultures. Duration: 14-21 days total (IV until clinically improved, then oral step-down).

### Surgical Drainage
- **Indications:** Abscess >2 cm, failure to improve on 48 hours of IV antibiotics, airway compromise, extension to mediastinum
- **Approach:** Transoral incision and drainage (ENT) or transcervical approach for large or lateral collections
- Operative cultures guide antibiotic narrowing

### Adjuncts
- **IV dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg (max 10 mg) x 1 dose:** Reduces edema and may decrease airway obstruction — limited evidence but commonly used
- **IV fluid resuscitation:** Patients are often dehydrated from poor oral intake

## Disposition

- **ICU:** Airway compromise, post-operative monitoring, mediastinal extension, sepsis
- **Inpatient (floor with telemetry):** Stable patients with confirmed abscess or phlegmon on IV antibiotics, pending ENT evaluation
- **Never discharge from ED.** All confirmed retropharyngeal abscesses require admission for IV antibiotics and serial airway assessments.
- **Transfer:** If ENT not available for surgical drainage, transfer to a facility with pediatric or adult ENT coverage

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosing as simple pharyngitis or meningitis in children.** Neck stiffness and irritability overlap with meningitis. A child with neck stiffness, fever, and refusal to extend the neck warrants CT neck with contrast before lumbar puncture.

2. **Obtaining lateral neck X-ray with neck in flexion.** Flexion and crying falsely widen the prevertebral soft tissue space, producing false-positive results. Film must be obtained in extension during inspiration.

3. **Relying on lateral neck X-ray to exclude the diagnosis.** Sensitivity is ~80%. A normal X-ray does not rule out retropharyngeal abscess — CT neck with IV contrast is required when clinical suspicion is high.

4. **Failing to distinguish phlegmon from drainable abscess on CT.** Phlegmon (no rim-enhancing collection) may respond to antibiotics alone. True abscess (rim-enhancing hypodense collection) typically requires surgical drainage, especially if >2 cm.

5. **Performing blind oropharyngeal incision and drainage in the ED.** Risk of aspiration of purulent material, incomplete drainage, and vascular injury (carotid artery lies laterally). Drainage is performed by ENT in the OR under controlled conditions.

6. **Omitting anaerobic coverage.** Retropharyngeal abscesses are frequently polymicrobial including oral anaerobes. Ampicillin-sulbactam or clindamycin provide appropriate coverage; ceftriaxone alone is insufficient.

7. **Missing mediastinal extension.** Retropharyngeal space communicates with the posterior mediastinum to the level of the diaphragm. CT imaging must include the chest if mediastinal involvement is suspected. Mediastinitis carries >40% mortality.

8. **Delaying ENT consultation until CT results are available.** ENT should be notified at the time of clinical suspicion, not after imaging confirms the diagnosis. Early involvement facilitates timely drainage if needed.

9. **Failing to consider Lemierre syndrome.** Internal jugular vein thrombophlebitis from adjacent deep neck infection (typically Fusobacterium necrophorum) causes septic emboli. Evaluate for IJV thrombosis on CT; add anaerobic coverage.

10. **Discharging pediatric patients with "just a stiff neck."** In children <6 years, neck stiffness with fever and poor oral intake must prompt evaluation for retropharyngeal abscess even without visible pharyngeal swelling. Up to 50% lack a visible posterior pharyngeal bulge.
