# Drug Hypersensitivity Reaction

## Recognition

**Spectrum of Drug Hypersensitivity Reactions:**

| Type | Onset | Key Features |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Morbilliform drug eruption | 7-14 days after drug start | Symmetric, erythematous macules/papules, pruritic, trunk → extremities, no systemic toxicity. Most common drug eruption. |
| Fixed drug eruption | Hours after re-exposure | Recurrent, well-demarcated, round, dusky-red to violaceous plaques at the SAME anatomic site each exposure. May blister. |
| Erythema multiforme | 1-3 weeks | Target lesions (three-zone pattern), acral distribution (palms, soles, dorsal hands), limited mucosal involvement. Distinguish from SJS: EM has true targets, is acral; SJS has atypical targets, is truncal with mucosal necrosis. |
| DRESS syndrome | 2-8 weeks after drug initiation | Fever, facial edema (especially periorbital), diffuse maculopapular rash (>50% BSA), eosinophilia, lymphadenopathy, organ involvement |

**DRESS — The Dangerous Presentation:**
- Fever: >38.5°C, often first sign
- Rash: maculopapular, starts on face and upper trunk, spreads to >50% BSA; may become purpuric, vesicular, or exfoliative
- Facial edema: periorbital and diffuse — distinctive for DRESS
- Lymphadenopathy: generalized, nontender
- Hematologic: eosinophilia (>700/microL in 90%), atypical lymphocytes (mimics infectious mononucleosis)
- Organ involvement:
  - Hepatitis: 50-60% (elevated AST/ALT, may progress to fulminant hepatic failure)
  - Nephritis: 10-30% (elevated creatinine, proteinuria)
  - Pneumonitis: 5-25% (infiltrates on CXR, hypoxia)
  - Myocarditis: rare but fatal
  - Thyroiditis: may present weeks after resolution

**RegiSCAR Scoring Criteria for DRESS:**
- Fever ≥38.5°C
- Enlarged lymph nodes at ≥2 sites
- Eosinophilia (≥700/microL or ≥10%)
- Atypical lymphocytes
- Skin involvement >50% BSA
- Rash suggestive of DRESS (≥2 of: facial edema, purpura, infiltration, desquamation)
- Organ involvement (liver, kidney, lung, heart)
- Resolution >15 days
- Score: <2 = no case; 2-3 = possible; 4-5 = probable; >5 = definite

**Most Common Culprit Drugs:**
- Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital
- Allopurinol (highest mortality DRESS)
- Sulfonamides (TMP-SMX, dapsone, sulfasalazine)
- Vancomycin
- Dapsone
- Minocycline
- Abacavir

## Critical Actions

1. **Stop the offending drug immediately.** Identify the most likely culprit based on timing of drug initiation (2-8 weeks for DRESS; 7-14 days for morbilliform). Discontinue all nonessential medications if uncertain.
2. **Assess for DRESS vs. simple drug eruption.** Check temperature, examine for facial edema, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly. Obtain CBC with differential, CMP, and urinalysis on ALL patients with drug rash plus fever or eosinophilia.
3. **Exclude SJS/TEN.** Look for mucosal involvement (oral erosions, conjunctival injection, genital erosions), skin pain disproportionate to appearance, positive Nikolsky sign (epidermal sloughing with lateral pressure), and necrotic/dusky skin. SJS/TEN requires burn center transfer.
4. **Initiate systemic corticosteroids for DRESS.** Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day PO (or methylprednisolone equivalent IV if unable to take PO). Taper slowly over 8-12 weeks — rapid taper causes flares.
5. **Monitor organ function.** LFTs every 24-48 hours for hepatic DRESS. Creatinine for nephritis. CXR and pulse oximetry for pneumonitis. Troponin and ECG if myocarditis suspected.
6. **Dermatology consult** for all suspected DRESS, erythema multiforme major, or diagnostic uncertainty.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| SJS/TEN | Mucosal involvement (≥2 sites), skin necrosis, positive Nikolsky sign, dusky macules with epidermal detachment, skin PAIN. BSA detachment: SJS <10%, SJS-TEN overlap 10-30%, TEN >30%. |
| Viral exanthem | Symmetric, morbilliform. Prodromal URI symptoms. Lacks eosinophilia, hepatitis, facial edema. Often resolves spontaneously. |
| Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) | Rapid onset (1-5 days), hundreds of small nonfollicular pustules on erythematous base, fever, neutrophilia (NOT eosinophilia). Resolves quickly after drug withdrawal. |
| Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome | Desquamation, positive Nikolsky sign, but NO mucosal involvement. More common in children. Cleavage plane is intraepidermal (vs. dermal-epidermal in TEN). |
| Serum sickness-like reaction | Fever, arthralgias, urticaria, lymphadenopathy. 1-3 weeks after drug. No eosinophilia, no organ involvement. Cefaclor is classic culprit. |
| Kawasaki disease | Pediatric. Fever ≥5 days, conjunctivitis, oral changes, rash, extremity changes, lymphadenopathy. Coronary aneurysm risk. |
| Secondary syphilis | Diffuse maculopapular rash, palms/soles involvement, lymphadenopathy. Check RPR. |
| Acute HIV seroconversion | Fever, maculopapular rash, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy. Recent exposure history. HIV RNA viral load positive. |

## Workup

**All Suspected Drug Hypersensitivity:**
- CBC with manual differential (eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytes)
- CMP (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, creatinine, BUN)
- Urinalysis (proteinuria, hematuria for nephritis)

**Suspected DRESS — Add:**
- LDH, albumin
- ESR, CRP
- Lipase (pancreatitis)
- Troponin, ECG (myocarditis)
- CXR (pneumonitis)
- TSH (thyroiditis — may present 2-3 months after resolution; order at follow-up)
- Blood smear (atypical lymphocytes)
- Ferritin (elevated in DRESS; if markedly elevated, consider hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis)
- HHV-6 reactivation PCR (reactivated in 40-60% of DRESS; associated with more severe hepatitis)

**Skin Biopsy:**
- Not required emergently but supports diagnosis
- DRESS: perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, interface dermatitis
- EM: necrotic keratinocytes, vacuolar interface dermatitis

**Pharmacogenomic Testing (outpatient, but document in ED):**
- HLA-B*5801: test BEFORE starting allopurinol in Southeast Asian, African American, Korean populations (strong association with allopurinol DRESS and SJS/TEN)
- HLA-B*1502: test before carbamazepine in Southeast Asian populations (SJS/TEN risk)

## Treatment

**Simple Morbilliform Drug Eruption (no systemic features):**
- Stop offending drug
- Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg PO every 6 hours PRN pruritus, or hydroxyzine 25 mg PO every 6 hours
- Medium-potency topical corticosteroid (triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID to affected areas)
- Eruption resolves 1-2 weeks after drug discontinuation

**Fixed Drug Eruption:**
- Stop offending drug (permanent avoidance)
- Topical corticosteroid (clobetasol 0.05% cream BID for 1-2 weeks) if localized
- Document the culprit drug — recurrence at the same site is diagnostic

**Erythema Multiforme:**
- Stop offending drug
- Mild/localized: supportive care, topical corticosteroids
- Severe/extensive: prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day PO for 1-2 weeks with taper
- If mucosal involvement: assess for progression to SJS — ophthalmology consult if ocular involvement

**DRESS Syndrome:**
- **Stop all suspected drugs.** Drug elimination half-life matters — drugs with long half-lives (phenobarbital) cause prolonged DRESS.
- **Systemic corticosteroids:** prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day PO (or methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day IV if unable to take PO or severe organ involvement). Taper SLOWLY over 8-12 weeks minimum. Rapid taper (<6 weeks) causes relapse in >30%.
- **Hepatic DRESS (ALT >5x ULN):** methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 days (pulse therapy), then prednisone 1.5-2 mg/kg/day with slow taper
- **Refractory DRESS:** cyclosporine 3-5 mg/kg/day in divided doses (dermatology-directed). IVIG 2 g/kg over 2-5 days as alternative.
- **Supportive:** aggressive IV fluid resuscitation for insensible losses from extensive skin involvement. VTE prophylaxis. Monitor glucose on corticosteroids.

## Disposition

**Discharge (simple morbilliform eruption):**
- No fever, no eosinophilia, normal LFTs, normal creatinine
- Offending drug documented and discontinued
- Prescription for antihistamines and topical corticosteroids
- Return precautions: fever, facial swelling, oral lesions, skin pain, jaundice, dark urine
- Primary care follow-up within 1 week; allergy referral for drug challenge/testing

**Admission (DRESS, severe EM, or diagnostic uncertainty):**
- DRESS: admit for IV corticosteroids, serial organ function monitoring (LFTs every 24-48 hours), dermatology consultation
- ICU for fulminant hepatitis (INR >1.5, encephalopathy), severe pneumonitis with hypoxia, or myocarditis
- Transfer to burn center if SJS/TEN cannot be excluded and BSA involvement is progressing

**Follow-up Requirements for All Drug Hypersensitivity:**
- Allergy documentation in medical record (specific drug, reaction type)
- Patient education: lifelong avoidance of culprit drug and cross-reactive agents (aromatic anticonvulsant cross-reactivity: carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital share ~40-60% cross-reactivity)
- DRESS patients: TSH at 2-3 months post-resolution (delayed autoimmune thyroiditis)

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing DRESS to infection and continuing the offending drug.** DRESS mimics sepsis (fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, elevated LFTs, leukocytosis). The 2-8 week latency from drug initiation to DRESS onset makes the temporal association less obvious. Eosinophilia and facial edema are the distinguishing clues — infections rarely cause both.

2. **Rapid corticosteroid taper in DRESS.** Tapering prednisone over <6 weeks causes relapse in >30% of DRESS patients. The minimum taper duration is 8-12 weeks. Relapses present as recurrent fever, rash, and worsened organ involvement.

3. **Missing organ involvement in DRESS.** A patient with drug rash, fever, and eosinophilia MUST have LFTs, creatinine, and urinalysis checked. Hepatitis is present in 50-60% of DRESS and can progress to fulminant liver failure. Myocarditis is rare but lethal — check troponin and ECG.

4. **Confusing erythema multiforme with SJS/TEN.** EM has true target lesions (three concentric zones) and is acral (hands, feet, elbows, knees). SJS has atypical flat targets or macules, is truncal, has mucosal necrosis at ≥2 sites, and involves epidermal detachment. The management differs drastically: EM responds to corticosteroids; SJS/TEN requires burn center care.

5. **Not checking HLA-B*5801 before starting allopurinol.** In high-risk populations (Southeast Asian, African American, Korean patients), HLA-B*5801 prevalence is 6-8%. Testing BEFORE prescribing allopurinol prevents DRESS and SJS/TEN. The test is a one-time blood draw. Failure to test is a preventable cause of severe drug reaction.

6. **Ignoring cross-reactivity among aromatic anticonvulsants.** Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital share a 40-60% cross-reactivity rate for hypersensitivity reactions. A patient with DRESS from carbamazepine cannot safely receive phenytoin. Document cross-reactive drugs and recommend alternatives (levetiracetam, valproic acid, gabapentin).

7. **Failing to consider HHV-6 reactivation in DRESS.** HHV-6 reactivates in 40-60% of DRESS cases and is associated with more severe hepatic involvement. A persistently febrile patient with worsening liver function despite drug discontinuation and corticosteroids should have HHV-6 PCR checked. Ganciclovir may be required.

8. **Discharging DRESS patients without long-term follow-up plan.** Autoimmune thyroiditis occurs 2-3 months after DRESS resolution and is easily missed. All DRESS patients need TSH monitoring at 2 and 3 months post-discharge. Type 1 diabetes has also been reported after DRESS.

9. **Applying the Nikolsky sign incorrectly and missing SJS/TEN.** Nikolsky sign (lateral pressure on uninvolved skin causes epidermal sloughing) is specific for SJS/TEN but only 50-70% sensitive. A negative Nikolsky sign does not exclude SJS/TEN. Mucosal erosions (oral, conjunctival, genital) plus skin pain/tenderness should raise suspicion regardless.
