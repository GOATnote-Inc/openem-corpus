# Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis — Management

## Recognition

**Classification by BSA of epidermal detachment:**
- **SJS:** < 10% BSA
- **SJS-TEN overlap:** 10-30% BSA
- **TEN:** > 30% BSA

**Presentation:**
- Prodrome: Fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia (1-3 days before rash)
- Skin: Painful erythema → atypical flat target lesions on trunk → coalescent → epidermal detachment → full-thickness skin sloughing
- Nikolsky sign positive (tangential pressure on normal-appearing skin causes detachment)
- Mucosal involvement (> 90%): Oral erosions, conjunctivitis/corneal erosions, genital ulceration, respiratory mucosa
- Appearance of "wet burned" skin when large sheets detach

**Common causative drugs (onset 1-3 weeks after initiation):**
- Sulfonamides (TMP-SMX most common)
- Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine, phenobarbital)
- Allopurinol
- NSAIDs (piroxicam, oxicam class)
- Nevirapine
- Antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins)

**SCORTEN Severity Score (calculate within 24 hours):**
- Age > 40 years (+1)
- Malignancy (+1)
- Heart rate > 120 (+1)
- Initial BSA of epidermal detachment > 10% (+1)
- Serum BUN > 28 mg/dL (+1)
- Serum glucose > 252 mg/dL (+1)
- Serum bicarbonate < 20 mEq/L (+1)
- Mortality: 0-1 = 3%, 2 = 12%, 3 = 35%, 4 = 58%, >= 5 = 90%

## Critical Actions

1. **Identify and STOP the causative drug immediately** — reducing mortality from 26% to 5% when drugs with short half-lives are stopped on the day blisters appear
2. **Transfer to burn center or ICU** with wound management expertise — mortality is significantly lower at burn centers
3. **Calculate SCORTEN within first 24 hours** — guides prognosis and goals-of-care conversations
4. **Assess mucosal involvement** — oral, ocular, genital, respiratory
5. **Ophthalmology consultation urgently** — corneal involvement can cause permanent blindness
6. **IV fluid resuscitation** — less than burns (use 2/3 of Parkland formula as starting point)
7. **Avoid unnecessary medications** — stop ALL non-essential drugs

## Differential Diagnosis

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome — same disease spectrum; < 10% BSA detachment
- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) — infants/children, intertriginous areas, superficial split (no mucosal involvement), positive Staph cultures; histology distinguishes (subcorneal split in SSSS vs full-thickness epidermal necrosis in TEN)
- Burns — history of thermal/chemical exposure
- Pemphigus vulgaris — chronic, flaccid blisters, no drug trigger
- Generalized bullous fixed drug eruption — recurrent at same sites
- Acute graft-versus-host disease — post-transplant
- Erythema multiforme major — raised typical targets, acral predominance
- Paraneoplastic pemphigus — associated with malignancy, polymorphous lesions

## Workup

- **Skin biopsy** — full-thickness epidermal necrosis with subepidermal cleavage; sparse dermal lymphocytic infiltrate; frozen section can provide rapid results
- **SCORTEN calculation** at admission and 72 hours
- **CBC with differential** — neutropenia may develop (poor prognostic marker)
- **BMP:** BUN, creatinine, glucose, electrolytes, bicarbonate (needed for SCORTEN)
- **Hepatic panel** — drug-induced liver injury may coexist
- **Albumin** — protein losses through denuded skin
- **Blood cultures** if febrile (high risk of bacterial superinfection)
- **Wound cultures** — from denuded areas
- **Coagulation studies** — DIC screening
- **Urinalysis** — if genital mucosal involvement
- **CXR** — baseline; monitor for pulmonary involvement
- **Drug causality assessment** — ALDEN algorithm for systematic drug attribution

## Treatment

### General Principles
- **Stop ALL suspect drugs immediately** — this is the single most impactful intervention
- **Burn center or ICU care** in a unit experienced with wound management
- **Temperature:** Maintain ambient temperature 28-32°C (patients are poikilothermic)
- **Reverse isolation** — protect immunocompromised skin from environmental contamination

### Fluid and Nutritional Management
- Fluid replacement: Start at 2/3 of Parkland formula (less than thermal burns due to less inflammatory third-spacing)
- Titrate to urine output 0.5-1 mL/kg/hr
- Albumin replacement if serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL
- NG tube feeding initiated early if > 20% BSA involvement or unable to take PO
- High-protein, high-calorie nutritional support (1.5-2x estimated requirements)

### Wound Care
- **Leave detached epidermis in place** where possible — acts as a biologic dressing (unlike burns, TEN skin cells may retain some viability)
- If epidermis must be removed: biosynthetic dressings (Biobrane), non-adherent petrolatum gauze, or silicone dressings
- Silver sulfadiazine is CONTROVERSIAL in TEN — some experts avoid due to potential sulfonamide sensitivity (if sulfa was the trigger)
- **No prophylactic debridement** — not shown to improve outcomes
- Gentle wound cleansing with sterile saline
- Change dressings minimally (every 24-48h) to avoid repeated trauma

### Mucosal Care
- **Oral:** Chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash BID, viscous lidocaine 2%, soft/liquid diet
- **Ocular:** Ophthalmology consultation mandatory; preservative-free artificial tears q1-2h, topical antibiotics (erythromycin ophthalmic ointment), amniotic membrane transplant for severe corneal involvement, lysis of synechiae daily
- **Genital:** Topical estrogen cream (women), gentle hygiene, Foley catheter if urethral involvement
- **Respiratory:** Humidified O2, monitor for tracheobronchial sloughing (bronchoscopy if respiratory distress)

### Immunomodulatory Therapy (Controversial, No Single Standard)
- **Cyclosporine 3-5 mg/kg/day PO/IV** divided BID — strongest emerging evidence for reduced mortality and faster re-epithelialization (2024 S3 guideline conditionally recommended)
- **IVIG 2-4 g/kg IV** divided over 3-5 days — theoretical anti-Fas mechanism; mixed evidence
- **Corticosteroids:** Controversial; short-course pulse methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg/day x 3-5 days in early disease advocated by some; avoid prolonged courses (increase infection risk)
- **Etanercept 50 mg SC x 1** — TNF-alpha inhibition; case series show promise
- **Combination therapy:** Cyclosporine + short-course corticosteroids used at some expert centers

### Infection Surveillance
- No prophylactic systemic antibiotics (increases resistance without proven benefit)
- Monitor wound cultures, blood cultures, temperature trends
- Start antibiotics only for documented infection (temperature instability, positive cultures, new organ dysfunction)

### Pain Management
- Acetaminophen 1000 mg IV q6h (avoid NSAIDs — may be causative drug class)
- Fentanyl 25-100 mcg IV PRN or morphine 2-4 mg IV q4h
- Ketamine sub-dissociative (0.1-0.3 mg/kg IV) for dressing changes
- Gabapentin 300-600 mg PO TID for neuropathic component

### VTE Prophylaxis
- Enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily (unless active bleeding or severe thrombocytopenia)

## Disposition

- **All TEN patients:** Burn center ICU or equivalent; multidisciplinary team (dermatology, ophthalmology, critical care, burns surgery, nutrition)
- **Transfer to burn center** if not already at one — TEN patients managed at burn centers have lower mortality
- **Average hospital stay:** 2-4 weeks
- **Long-term complications:** Ocular scarring (symblepharon, dry eye, corneal opacification), pigmentary changes, mucosal strictures (esophageal, genitourinary), chronic pain, PTSD
- **Drug documentation:** The causative drug must be PERMANENTLY documented in the allergy record — re-exposure carries 90% recurrence rate with higher severity
- **Isolation:** Reverse/protective isolation to prevent secondary infection
- **Reportable:** Not a reportable disease; however, adverse drug reactions should be reported to FDA MedWatch

## Pitfalls

1. **Not stopping the causative drug immediately.** Mortality drops from 26% to 5% when drugs with short half-lives are stopped on the day blisters first appear. Every additional day of exposure worsens prognosis. Stop ALL suspect drugs.

2. **Managing TEN on a general medical ward.** TEN mortality at burn centers is significantly lower than at general hospitals. Transfer to a burn center should be initiated as soon as TEN is suspected.

3. **Confusing TEN with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS).** SSSS has a SUPERFICIAL split (subcorneal) with NO mucosal involvement and responds to anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. TEN has FULL-THICKNESS epidermal necrosis with mucosal involvement. Frozen section biopsy differentiates within 30 minutes.

4. **Aggressive wound debridement.** Unlike thermal burns, the detached epidermis in TEN may retain some viability and acts as a biologic dressing. Prophylactic debridement has not been shown to improve outcomes and may worsen them.

5. **Not consulting ophthalmology.** Ocular complications occur in > 50% of TEN cases. Without aggressive early ocular care (artificial tears, symblepharon lysis, amniotic membrane transplantation), patients develop permanent corneal scarring and vision loss.

6. **Using prophylactic systemic antibiotics.** No evidence supports prophylactic antibiotics in TEN. They promote resistant organisms and may obscure the clinical picture. Treat only documented infections.

7. **Not documenting the causative drug as a permanent allergy.** Re-exposure to the causative drug causes recurrence with higher severity and mortality. The drug must be permanently flagged in all medical records, and the patient must be counseled to avoid it and related compounds.
