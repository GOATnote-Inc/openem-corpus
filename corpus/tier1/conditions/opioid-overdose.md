# Opioid Overdose

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Opioids bind mu-receptors in the brainstem respiratory centers, suppressing ventilatory drive. Death occurs from respiratory depression leading to hypoxia, hypercarbia, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest. CNS depression compounds the risk via loss of airway protective reflexes and aspiration.

**Classic Toxidrome (Opioid Triad):**
- Miosis (pinpoint pupils)
- Respiratory depression (RR < 12, shallow breathing, apnea)
- CNS depression (somnolence to coma)

**Additional Findings:**
- Hypotension, bradycardia
- Hypothermia
- Decreased bowel sounds
- Needle track marks, nasal erosions (route-dependent)
- Pulmonary edema (non-cardiogenic — common with heroin, methadone)
- Compartment syndrome (prolonged immobilization in obtunded state)

**High-Risk Agents:**
- **Illicit fentanyl and analogs (carfentanil):** Extreme potency, rapid onset, short duration but may require repeated/prolonged naloxone dosing. Contamination of non-opioid drug supply (cocaine, methamphetamine, counterfeit pills).
- **Methadone:** Long half-life (15-60 hours), QTc prolongation, delayed and prolonged toxicity
- **Extended-release formulations:** Sustained absorption requires prolonged monitoring and repeated naloxone
- **Heroin:** Rapid onset IV/inhaled, often mixed with fentanyl
- **Buprenorphine:** Partial agonist, high receptor affinity — resistant to standard naloxone doses

**Complications:**
- Aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia
- Rhabdomyolysis from prolonged immobilization
- Anoxic brain injury
- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE)
- Compartment syndrome

## Critical Actions

1. **Open airway and ventilate** — jaw thrust, bag-valve-mask ventilation with 100% O2. Airway management takes priority over naloxone. Provide rescue breaths for apnea.
2. **Naloxone 0.4 mg IV/IM/IN** — titrate to restore adequate respirations (RR >12), NOT full consciousness. Repeat every 2-3 minutes as needed. For complete apnea or cardiac arrest: naloxone 2 mg IV. Intranasal: 4 mg (one spray, single nostril).
3. **Monitor for re-sedation** — naloxone half-life is 30-90 minutes; most opioids outlast it. Repeat dosing or continuous infusion (2/3 of the effective bolus dose per hour) for long-acting opioids.
4. **Intubate if no response to naloxone** after cumulative dose of 10 mg — reconsider the diagnosis or suspect non-opioid co-ingestion.
5. **Obtain ECG** — methadone causes QTc prolongation (risk of torsades de pointes). Tramadol causes seizures.
6. **Check glucose** — hypoglycemia mimics opioid-induced AMS. Dextrose 25g IV (D50W 50 mL) if fingerstick glucose <60 mg/dL.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Benzodiazepine overdose | Respiratory depression with normal pupils, no response to naloxone, responds to flumazenil (use cautiously) |
| Clonidine/central alpha-agonist toxicity | Miosis, bradycardia, hypotension, but less respiratory depression; responds variably to naloxone |
| Organophosphate poisoning | Miosis with DUMBBBELS toxidrome — secretions, fasciculations, diarrhea (cholinergic excess) |
| Pontine hemorrhage | Pinpoint pupils, posturing, abnormal CT head, no response to naloxone |
| Hypoglycemia | AMS, diaphoresis, tachycardia, responds to dextrose |
| Carbon monoxide poisoning | AMS with normal or dilated pupils, cherry-red skin, elevated carboxyhemoglobin |
| Sedative-hypnotic overdose | Respiratory depression, hypothermia, but normal pupils; may be mixed with opioids |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- POC glucose — exclude hypoglycemia immediately
- ABG/VBG — respiratory acidosis (elevated pCO2), hypoxia
- BMP — renal function, electrolytes
- CBC — baseline
- CK, urinalysis for myoglobin — rhabdomyolysis from prolonged immobilization
- Hepatic panel — parenteral drug users at risk for hepatitis
- Lactate — hypoperfusion marker
- Urine drug screen — confirms opioid class but does NOT detect synthetic fentanyl on standard immunoassay. A negative UDS does not exclude opioid overdose.
- Acetaminophen and salicylate levels — co-ingestion screen (many opioid pills contain APAP)
- Ethanol level — common co-ingestant
- Pregnancy test

**ECG:**
- QTc prolongation: methadone, loperamide overdose
- Brugada pattern: loperamide toxicity
- Widened QRS: tramadol, propoxyphene, loperamide

**Imaging:**
- CXR — non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia
- CT head — if no response to naloxone or focal neurological deficits (rule out intracranial pathology)
- Extremity compartment pressures — if concerned for compartment syndrome after prolonged immobilization

## Treatment

**Airway and Breathing (Priority 1):**
- Position: recovery position if breathing adequately
- BVM ventilation with 100% O2 for apnea or RR < 8
- Oral/nasal airway adjuncts as needed
- Suction for vomiting or secretions
- Endotracheal intubation for: failure to respond to naloxone, inability to protect airway, persistent apnea

**Naloxone Administration:**
- IV: 0.4 mg, repeat every 2-3 minutes. Start with 0.04 mg in known opioid-dependent patients to avoid precipitating severe withdrawal.
- IM: 0.4 mg deltoid or anterolateral thigh
- IN: 4 mg (single nostril spray)
- Titrate to respiratory rate >12 and adequate SpO2. Full arousal is NOT the goal — precipitating acute withdrawal causes vomiting (aspiration risk), agitation, and patient elopement.
- Total dose: if no response after 10 mg cumulative IV naloxone, opioids are unlikely the primary cause. Reassess diagnosis.
- Naloxone infusion: 2/3 of the effective bolus dose per hour in D5W for sustained reversal of long-acting opioids

**Long-Acting Opioid Overdose (methadone, extended-release):**
- Prolonged monitoring (minimum 24 hours for methadone)
- Naloxone infusion often required for 12-24+ hours
- Methadone: monitor QTc — magnesium 2g IV if QTc > 500 ms

**Non-Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema:**
- Supportive care: supplemental O2, CPAP/BiPAP, or mechanical ventilation
- Diuretics are NOT effective (not cardiogenic)
- Typically resolves within 24-48 hours with supportive care

**Post-Resuscitation:**
- Initiate medications for opioid use disorder in the ED: buprenorphine 4 mg SL (can start once in mild-moderate withdrawal, COWS score >=8)
- Naltrexone is NOT appropriate in the acute setting (precipitates withdrawal)
- Harm reduction: prescribe or provide naloxone kit at discharge (naloxone 4 mg IN x2 doses)

## Disposition

**Admit to ICU:**
- Requiring naloxone infusion
- Persistent respiratory failure or need for mechanical ventilation
- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema
- Cardiac arrest survivors
- QTc > 500 ms (methadone)
- Anoxic brain injury

**Observation (minimum 4-6 hours after last naloxone dose):**
- Responded to single naloxone bolus with short-acting opioid (heroin, oxycodone IR)
- No recurrence of respiratory depression
- Stable hemodynamics and mental status

**Extended Observation (12-24+ hours):**
- Long-acting opioid ingestion (methadone, extended-release formulations)
- Body-packing/stuffing suspected
- Required multiple naloxone doses

**Discharge Criteria:**
- Minimum 4-6 hours after last naloxone dose without recurrence
- RR >12, SpO2 >95% on room air, GCS 15
- Ambulatory without ataxia
- Prescribe/provide take-home naloxone
- Provide addiction medicine referral and harm reduction resources
- Psychiatric evaluation if intentional overdose

## Pitfalls

1. **Withholding BVM ventilation while waiting for naloxone.** Opioid overdose death is from hypoxia. Ventilate first, naloxone second. Bag-valve-mask ventilation is the life-saving intervention.

2. **Giving full-dose naloxone to opioid-dependent patients.** Acute withdrawal causes projectile vomiting (aspiration risk), severe agitation, tachycardia, and hypertension. In known dependent patients, start with naloxone 0.04 mg IV and titrate. The goal is respiratory rate >12, not full consciousness.

3. **Discharging too early after single-dose naloxone.** Naloxone half-life (30-90 min) is shorter than most opioids. Re-sedation and respiratory arrest occur after discharge. Observe minimum 4-6 hours after last naloxone dose; longer for methadone/extended-release.

4. **Negative urine drug screen excluding opioid overdose.** Standard immunoassay UDS does NOT detect synthetic fentanyl, carfentanil, or many novel synthetic opioids. Clinical diagnosis (miosis + respiratory depression + response to naloxone) trumps UDS.

5. **Failing to check for co-ingestants.** Combined opioid-benzodiazepine or opioid-alcohol overdose is common and increases mortality. Screen for acetaminophen (many combination pills), benzodiazepines, and ethanol.

6. **Not checking CK for rhabdomyolysis.** Patients found down for prolonged periods develop crush injury from immobilization. CK >5000 with dark urine requires aggressive IV hydration (NS 200-300 mL/hr targeting UOP 200-300 mL/hr) to prevent renal failure.

7. **Assuming no response to naloxone means the diagnosis is wrong.** Massive fentanyl/carfentanil overdose or body-packing may require 10+ mg naloxone. Ventilatory support is the bridge.

8. **Missing non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.** Occurs in up to 2-4% of heroin overdoses. Frothy pink sputum, bilateral infiltrates on CXR, hypoxia. Diuretics do not help — this is a capillary leak phenomenon. Treat with positive-pressure ventilation.

9. **Not initiating buprenorphine or providing naloxone at discharge.** ED-initiated buprenorphine doubles 30-day addiction treatment engagement (D'Onofrio, JAMA 2015). Discharge naloxone kits prevent subsequent overdose death. Every opioid overdose patient is a candidate for these interventions.
