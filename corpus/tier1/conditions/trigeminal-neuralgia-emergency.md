# Trigeminal Neuralgia - Acute Exacerbation

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Severe, unilateral, lancinating/electric shock-like facial pain in trigeminal nerve distribution
- V2 (maxillary) and V3 (mandibular) divisions most common; V1 (ophthalmic) rare
- Episodes last seconds to 2 minutes; may cluster into volleys lasting hours
- Triggered by light touch, chewing, speaking, brushing teeth, wind on face, shaving
- Pain-free intervals between paroxysms (distinguishes from other facial pain)

**Emergency presentation (acute exacerbation / "status trigeminus"):**
- Continuous or near-continuous paroxysms of severe pain
- Inability to eat, drink, or take oral medications
- Dehydration from refusal of oral intake
- Suicidal ideation (historically called "the suicide disease")
- Medication failure or toxicity (carbamazepine overdose or hyponatremia)

**Red flags suggesting secondary TN:**
- Age < 40 years (higher risk of MS or structural lesion)
- Bilateral trigeminal neuralgia (MS, brainstem lesion)
- Sensory loss in trigeminal distribution (mass lesion, not classic TN)
- V1 involvement (higher association with secondary causes)
- Hearing loss, ataxia, other cranial nerve deficits (CPA tumor)

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess for suicidal ideation** — direct questioning; psychiatric consultation if positive
2. **Establish IV access and correct dehydration** — patients often unable to drink
3. **IV fosphenytoin 15-20 mg PE/kg IV at 100-150 mg PE/min** — most evidence-supported acute parenteral therapy; cardiac monitoring required
4. **If fosphenytoin unavailable: lidocaine 1-3 mg/kg IV over 20 min** — second-line; continuous cardiac monitoring mandatory
5. **BMP** — check sodium (carbamazepine causes SIADH/hyponatremia); check carbamazepine level if applicable
6. **MRI brain with trigeminal protocol** — outpatient if first presentation; urgent if red flags

## Differential Diagnosis

- Dental pathology (caries, abscess, cracked tooth — examine oral cavity)
- Temporomandibular joint disorder (jaw pain, clicking, tenderness over TMJ)
- Cluster headache (periorbital, autonomic features: tearing, rhinorrhea, Horner)
- Postherpetic neuralgia (prior zoster in V1 distribution, continuous burning pain)
- Multiple sclerosis (bilateral TN, age < 40, other neurologic symptoms)
- Cerebellopontine angle tumor (progressive sensory loss, hearing loss)
- Giant cell arteritis (age > 50, jaw claudication, elevated ESR)
- SUNCT/SUNA syndrome (short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing)
- Acute sinusitis (V2 distribution pain with congestion, fever)
- Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (throat/ear pain triggered by swallowing)

## Workup

- **BMP:** sodium (carbamazepine-induced hyponatremia), renal function
- **Carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine level** if patient on these medications
- **CBC** — carbamazepine causes aplastic anemia/agranulocytosis (rare but serious)
- **LFTs** — carbamazepine hepatotoxicity
- **ESR, CRP** if GCA suspected (age > 50)
- **MRI brain with trigeminal protocol** (thin-cut CISS/FIESTA sequences through posterior fossa) — identifies neurovascular compression, MS plaques, CPA tumors
- **Dental exam** — exclude dental pathology

## Treatment

### Acute Pain Abortive (ED)
- **Fosphenytoin** 15-20 mg PE/kg IV at 100-150 mg PE/min — most studied parenteral agent; cardiac monitoring required; onset 30-60 min
- **IV lidocaine** 1-3 mg/kg IV over 20 min — continuous cardiac monitoring; effective in case series; contraindicated in heart block
- **Lidocaine 4-8% topical** applied to trigger zone (nasal mucosa, gingiva) — rapid onset, limited duration
- **Sumatriptan** 6 mg SQ — emerging evidence; limited data
- Opioids are ineffective for neuropathic pain — avoid

### Initiation/Optimization of Oral Therapy
- **Carbamazepine** 100-200 mg PO BID, titrate by 100-200 mg q3 days to 400-1200 mg/day — first-line; 70% response rate
- **Oxcarbazepine** 300 mg PO BID, titrate to 600-1800 mg/day — better tolerated than carbamazepine; first-line alternative
- **Baclofen** 5 mg PO TID, titrate to 60-80 mg/day — adjunctive or for patients intolerant of carbamazepine
- **Lamotrigine** 25 mg PO daily, titrate slowly to 200-400 mg/day — slow titration due to SJS risk
- **Gabapentin** 300 mg PO TID, titrate to 1800-3600 mg/day — third-line

### Refractory Pain (Neurology/Neurosurgery Referral)
- Microvascular decompression (MVD) — definitive surgical option; 80-90% long-term relief
- Gamma knife radiosurgery — non-invasive; delayed onset of relief (weeks-months)
- Percutaneous rhizotomy (balloon compression, radiofrequency, glycerol injection)

## Disposition

- **Admit:** unable to take oral medications, severe dehydration, suicidal ideation, medication toxicity (hyponatremia, hepatotoxicity), need for IV fosphenytoin/lidocaine infusion
- **Discharge:** pain controlled with oral medications, able to tolerate PO, no suicidality, reliable follow-up
- **All patients:** neurology referral; neurosurgery referral if refractory to 2 oral agents
- **Discharge medications:** carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine with clear titration schedule, follow-up labs (Na, CBC, LFTs) in 1-2 weeks

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating with opioids.** Opioids are ineffective for trigeminal neuralgia and other neuropathic pain. They expose patients to addiction risk without benefit. Carbamazepine/oxcarbazepine are the correct treatment.

2. **Missing secondary causes.** Age < 40, bilateral symptoms, sensory loss, or other cranial nerve deficits mandate MRI. MS is the most common secondary cause; CPA tumors (acoustic neuroma, meningioma) are the most dangerous.

3. **Not checking sodium in patients on carbamazepine.** Carbamazepine causes SIADH with severe hyponatremia. A patient presenting with worsening symptoms may have carbamazepine-induced hyponatremia as the actual emergency.

4. **Not screening for suicidality.** Trigeminal neuralgia pain is among the most severe known. "Suicide disease" is the historical name. Direct screening for suicidal ideation is mandatory.

5. **Discharging without a clear oral titration plan.** Carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine require gradual dose titration with lab monitoring. Patients discharged without written instructions and follow-up labs risk medication toxicity.
