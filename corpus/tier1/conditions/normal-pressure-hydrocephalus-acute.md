# Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus - Acute Decompensation

## Recognition

**Classic triad (Hakim-Adams):**
- Gait disturbance (magnetic/apraxic gait, wide-based, shuffling) — earliest and most responsive to treatment
- Urinary incontinence (urgency progressing to incontinence)
- Cognitive impairment (subcortical dementia: psychomotor slowing, apathy, inattention)
- Mnemonic: "Wet, Wacky, and Wobbly"

**Emergency presentations:**
- Acute deterioration of mental status in known NPH patient (shunt malfunction)
- Falls with traumatic injury due to gait instability
- Acute obstructive hydrocephalus from shunt failure: headache, vomiting, obtundation, Cushing triad
- New-onset seizures
- Subdural hematoma or hygroma (over-drainage complication)

**Shunt malfunction signs:**
- Return or worsening of baseline symptoms (gait, cognition, incontinence)
- Headache (positional: worse upright = over-drainage; worse supine = obstruction)
- Nausea, vomiting, papilledema (acute obstruction)
- Altered mental status, lethargy progressing to coma

## Critical Actions

1. **CT head without contrast** — assess ventricular size; compare to prior imaging if available
2. **Shunt series X-rays** (AP skull, chest, abdomen) if VP shunt present — evaluate for disconnection, migration, kinking
3. **Neurosurgery consultation** for suspected shunt malfunction
4. **If acute obstructive hydrocephalus with deterioration:** emergent external ventricular drain (EVD) placement or shunt tap
5. **Manage raised ICP:** HOB 30 degrees, avoid hyperthermia, mannitol 1 g/kg IV if acute herniation signs
6. **Assess for subdural collections** (over-drainage complication)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Alzheimer disease (cortical dementia pattern, no gait predominance, no response to drainage)
- Parkinson disease (resting tremor, rigidity, medication-responsive)
- Vascular dementia (stepwise decline, vascular risk factors, white matter changes)
- Subdural hematoma (from over-drainage or falls; crescent on CT)
- Shunt infection (fever, meningismus, elevated WBC, CSF analysis)
- Obstructive hydrocephalus from other causes (tumor, hemorrhage, infection)
- Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (gait disturbance + upper extremity weakness)
- Lewy body dementia (visual hallucinations, fluctuations, parkinsonism)

## Workup

- **CT head** — ventricular size (Evans index > 0.3 = ventriculomegaly); compare to prior scans
- **Shunt series X-rays** — discontinuity, migration, distal catheter position
- **CBC, BMP, urinalysis** — infection screen
- **Shunt tap** (by neurosurgery): measure ICP, obtain CSF for cell count, glucose, protein, culture; opening pressure may be "normal" (< 18 cmH2O) even in malfunction
- **MRI brain** if available: disproportionate ventriculomegaly relative to sulcal enlargement (DESH pattern), periventricular T2 signal, callosal angle < 90 degrees
- **LP with high-volume CSF drainage** (30-50 mL) — diagnostic trial in unshunted patients: improvement in gait within 24-48 hours supports NPH diagnosis

## Treatment

### Shunt Malfunction
- Emergent shunt revision by neurosurgery
- EVD placement if acute decompensation with herniation risk
- Shunt tap: diagnostic and temporizing (remove 15-30 mL CSF to relieve pressure)

### Shunt Infection
- Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h (or meropenem 2 g IV q8h)
- Shunt externalization or removal by neurosurgery
- CSF cultures guide definitive antibiotic therapy

### Over-Drainage / Subdural Collections
- Small, asymptomatic subdural hygromas: observe
- Symptomatic subdural hematoma: surgical evacuation (burr hole or craniotomy)
- Shunt reprogramming to higher pressure setting (programmable valves)
- Flat positioning (Trendelenburg) for symptomatic over-drainage

### Medical Management (Unshunted NPH)
- Acetazolamide 250 mg PO BID — temporizing; reduces CSF production
- Serial large-volume LPs (30-50 mL) as bridge to shunt
- Definitive treatment: VP shunt placement (neurosurgery)

## Disposition

- **Acute shunt malfunction with altered mental status:** ICU, emergent neurosurgery
- **Shunt infection:** admission for IV antibiotics + neurosurgery
- **Stable known NPH with worsening symptoms:** neurosurgery consultation, may admit for workup
- **New suspected NPH (non-acute):** outpatient neurology/neurosurgery referral with gait assessment trial
- **Subdural collection requiring evacuation:** neurosurgical admission

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming normal opening pressure on LP excludes the diagnosis.** "Normal pressure" hydrocephalus can have intermittently elevated ICP. The name is a misnomer; the key is ventriculomegaly with clinical triad.

2. **Missing shunt malfunction in patients with nonspecific complaints.** Shunt failure often presents subtly with gradual cognitive decline, gait worsening, or personality change rather than acute headache/vomiting.

3. **Not comparing CT to prior imaging.** Ventricular size must be compared to baseline. Ventricles that are "normal" on the current scan may represent significant interval change from a prior shunted state.

4. **Attributing symptoms to dementia or aging.** NPH is one of the few reversible causes of dementia. The triad of gait disturbance, incontinence, and cognitive decline in an elderly patient warrants imaging.

5. **Forgetting to obtain a shunt series.** Disconnection or migration of shunt tubing is easily identified on plain radiographs but cannot be seen on CT. This is a required step in the shunt malfunction workup.
