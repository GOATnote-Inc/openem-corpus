# Peripartum Cardiomyopathy

## Recognition

**Definition:** Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is idiopathic systolic heart failure developing in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum, with left ventricular ejection fraction <45%, in the absence of another identifiable cause of heart failure.

**Diagnostic Criteria (ESC 2010/2019):**
1. Heart failure occurring in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum
2. LVEF <45% on echocardiography (with or without LV dilation)
3. No identifiable cause of heart failure (no prior cardiac disease, no valvular disease, no myocarditis on biopsy that explains the presentation)

**Key Epidemiological Features:**
- Incidence: 1 in 1,000–4,000 live births in the US; 1 in 100 in sub-Saharan Africa (highest incidence globally)
- Risk factors: multiparity, advanced maternal age (>30 years), African ancestry, multiple gestation, preeclampsia, hypertension, cocaine use, selenium deficiency
- Pathophysiology: prolactin-derived 16-kDa antiangiogenic fragment cleaved by cathepsin D — causes endothelial dysfunction and cardiomyocyte apoptosis
- Recovery: ~50% recover LVEF to ≥50% within 6 months; ~25% progress to end-stage heart failure requiring transplant; ~25% have persistent LV dysfunction

**Presenting Signs and Symptoms:**

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Dyspnea on exertion, progressing to rest** | Most common symptom; present in >90%; frequently misattributed to normal pregnancy |
| **Orthopnea** | Inability to lie flat; highly specific for heart failure in a peripartum woman |
| **Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea** | Awakening from sleep with acute breathlessness |
| **Lower extremity edema** | Common in normal pregnancy — alone is insufficient to diagnose PPCM, but bilateral pitting edema with dyspnea is concerning |
| **Fatigue** | Nearly universal and overlaps with normal peripartum state — not useful alone |
| **New S3 gallop** | Pathognomonic for volume overload / systolic dysfunction; any new S3 in a peripartum woman requires echo |
| **Displaced PMI** | Lateral displacement of point of maximal impulse indicates cardiomegaly |
| **Rales** | Bilateral basilar crackles from pulmonary edema |
| **Elevated JVP** | Present in decompensated right heart failure |
| **Palpitations / arrhythmia** | Atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmias; increased risk in dilated cardiomyopathy |

**Red Flags for Decompensation:**
- SpO2 <90% at rest
- HR >120 bpm at rest
- BP <90 mmHg systolic
- Altered mental status
- New arrhythmia (AF, VT)

## Critical Actions

1. **Obtain 12-lead ECG, portable CXR, and point-of-care BNP or NT-proBNP simultaneously.** Do not wait for formal echocardiography before initiating diuresis in a patient with obvious pulmonary edema. BNP >100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP >300 pg/mL in a peripartum woman requires immediate echocardiography.

2. **Urgent cardiology and OB/MFM consultation.** PPCM management requires multidisciplinary care. Cardiology for heart failure management; OB/MFM if antepartum for fetal monitoring and delivery planning.

3. **Echocardiography** as soon as possible. Confirms diagnosis, quantifies LVEF, identifies LV thrombus (present in up to 17% when EF <30%), guides treatment intensity.

4. **Diuresis for pulmonary edema.** Furosemide 20–40 mg IV. Repeat 40–80 mg IV in 1 hour if inadequate diuresis (urine output <0.5 mL/kg/hr). Reduce preload without overcorrecting volume in antepartum patients (risk of placental hypoperfusion).

5. **Vasodilators.** Hydralazine 10–25 mg PO q6–8h (safe in pregnancy) plus nitrates 0.5 mg SL PRN for acute dyspnea; isosorbide dinitrate 20–40 mg PO q8h (postpartum preferred). Do NOT use ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or spironolactone during pregnancy.

6. **Anticoagulation if LVEF <30%.** Unfractionated heparin IV (antepartum or immediate peripartum) or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h (postpartum) — LV thrombus and systemic embolism risk is high with severely reduced EF. Warfarin postpartum (INR 2–3).

7. **Bromocriptine 2.5 mg PO BID x 2 weeks, then 2.5 mg PO daily x 6 weeks.** Inhibits prolactin cleavage to 16-kDa cardiotoxic fragment. Suppress lactation if patient elects to use bromocriptine (not compatible with breastfeeding). Ensure adequate contraception — anticoagulate while on bromocriptine (prolactin inhibition carries thrombotic risk).

8. **Admit all patients with new PPCM.** Even patients who appear hemodynamically stable require inpatient monitoring — LVEF can deteriorate rapidly.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Pulmonary embolism** | Pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, acute-onset dyspnea without volume overload signs; echo shows RV dilation not LV dysfunction; BNP mildly elevated; CT-PA confirms |
| **Preeclampsia with pulmonary edema** | Hypertension, proteinuria, edema; pulmonary edema from increased afterload / capillary leak, not primary cardiomyopathy; LVEF may be preserved |
| **Myocarditis** | Clinically indistinguishable from PPCM; may require cardiac MRI or biopsy to differentiate; managed identically in acute setting |
| **Normal pregnancy symptoms** | Dyspnea on exertion and edema are common in pregnancy — PPCM is distinguished by orthopnea, PND, new S3, rales, elevated BNP, and depressed LVEF on echo |
| **Pneumonia** | Fever, productive cough, lobar infiltrate on CXR; no cardiomegaly; BNP normal or mildly elevated |
| **Amniotic fluid embolism** | Sudden cardiovascular collapse during/immediately after delivery; DIC; not a subacute presentation |
| **Valvular disease exacerbated by pregnancy** | Prior murmur; valve abnormality on echo; not new cardiomyopathy |
| **Dilated cardiomyopathy (preexisting undiagnosed)** | PPCM requires exclusion of pre-existing cardiac disease; prior echo results, echo findings of pre-existent fibrosis, history of prior cardiac symptoms |

## Workup

**Emergency Department / Initial Evaluation:**
- 12-lead ECG: sinus tachycardia, LVH, nonspecific ST-T changes, atrial fibrillation; VT if severely dilated
- BNP or NT-proBNP: elevated in all heart failure; BNP >400 pg/mL indicates moderate–severe decompensation
- Portable CXR: cardiomegaly (CTR >0.5), bilateral pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, Kerley B lines
- Troponin I or T: elevated in myocardial injury; may be elevated in PPCM
- CBC, BMP, LFTs, TSH: assess for anemia, renal function, hepatic congestion (elevated transaminases from venous congestion), thyroid disease
- Coagulation panel if anticoagulation planned
- Urine pregnancy test if postpartum status uncertain

**Echocardiography (definitive):**
- Confirms LVEF <45%, LV dilation (LVEDD typically >55 mm)
- Identifies LV thrombus: TEE if TTE inconclusive; thrombus incidence up to 17% when EF <30%
- Right heart assessment: RVSP, TR gradient (pulmonary hypertension in advanced disease)
- Pericardial effusion: small effusions common; large effusion prompts evaluation for alternative etiology

**Cardiac MRI:**
- Not routinely indicated in acute setting; useful for differentiating PPCM from myocarditis (gadolinium late enhancement) when diagnosis uncertain
- Gadolinium: avoid in antepartum; acceptable postpartum

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous telemetry: arrhythmia monitoring for AF, VT
- Daily weights and fluid balance
- Serial BNP or NT-proBNP to assess treatment response

## Treatment

**Acute Decompensated Heart Failure:**

**Diuresis:**
- Furosemide 20–40 mg IV (first dose); repeat 40–80 mg IV q1–2h if urine output inadequate
- Target: urine output 1–2 mL/kg/hr, resolution of pulmonary edema on repeat CXR
- Monitor electrolytes: hypokalemia (K+ <3.5 mEq/L) and hypomagnesemia promote arrhythmia — replace aggressively

**Vasodilators (antepartum — ACEi/ARBs are CONTRAINDICATED in pregnancy):**
- Hydralazine 10–25 mg PO q6–8h; titrate to BP goal (systolic 110–140 mmHg)
- Isosorbide dinitrate 20–40 mg PO q8h (with hydralazine — hydralazine-nitrate combination is equivalent to ACEi/ARB)
- Acute dyspnea: nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL q5 min x3 PRN; IV nitroglycerin infusion 5–200 mcg/min for severe pulmonary edema

**Vasodilators (postpartum — preferred agents):**
- ACE inhibitor: enalapril 2.5 mg PO BID, titrate to 10–20 mg PO BID; OR lisinopril 5 mg PO daily, titrate to 40 mg daily
- ARB (if ACEi-intolerant): valsartan 40 mg PO BID, titrate to 160 mg PO BID
- Do NOT use during breastfeeding if on ACEi/ARB — discuss with lactation

**Beta-Blockers:**
- Carvedilol 3.125 mg PO BID, titrate by doubling q2 weeks to target 25 mg PO BID; preferred (nonselective, antioxidant properties)
- Metoprolol succinate 12.5–25 mg PO daily, titrate to 200 mg daily (alternative)
- Do NOT initiate beta-blockers in acutely decompensated, volume-overloaded state — wait until euvolemic

**Aldosterone Antagonists (postpartum only — spironolactone teratogenic):**
- Spironolactone 25–50 mg PO daily after delivery; titrate to 50 mg PO daily
- Monitor potassium (hyperkalemia risk with ACEi/ARB combination)

**Anticoagulation (LVEF <30%):**
- Antepartum: unfractionated heparin infusion IV (PTT 60–80 sec) OR enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h
- Peripartum (within 24h of delivery): UFH preferred (reversible with protamine)
- Postpartum: warfarin with INR 2–3 OR enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC q12h (bridge to warfarin); continue until LVEF recovers to >35%
- Novel anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, apixaban): avoid in pregnancy; acceptable postpartum if not breastfeeding

**Bromocriptine:**
- 2.5 mg PO BID x 2 weeks, then 2.5 mg PO daily x 6 weeks
- Suppress lactation (incompatible with breastfeeding)
- Anticoagulate with enoxaparin during bromocriptine therapy (thrombotic risk from prolactin inhibition)
- LVEF recovery at 6 months improved vs. standard therapy alone (HAART trial, Haghikia 2019)

**Cardiogenic Shock:**
- IV vasopressors: norepinephrine 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min IV (first-line); dobutamine 5–15 mcg/kg/min IV for low cardiac output state (combined with norepinephrine to counter hypotension)
- Mechanical circulatory support at capable centers: Impella, IABP, ECMO
- Urgent cardiac transplant evaluation for refractory cardiogenic shock

**Device Therapy (inpatient decision):**
- ICD implantation deferred until 6-month follow-up — do NOT implant ICD acutely in newly diagnosed PPCM (many recover LVEF)
- Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (LifeVest) may bridge to ICD decision in LVEF <35% with arrhythmia risk

## Disposition

**All new PPCM diagnoses require inpatient admission.**

**ICU/CCU Admission:**
- SpO2 <90% on room air
- HR >120 bpm despite initial diuresis
- Systolic BP <90 mmHg
- Cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressors
- New ventricular arrhythmia (VT/VF)
- LVEF <20%
- LV thrombus with hemodynamic instability

**Cardiology Floor/Step-Down:**
- Newly diagnosed PPCM with LVEF 20–40%, hemodynamically stable, SpO2 >92% on supplemental oxygen
- Requires telemetry, daily echo or serial reassessment, diuresis monitoring, initiation of GDMT

**Outpatient Follow-Up (after inpatient stabilization only):**
- LVEF >40% with mild symptoms, stable on oral therapy
- Close follow-up within 1–2 weeks with repeat echo at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
- No patient with new PPCM is safe for direct-to-outpatient management from the ED

**Subsequent Pregnancy Counseling:**
- Recurrence rate: 30–50% in subsequent pregnancies
- LVEF <25% at time of next conception carries >10% mortality risk with subsequent pregnancy
- Advise against subsequent pregnancy if LVEF has not recovered to ≥50%

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing dyspnea and edema to "normal pregnancy."** Dyspnea on exertion is common in normal pregnancy; orthopnea, PND, and new S3 gallop are not. Any peripartum woman with orthopnea, inability to lie flat, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or new S3 gallop requires immediate BNP and echo. The physical examination must include auscultation for S3, assessment of JVP, and lung exam for rales — do not dismiss the heart examination in a pregnant patient.

2. **Using ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or spironolactone during pregnancy.** ACEi and ARBs are FDA Category D in the second and third trimester — they cause fetal renal tubular dysplasia, oligohydramnios, calvarial hypoplasia, and neonatal renal failure. Spironolactone causes anti-androgenic effects in male fetuses. The vasodilator regimen in pregnancy is hydralazine + isosorbide dinitrate, not enalapril or valsartan. Confirm current pregnancy status before prescribing any PPCM medications.

3. **Initiating beta-blockers in the acutely volume-overloaded patient.** Beta-blockers are a cornerstone of PPCM management but are contraindicated in acute decompensated heart failure with volume overload. Starting carvedilol or metoprolol in a congested patient precipitates hemodynamic deterioration. Diurese to euvolemia first, then initiate beta-blockade at low dose on inpatient admission or at discharge.

4. **Discharging a newly diagnosed PPCM patient without echo-confirmed EF.** PPCM cannot be managed outpatient from the ED in the initial presentation. LVEF determines anticoagulation need (EF <30%), arrhythmia risk, and prognostic counseling. A patient who "looks well" with an LVEF of 15% has a 25% risk of end-stage cardiomyopathy and immediate thromboembolic risk from LV thrombus. All new PPCM requires admission.

5. **Missing LV thrombus by not performing echocardiography.** LV thrombus is present in up to 17% of PPCM patients with EF <30%. Systemic embolism (stroke, limb ischemia, mesenteric ischemia) is the presenting event in some patients. Any PPCM patient with LVEF <30% who has not had a recent echocardiogram with specific LV thrombus evaluation is not adequately worked up. Do not anticoagulate without imaging — confirm the thrombus and quantify LVEF to guide duration.

6. **Failure to involve cardiology before bromocriptine use.** Bromocriptine suppresses lactation and requires concurrent anticoagulation (thrombotic risk from prolactin inhibition). Using bromocriptine without establishing anticoagulation first, or without patient counseling on lactation cessation, creates additional harm. The HAART trial evidence supports benefit; the implementation requires coordination between cardiology and OB to ensure safety.
