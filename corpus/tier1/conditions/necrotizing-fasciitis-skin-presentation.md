# Necrotizing Fasciitis — Skin Presentation

## Recognition

**Hard signs (any one is sufficient for operative exploration):**
- Crepitus on palpation (subcutaneous gas)
- Skin necrosis or dusky discoloration beyond erythema
- Bullae (hemorrhagic or serous)
- Gas on imaging (CT or X-ray)
- Dishwater-gray wound drainage
- Skin anesthesia within area of erythema (nerve destruction)
- Rapid progression of erythema despite IV antibiotics

**Soft signs (high suspicion when multiple present):**
- Pain out of proportion to skin findings (hallmark — most sensitive early sign)
- Wooden-hard induration of subcutaneous tissue
- Edema beyond area of erythema
- Systemic toxicity: high fever, tachycardia, hypotension
- Failure to improve with 24-48h of appropriate cellulitis antibiotics

**Classification:**
- **Type I (polymicrobial):** Mixed aerobic/anaerobic flora; occurs in diabetics, post-surgical, perineal (Fournier gangrene)
- **Type II (monomicrobial):** Group A Streptococcus (most common), Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio vulnificus; occurs in otherwise healthy patients
- **Type III:** Clostridial gas gangrene (Clostridium perfringens); rapid gas formation, bronze skin

**LRINEC Score (Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis):**
- CRP >= 150 mg/L (+4)
- WBC 15-25k (+1), > 25k (+2)
- Hemoglobin < 13.5 (+1), < 11 (+2)
- Sodium < 135 (+2)
- Creatinine > 1.6 (+2)
- Glucose > 180 (+1)
- Score >= 6: High suspicion; Score >= 8: Strongly predictive
- NOTE: Low LRINEC does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis — clinical judgment supersedes scoring

## Critical Actions

1. **Emergent surgical consultation** — definitive diagnosis is made in the OR; do NOT delay for imaging if clinical suspicion is high
2. **Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics within 1 hour:**
   - Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose PLUS
   - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h PLUS
   - Clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h (toxin inhibition)
3. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation** — sepsis protocol; crystalloid 30 mL/kg in first 3 hours
4. **Operative debridement within 12 hours** of suspected diagnosis — earlier is better
5. **Mark erythema borders** with skin marker and timestamp to track progression
6. **Prepare for multiple debridements** — return to OR in 24-48h for re-exploration

## Differential Diagnosis

- Cellulitis — no crepitus, no pain out of proportion, responds to antibiotics
- Deep venous thrombosis — unilateral leg swelling, no skin necrosis
- Gas gangrene (Clostridial myonecrosis) — rapid gas formation, bronze discoloration, severe systemic toxicity (overlaps with Type III NF)
- Pyomyositis — deep muscle abscess, less skin involvement
- Abscess — fluctuant, localized, responds to I&D
- Allergic contact dermatitis — pruritic, vesicular, follows exposure pattern
- Calciphylaxis — chronic, reticular purpura, calcified vessels, dialysis patients
- Warfarin skin necrosis — temporal relation to warfarin initiation

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — surgery is both diagnostic and therapeutic; do NOT delay for labs or imaging
- **CT with contrast** (if diagnosis uncertain and patient stable) — fascial thickening, enhancement, gas tracking along fascial planes, fat stranding
- **MRI** — most sensitive for fascial involvement but time-consuming; useful if diagnosis unclear and patient stable
- **Plain X-ray** — subcutaneous gas (low sensitivity but specific if present)
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis (often > 15,000, may be > 25,000); bandemia
- **BMP:** Hyponatremia, elevated creatinine
- **CRP/ESR:** Markedly elevated
- **Lactate** — elevated in sepsis/tissue necrosis
- **Procalcitonin** — elevated in bacterial infection
- **Blood cultures** x 2 sets
- **Wound cultures** — deep tissue (not superficial swab); obtained at debridement
- **Creatine kinase** — elevated if myonecrosis
- **Coagulation studies** — DIC screening in septic patients

## Treatment

### Antibiotics
**Empiric triple therapy:**
- **Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h** (MRSA coverage)
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h** (broad gram-negative and anaerobic coverage)
- **Clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h** (ribosomal toxin synthesis inhibition — critical for GAS and Staph)

**Alternatives:**
- Meropenem 1 g IV q8h + vancomycin + clindamycin (if piperacillin-tazobactam unavailable)
- Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h + vancomycin (if allergic to pipercillin)

**For Vibrio vulnificus (saltwater/raw oyster exposure):**
- Doxycycline 100 mg IV q12h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h

**For Clostridial gas gangrene:**
- Penicillin G 4 million units IV q4h + clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h
- Hyperbaric oxygen (controversial; do NOT delay surgery for HBO)

**Duration:** Continue antibiotics 48-72h after last debridement with clinical improvement; typical total course 2-4 weeks

### Surgical Debridement
- **Mandatory** — this is the definitive treatment
- Extensive incisions beyond apparent involvement
- Debride all necrotic fascia and muscle until healthy, bleeding tissue encountered
- Leave wound open — do NOT close primarily
- **Return to OR in 24-48h** for re-exploration (most patients require 2-5 debridements)
- Operative findings: "dishwater" purulent fluid, necrotic gray fascia that separates from underlying muscle with blunt finger dissection

### Supportive Care
- IV fluid resuscitation per sepsis guidelines
- Vasopressors for septic shock
- Transfusion for hemorrhagic anemia from debridement
- Nutritional support (high protein, high calorie)
- Pain management (often requires opioids, consider ketamine infusion)
- DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily when not actively bleeding)
- IVIG 1-2 g/kg IV — for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (neutralizes superantigens)

### Wound Management (Post-Debridement)
- Negative pressure wound therapy (wound VAC) after initial debridements
- Eventual delayed closure, skin grafting, or flap coverage
- Plastic surgery consultation for reconstruction planning

## Disposition

- **All suspected necrotizing fasciitis:** ICU admission, emergent surgical debridement
- **Transfer immediately** if facility lacks surgical capability for aggressive debridement
- **Multi-disciplinary team:** Surgery, infectious disease, critical care, plastic surgery
- **Prolonged hospitalization:** Average 4-6 weeks; multiple surgeries, rehabilitation
- **Mortality:** 20-40% overall; up to 70% with delayed surgery or septic shock
- **Isolation:** Contact precautions; droplet if GAS toxic shock syndrome
- **Reportable:** Invasive Group A streptococcal disease is reportable in most US jurisdictions

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating as simple cellulitis.** Pain out of proportion to skin findings, systemic toxicity, and failure to improve on antibiotics are red flags. If any hard sign is present, proceed directly to operative exploration.

2. **Relying on a low LRINEC score to rule out necrotizing fasciitis.** The LRINEC score has limited sensitivity (~60-80%). Clinical suspicion must override scoring. When in doubt, take the patient to the OR.

3. **Delaying surgery for imaging.** CT and MRI can support the diagnosis but are neither 100% sensitive nor specific. If clinical suspicion is high, operative exploration is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Every hour of surgical delay increases mortality.

4. **Performing a single debridement and declaring the patient treated.** Necrotizing fasciitis requires serial debridements. The infection often extends beyond the initial operative field. Return to OR in 24-48h is standard.

5. **Omitting clindamycin.** Clindamycin inhibits toxin production at the ribosomal level. In GAS and Staphylococcal infections, toxin-mediated tissue destruction continues even after bactericidal antibiotics kill the organism. Clindamycin addresses this mechanism.

6. **Missing Fournier gangrene.** Perineal necrotizing fasciitis (Fournier gangrene) in diabetics or immunocompromised patients may present with subtle perineal pain and scrotal swelling. Digital rectal exam and perineal inspection are essential in patients with perineal/genital complaints and sepsis.
