# Adrenal Crisis

## Recognition

**Definition:** Life-threatening cortisol deficiency presenting with hemodynamic instability (hypotension or shock) that improves rapidly with parenteral glucocorticoid administration.

**Classic Presentation:**
- Refractory hypotension unresponsive to fluids and vasopressors
- Severe weakness, fatigue, obtundation
- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain (can mimic acute abdomen)
- Fever (cortisol deficiency impairs thermoregulation)

**Key Lab Findings:**
- Hyponatremia (cortisol is permissive for free water excretion)
- Hyperkalemia (in primary adrenal insufficiency — aldosterone deficiency)
- Hypoglycemia (cortisol is a counter-regulatory hormone)
- Hypercalcemia (rare, but described)
- Eosinophilia on CBC differential (cortisol suppresses eosinophils)

**Physical Exam:**
- Hyperpigmentation (chronic primary AI — ACTH-driven melanocyte stimulation) — skin creases, buccal mucosa, scars, areolae
- Vitiligo (autoimmune polyglandular syndrome)
- Orthostatic hypotension progressing to frank shock
- Decreased axillary/pubic hair in women (adrenal androgen deficiency)

**Triggers:**
- Physiologic stress (infection, surgery, trauma) in patients with known or undiagnosed adrenal insufficiency
- Abrupt discontinuation of chronic glucocorticoid therapy (most common cause)
- Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen — meningococcemia, anticoagulant-associated)
- Pituitary apoplexy (secondary AI)
- Checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (immune-related hypophysitis)

## Critical Actions

1. **Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus** — give immediately if adrenal crisis suspected. Do NOT wait for lab confirmation. This is both diagnostic and therapeutic.
2. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation** — NS 1-2 L IV bolus (20 mL/kg pediatric). These patients are profoundly volume-depleted. Continue 1 L/hr until hemodynamically stable.
3. **D50W 25-50 g IV** — if glucose < 60 mg/dL. Start D10W infusion for persistent hypoglycemia.
4. **Correct hyperkalemia** — if K > 6.0 mEq/L or ECG changes: calcium gluconate 1 g IV, insulin 10 units IV + D50W 25 g, sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq IV.
5. **Identify precipitant** — obtain blood cultures, UA, CXR, lactate. Infection is the most common trigger.
6. **Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6-8h** — continued stress-dose steroids after initial bolus. Taper over 1-3 days as precipitant resolves.
7. **Draw cortisol and ACTH BEFORE steroid administration if possible** — but NEVER delay treatment for labs. A single pre-treatment cortisol tube is sufficient.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Septic shock | Fever, infectious source; adrenal crisis can co-occur with sepsis (critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency). Both may improve with hydrocortisone. |
| Myxedema coma | Hypothermia, bradycardia, delayed relaxation of reflexes, low TSH/free T4; can co-occur with adrenal crisis in polyglandular syndrome |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | Hyperglycemia (not hypoglycemia), anion gap, Kussmaul breathing |
| Acute abdomen (surgical) | Abdominal pain and vomiting overlap; adrenal crisis can mimic appendicitis or bowel obstruction. CT often normal. |
| Anaphylaxis | Urticaria, allergen exposure, responds to epinephrine |
| Opioid overdose | Pinpoint pupils, respiratory depression, responds to naloxone |
| Cardiogenic shock | Elevated JVP, pulmonary edema, echo with low EF |
| Hemorrhagic shock | Obvious or occult bleeding source, tachycardia, dropping hemoglobin |

## Workup

**Draw BEFORE steroids if feasible (do not delay treatment):**
- Random serum cortisol — < 3 mcg/dL is diagnostic of adrenal insufficiency during physiologic stress. 3-15 mcg/dL is indeterminate. > 15 mcg/dL makes AI unlikely.
- ACTH level — elevated in primary AI (> 2x ULN), low/normal in secondary AI

**Standard Labs:**
- BMP — hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (primary AI), hypoglycemia
- CBC — eosinophilia, lymphocytosis; anemia of chronic disease
- Calcium — occasional hypercalcemia
- Lactate — elevated in shock
- TSH and free T4 — screen for concurrent hypothyroidism (polyglandular autoimmune syndrome)
- Blood cultures — if fever or suspected infection trigger

**Imaging:**
- CT adrenals — bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (hyperattenuating adrenals), adrenal infiltration/metastases
- CT head/MRI pituitary — if secondary AI suspected (pituitary apoplexy: headache, visual field deficits, hypopituitarism)
- CXR — infection source

**ECG:** Hyperkalemia changes (peaked T waves, prolonged PR, widened QRS).

## Treatment

**Stress-Dose Glucocorticoids:**
- Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, then 50 mg IV q6-8h (200 mg/day) for first 24 hours
- Alternative: dexamethasone 4 mg IV if ACTH stimulation test planned (dexamethasone does not cross-react with cortisol assay)
- Taper: reduce to hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q8h on day 2, then transition to oral maintenance over 2-5 days as precipitant resolves

**Volume Resuscitation:**
- NS 1-2 L IV bolus, repeat as needed. Total deficit often 3-5 L.
- Avoid hypotonic fluids (worsens hyponatremia)
- Dextrose-containing fluids (D5NS) once volume repleted if hypoglycemia persists

**Mineralocorticoid:**
- Not needed during acute crisis — hydrocortisone at stress doses (>= 50 mg/day) has adequate mineralocorticoid activity
- Fludrocortisone 0.1 mg PO daily — add when hydrocortisone dose tapers below 50 mg/day in primary AI

**Treat Precipitant:**
- Empiric antibiotics if infection suspected (after cultures drawn)
- Surgical intervention if bilateral adrenal hemorrhage from trauma

**Chronic Steroid Taper Patients:**
- Resume prior steroid dose and taper more gradually
- Stress dosing for illness/surgery per sick-day rules

## Disposition

**ICU Admission:**
- All patients with adrenal crisis and hemodynamic instability
- Vasopressor requirement
- Altered mental status
- Significant electrolyte derangements (K > 6.0, Na < 125)

**Monitored Bed:**
- Known adrenal insufficiency presenting with early crisis (nausea, weakness, mild hypotension) that responds rapidly to hydrocortisone and fluids

**Discharge (rare from ED):**
- Known AI patient with mild intercurrent illness who presents early
- Administer hydrocortisone 100 mg IV/IM in ED, observe for clinical improvement
- Double oral maintenance dose for 2-3 days (sick-day rules)
- Clear return precautions: vomiting, inability to take oral meds, worsening symptoms

**Endocrinology Consultation:**
- All new diagnoses of adrenal insufficiency
- All adrenal crisis presentations

## Pitfalls

1. **Not thinking of adrenal crisis in refractory shock.** Patients who remain hypotensive despite adequate fluids and vasopressors should receive empiric hydrocortisone 100 mg IV. The response is often dramatic and diagnostic.

2. **Waiting for cortisol results before giving hydrocortisone.** Cortisol assay results take hours. Adrenal crisis kills in minutes to hours. Treat empirically, confirm later.

3. **Using dexamethasone at doses too low for crisis.** If using dexamethasone instead of hydrocortisone (e.g., to preserve ACTH stim test), the dose is 4 mg IV — not the 0.5-1 mg used for other indications.

4. **Forgetting that chronic steroid use is the most common cause of adrenal suppression.** Patients on prednisone >= 5 mg/day (or equivalent) for > 3 weeks have hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression. Any physiologic stress without stress-dose steroids can precipitate crisis.

5. **Missing the diagnosis because the patient lacks hyperpigmentation.** Hyperpigmentation occurs only in chronic primary AI (elevated ACTH). Secondary AI (pituitary/exogenous steroid) patients have pale skin. Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage presents acutely without pigmentary changes.

6. **Attributing abdominal pain to a surgical cause.** Adrenal crisis causes severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that mimic acute abdomen. Unnecessary laparotomy in undiagnosed adrenal crisis is reported — and dangerous without stress-dose steroids.

7. **Not checking glucose.** Hypoglycemia in adrenal crisis is common and contributes to altered mental status. Correct with D50W and maintain dextrose infusion.

8. **Inadequate fluid resuscitation.** These patients have profound cortisol-mediated vasodilation and volume depletion. A single 500 mL bolus is insufficient. Expect 3-5 L replacement in the first 24 hours.

9. **Stopping stress-dose steroids too quickly.** Taper over days, not hours. Rebound crisis occurs if steroids are dropped abruptly once the patient "looks better."
