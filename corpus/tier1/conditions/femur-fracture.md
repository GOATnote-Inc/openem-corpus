# Femur Fracture

## Recognition

**Mechanism:**
- **Shaft fractures:** High-energy trauma (MVC, motorcycle, fall from height) in young adults; low-energy falls in elderly with osteoporosis
- **Neck/intertrochanteric fractures:** Fall in elderly (> 90% are age > 65); high-energy in young patients
- **Pathologic fractures:** Metastatic disease, osteoporosis — minimal or no trauma

**Classification:**
- **Femoral neck (intracapsular):** Garden I-IV. Displaced fractures (Garden III-IV) at risk for AVN due to disruption of circumflex femoral artery blood supply.
- **Intertrochanteric (extracapsular):** Stable vs. unstable patterns. Lower AVN risk.
- **Subtrochanteric:** High biomechanical stress area; often comminuted. Significant blood loss.
- **Shaft (diaphyseal):** AO/OTA classification. Associated with 1-1.5 L blood loss per fracture.

**Presentation:**
- Severe pain in thigh or hip, inability to bear weight
- Shortened, externally rotated leg (displaced hip fracture)
- Thigh swelling, deformity (shaft fracture)
- Hemodynamic instability (shaft fractures can lose 1-1.5 L per fracture; bilateral = massive hemorrhage)
- Open fracture: bone protruding through skin, soft tissue wound

**Associated injuries (high-energy mechanism):**
- Ipsilateral knee ligament injury (10-15%)
- Femoral neck fracture with shaft fracture (2-6% — easily missed)
- Hip dislocation
- Pelvic fracture
- Vascular injury (femoral artery, popliteal with distal fractures)
- Fat embolism syndrome (12-48 hours post-injury)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Hemorrhage control + resuscitation | Immediate |
| X-ray hip through knee | < 30 minutes |
| Traction splint (shaft fractures) | < 15 minutes |
| Orthopedic consult | < 1 hour |
| OR (elderly hip fracture) | < 24-48 hours |

1. **ATLS primary survey** — femur fractures are markers of high-energy mechanism with frequent associated injuries
2. **Hemorrhage management:** Large-bore IV x 2, crystalloid then blood products. Each femur fracture loses 1-1.5 L (thigh compartment can hold up to 3 L). Bilateral = activate MTP.
3. **Traction splint** for midshaft femur fractures — reduces pain, bleeding, and fat embolism risk. Apply Hare/Sager traction splint or Thomas splint. **Contraindications:** ipsilateral pelvic fracture, knee injury, ankle/foot fracture on same side.
4. **Pain management:** Femoral nerve block (preferred) — bupivacaine 0.25% 20 mL or ropivacaine 0.5% 15 mL. Landmark or ultrasound-guided. IV fentanyl 25-50 mcg q30min PRN as bridge.
5. **Full-length femur X-ray (hip to knee)** — must include hip joint and knee joint to avoid missing concurrent femoral neck fracture
6. **CT pelvis** if hip fracture suspected but not visible on plain film (occult femoral neck fracture)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Hip dislocation (shortened, internally rotated [posterior] or externally rotated [anterior])
- Pelvic fracture (pelvic ring tenderness, instability)
- Femoral shaft stress fracture (insidious onset, military recruits, runners)
- Pathologic fracture (history of cancer, lytic lesion on X-ray)
- Greater trochanteric bursitis (point tenderness, no fracture on imaging)
- Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (adolescents — hip/knee pain, limited internal rotation)
- Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (children — AVN of femoral head)

## Workup

- **X-ray:** AP and lateral of entire femur (hip to knee). AP pelvis. Dedicated hip views if hip fracture suspected.
- **CT hip/pelvis:** Occult femoral neck fracture (not visible on plain film but suspected clinically)
- **MRI hip:** If CT negative and high suspicion (occult stress fracture, non-displaced Garden I)
- **CT angiography:** If vascular injury suspected (distal femur fracture near popliteal artery, absent pulses)
- **Labs:** CBC (serial for hemorrhage monitoring), BMP, type and crossmatch, coagulation studies, lactate
- **Chest X-ray:** Baseline and for associated thoracic injury in high-energy mechanism
- **Screening for fat embolism:** Serial SpO2, mental status, petechial rash at 12-72 hours post-injury

## Treatment

**Pre-operative management:**
- Traction splint for shaft fractures (reduces fracture, controls bleeding)
- Femoral nerve block for analgesia (see dosing above)
- DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily or mechanical compression (initiate pre-operatively per institutional protocol)
- NPO for surgical planning

**Surgical fixation — timing matters:**
- **Elderly hip fractures:** Surgery within 24-48 hours reduces mortality, delirium, pneumonia, pressure ulcers (AAOS guideline). Every 24-hour delay increases 30-day mortality by 5%.
- **Young displaced femoral neck fractures:** Emergent reduction and fixation within 6-12 hours to minimize AVN risk
- **Shaft fractures in polytrauma:** "Damage control orthopedics" — temporary external fixation acutely, definitive intramedullary nailing at 24-72 hours when physiologically stable
- **Isolated shaft fractures:** Intramedullary nailing within 24 hours

**Surgical options:**
- **Femoral neck (young):** Closed reduction + percutaneous cannulated screws (Garden I-II); open reduction + internal fixation or hip arthroplasty (Garden III-IV)
- **Femoral neck (elderly displaced):** Hemiarthroplasty or total hip arthroplasty
- **Intertrochanteric:** Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or cephalomedullary nail (trochanteric fixation nail)
- **Subtrochanteric:** Cephalomedullary nail (long)
- **Shaft:** Antegrade or retrograde intramedullary nail

**Anticoagulation for DVT prophylaxis:**
- Enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily starting 12-24 hours post-operatively
- Continue x 28-35 days for hip fractures (extended prophylaxis reduces DVT by 50%)
- Alternative: rivaroxaban 10 mg PO daily, apixaban 2.5 mg PO BID

**Fat embolism syndrome prophylaxis/treatment:**
- Early fixation (< 24 hours) reduces FES incidence
- Supportive care if FES develops: supplemental O2, mechanical ventilation if needed
- No proven pharmacologic prevention (methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg IV q8h x 6 doses studied but not standard)

## Disposition

- **Admit:** All femur fractures require admission
- **ICU:** Hemorrhagic shock, bilateral fractures, polytrauma, open fractures, fat embolism syndrome
- **Orthopedic surgery consult:** All cases — timing of fixation is critical
- **Geriatric co-management:** Elderly hip fractures benefit from orthogeriatric care model (reduces mortality)
- **Transfer:** Facility with orthopedic surgery capability if not available
- **VTE prophylaxis:** Extended 28-35 days post-operatively

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing concurrent ipsilateral femoral neck fracture with shaft fracture.** Occurs in 2-6% of shaft fractures. Always obtain full-length imaging including the hip joint. If not identified preoperatively, it is missed at surgery and discovered postoperatively.

2. **Underestimating blood loss.** A single femur shaft fracture can lose 1-1.5 L into the thigh compartment. Bilateral fractures can cause Class III-IV hemorrhagic shock. Start transfusion early.

3. **Applying traction splint when contraindicated.** Traction splints are contraindicated with ipsilateral pelvic fracture, knee ligament injury, or ankle/foot fracture. These are common concurrent injuries in high-energy mechanism.

4. **Delaying surgical fixation of elderly hip fractures beyond 48 hours.** Each day of delay increases 30-day mortality, delirium, pneumonia, and pressure ulcer rates. Medical optimization should not delay surgery beyond 48 hours unless the patient has a reversible, life-threatening condition.

5. **Not screening for fat embolism syndrome in the 12-72 hour window.** Classic triad: hypoxemia, altered mental status, petechial rash. Onset is delayed 12-72 hours. Serial SpO2 monitoring and neurologic assessment are essential in all femur fracture patients.

6. **Forgetting extended VTE prophylaxis.** Hip fractures have the highest VTE risk of any orthopedic injury. Extended prophylaxis (28-35 days) reduces DVT by 50%. In-hospital prophylaxis alone is inadequate.
