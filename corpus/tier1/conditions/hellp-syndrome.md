# HELLP Syndrome

## Recognition

**Definition:** HELLP syndrome is a severe variant of preeclampsia defined by the triad of Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, and Low Platelets. It represents end-organ damage and carries risk of hepatic rupture, cerebral hemorrhage, DIC, placental abruption, and maternal death. Delivery is the only definitive treatment.

**Diagnostic Criteria (Tennessee Classification — Sibai):**

| Component | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Hemolysis** | Abnormal peripheral smear (schistocytes, burr cells) OR LDH >600 IU/L OR indirect bilirubin >1.2 mg/dL |
| **Elevated Liver Enzymes** | AST >70 IU/L OR ALT >70 IU/L |
| **Low Platelets** | Platelet count <100,000/mm³ |

**Partial HELLP** (1–2 components) carries elevated risk and should be managed as HELLP until proven otherwise.

**Key Epidemiological Features:**
- Incidence: 0.5–0.9% of all pregnancies; 10–20% of severe preeclampsia cases
- Onset: 70% antepartum (27–37 weeks gestation); 30% postpartum (usually within 48 hours of delivery)
- **15% of HELLP cases occur WITHOUT hypertension or proteinuria** — do not use absence of hypertension to exclude HELLP
- Recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies: 3–27%

**Presenting Signs and Symptoms:**

| Feature | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **RUQ or epigastric pain** | 65–90% | Caused by hepatic capsule distension; may radiate to shoulder |
| **Nausea and vomiting** | 50% | Often attributed to gastrointestinal etiology; delays diagnosis |
| **Malaise, fatigue** | 90% | Nonspecific; frequently present days before diagnosis |
| **Headache** | 30–60% | May indicate cerebral edema or impending hemorrhage |
| **Hypertension** | 85% | Absent in 15% — do NOT use normotension to exclude HELLP |
| **Edema** | 55–67% | Nonspecific; may be absent |
| **Visual disturbances** | 10–20% | Scotoma, blurring — sign of CNS involvement |
| **Jaundice** | Uncommon | Late finding; indicates severe hemolysis |

## Critical Actions

1. **Urgent OB consultation and admission.** HELLP is a delivery-driven emergency. Notify OB/MFM immediately — the decision on timing and route of delivery must be made emergently.

2. **Establish IV access (two large-bore IVs, 16-gauge or larger).** Draw: CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, LFTs (AST, ALT, LDH, total and indirect bilirubin), PT/INR/PTT, fibrinogen, uric acid, urinalysis with protein, peripheral blood smear, type and screen.

3. **Magnesium sulfate 4–6 g IV over 15–20 minutes, then 1–2 g/hr IV infusion** for seizure prophylaxis. Maintain for 24 hours postpartum minimum. Monitor for magnesium toxicity: check reflexes hourly, respiratory rate, urine output >25 mL/hr. Therapeutic level 4–7 mEq/L. Calcium gluconate 1 g IV is the antidote for toxicity.

4. **Antihypertensive therapy for severe-range BP.** Treat BP >160/110 mmHg within 30–60 minutes (ACOG threshold for acute therapy). Labetalol 20 mg IV (may repeat 40 mg then 80 mg q10 min, max 300 mg); OR hydralazine 5–10 mg IV q20 min (max 20 mg); OR nifedipine immediate-release 10 mg PO q20 min (max 30 mg). Do NOT use ACE inhibitors or ARBs (teratogenic).

5. **Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12h.** Use for stabilization, to enhance fetal lung maturity if <34 weeks, and potentially to allow transfer to higher level of care. Evidence for maternal platelet improvement is mixed; do not delay delivery based on steroid response alone.

6. **Type and crossmatch.** Anticipate massive transfusion. Crossmatch minimum 4 units pRBC. Platelet threshold for transfusion: <50,000 in active bleeding, <20,000 prophylactically, <50,000 before regional anesthesia.

7. **Deliver.** Delivery is the only definitive treatment for HELLP. Gestational age, fetal status, and maternal stability determine timing and route. Maternal instability — regardless of gestational age — mandates delivery. Expectant management beyond 34 weeks is not indicated. Expectant management before 34 weeks only at tertiary center with MFM oversight.

8. **Monitor for hepatic hematoma / rupture.** Sudden worsening of RUQ pain, hemodynamic deterioration, or drop in hemoglobin without obvious bleeding source — activate surgical and interventional radiology teams immediately.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Acute fatty liver of pregnancy** | Hypoglycemia, elevated creatinine, coagulopathy with normal-mild platelets, microvesicular fat on liver biopsy; overlaps with HELLP |
| **TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura)** | ADAMTS13 deficiency (<10%), fever, neurologic symptoms, renal failure; not pregnancy-specific; responds to plasma exchange |
| **HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome)** | Predominant renal failure, diarrheal prodrome (Shiga toxin); thrombocytopenia + hemolysis + AKI |
| **ITP (immune thrombocytopenic purpura)** | Isolated thrombocytopenia, no hemolysis, no liver enzyme elevation, no hypertension |
| **Lupus flare** | History of SLE, anti-dsDNA titers, complement levels (C3/C4); may be indistinguishable — both may coexist |
| **Antiphospholipid syndrome** | Antiphospholipid antibodies; history of thrombosis or pregnancy loss; may trigger HELLP-like picture |
| **Cholecystitis / cholelithiasis** | RUQ pain, fever, Murphy's sign, normal platelets, normal CBC without hemolysis; ultrasound shows gallstones |
| **Viral hepatitis** | Aminotransferases markedly elevated (>500–1000 IU/L), no thrombocytopenia, serologies positive |

## Workup

**Initial labs (draw with IV placement — do not delay for results):**
- CBC with differential (platelets, hemoglobin trend)
- Peripheral blood smear (schistocytes confirm hemolysis)
- LDH, total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin
- AST, ALT, GGT, alkaline phosphatase
- PT, INR, PTT, fibrinogen (DIC screen)
- Creatinine, BUN, uric acid
- Urinalysis with spot protein:creatinine ratio
- Type and screen (crossmatch if platelets <50,000 or clinical hemorrhage)

**Imaging:**
- Liver ultrasound: evaluate for subcapsular hematoma, free fluid. Order immediately in any patient with worsening RUQ pain or hemodynamic instability.
- CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast (if stable): superior sensitivity for hepatic hematoma vs. ultrasound; obtain if ultrasound equivocal and clinical suspicion high
- Fetal monitoring: continuous EFM for fetal well-being assessment

**Serial Labs:**
- Repeat CBC, LFTs, LDH, creatinine, coagulation panel q6h until stable or improving postpartum
- Platelet nadir typically occurs 24–48 hours postpartum

## Treatment

**Seizure Prophylaxis:**
- Magnesium sulfate 4–6 g IV loading dose over 15–20 min, then 1–2 g/hr IV continuous infusion
- Continue 24–48 hours postpartum
- Toxic levels: loss of patellar reflex at 7–10 mEq/L, respiratory paralysis at >10 mEq/L, cardiac arrest at >15 mEq/L
- Antidote: calcium gluconate 1 g IV (10 mL of 10% solution) over 3 minutes

**Antihypertensive Therapy (for BP >160/110 mmHg):**
- Labetalol 20 mg IV; if BP not controlled in 10 min, give 40 mg IV; if still uncontrolled, 80 mg IV; max cumulative dose 300 mg
- Hydralazine 5 mg IV; repeat 5–10 mg IV q20 min; max 20 mg IV
- Nifedipine immediate-release 10 mg PO; repeat 10–20 mg PO q20 min if needed; max 30 mg in first hour
- Target BP: systolic 140–155 mmHg, diastolic 90–105 mmHg (do not overcorrect — risks placental hypoperfusion)

**Corticosteroids:**
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q12h for fetal lung maturity (<34 weeks) and maternal stabilization
- Betamethasone 12 mg IM q24h x2 doses (alternative for fetal lung maturity)
- Steroid use does not replace delivery and should not delay it in unstable patients

**Transfusion Thresholds:**
- pRBC: transfuse for hemoglobin <7 g/dL or symptomatic anemia; higher threshold (8–10 g/dL) if surgical delivery planned
- Platelets: transfuse for platelets <50,000 with active bleeding; <20,000 prophylactically; <50,000 before cesarean; platelets rise typically 48–72 h postpartum
- FFP: for INR >1.5 with active bleeding or surgical procedure
- Cryoprecipitate: for fibrinogen <200 mg/dL
- Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 min for active hemorrhage

**Hepatic Rupture (complication — requires immediate surgical response):**
- Suspected subcapsular hematoma: immediate MFM/surgery/IR consultation; CT to confirm if stable
- Confirmed rupture with hemodynamic instability: immediate laparotomy, manual compression, packing; IR embolization if hemodynamically stable; hysterectomy concurrent with delivery

**Delivery:**
- Vaginal delivery preferred if cervix is favorable and no obstetric contraindication
- Cesarean for standard obstetric indications (not for HELLP alone)
- No minimum gestational age — maternal instability mandates delivery at any gestation
- Regional anesthesia (epidural/spinal): safe if platelets ≥80,000; avoid with platelets <80,000 (increased epidural hematoma risk)

## Disposition

**All HELLP patients require admission. Level of care depends on severity.**

**ICU Admission Indications:**
- Platelets <50,000 with active bleeding or surgical hemorrhage
- Hepatic rupture or subcapsular hematoma
- DIC requiring massive transfusion
- Hypertensive crisis unresponsive to initial therapy
- Renal failure (creatinine >2.0 mg/dL or oliguria <0.5 mL/kg/hr)
- Pulmonary edema
- Altered mental status, seizure refractory to magnesium

**Step-Down / Labor and Delivery Unit:**
- Stable HELLP with platelets >80,000, controlled BP, no DIC, awaiting delivery

**Transfer:**
- Transfer to tertiary center if: before 34 weeks and considering expectant management, or facility lacks blood bank, MFM, or neonatal ICU
- Stabilize with magnesium, antihypertensives, and IV access before transport
- Do not transfer hemodynamically unstable patients

**Postpartum Monitoring:**
- Platelet nadir 24–48 hours postpartum — continue close monitoring; do not discharge early
- Magnesium infusion continued 24–48 hours postpartum
- Most patients with HELLP improve within 72–96 hours of delivery; failure to improve suggests TTP/HUS or alternative diagnosis

## Pitfalls

1. **Diagnosing cholecystitis or gastritis in a pregnant patient with RUQ pain and nausea without checking a CBC and LFTs.** RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting in a pregnant woman beyond 20 weeks gestation is HELLP syndrome until proven otherwise. Check platelets and liver enzymes before attributing symptoms to benign GI disease. Missing HELLP at this stage leads to hepatic rupture or cerebral hemorrhage.

2. **Using absence of hypertension or proteinuria to exclude HELLP.** Fifteen percent of HELLP cases present without hypertension and without proteinuria. The diagnosis rests on the laboratory triad — not blood pressure or urine protein. A normotensive patient with platelets of 60,000, AST of 200 IU/L, and schistocytes on smear has HELLP.

3. **Waiting for steroid response before delivering an unstable patient.** Dexamethasone may transiently improve platelet counts and liver enzyme trends. This is a stabilization adjunct, not a treatment. Any patient with HELLP who is hemodynamically unstable, has platelets falling below 50,000, has evidence of hepatic rupture, or has DIC must be delivered regardless of steroid effect or gestational age.

4. **Failing to monitor for postpartum deterioration.** Thirty percent of HELLP cases present or worsen postpartum, typically within 48 hours of delivery. Discharging a patient 12–24 hours postpartum because labs have not yet nadir'd leads to readmission with platelet counts of 20,000 and active bleeding. Platelet nadir is 24–48 hours postpartum. Observe minimum 48–72 hours.

5. **Misattributing HELLP laboratory findings to TTP without ruling out HELLP first.** TTP and HELLP share thrombocytopenia and hemolysis. TTP is far rarer. In a pregnant patient after 20 weeks, HELLP is the default diagnosis. TTP is distinguished by severe ADAMTS13 deficiency (<10%), marked renal failure disproportionate to platelet drop, fever, and neurological symptoms. Plasmapheresis for assumed TTP in a HELLP patient delays delivery — the only treatment that works for HELLP.

6. **Administering regional anesthesia without checking a recent platelet count.** Platelet count in HELLP can fall precipitously. A platelet count of 120,000 at 0800 may be 60,000 by noon. Check platelets within 1–2 hours of planned neuraxial anesthesia. Epidural hematoma from neuraxial anesthesia with a platelet count <80,000 carries risk of permanent spinal cord injury.
