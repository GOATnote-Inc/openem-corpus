# Tube Thoracostomy

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Traumatic pneumothorax (any size in patients requiring positive pressure ventilation or air transport)
- Tension pneumothorax (after initial needle decompression or finger thoracostomy)
- Hemothorax (traumatic or spontaneous)
- Massive hemothorax (> 1500 mL initial output or > 200 mL/hr for 4 hours — indication for thoracotomy)
- Empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion
- Large pleural effusion causing respiratory compromise
- Recurrent pneumothorax (definitive drainage before pleurodesis)
- Post-decompression: convert needle decompression or finger thoracostomy to tube thoracostomy

**Contraindications:**
- None absolute in life-threatening tension pneumothorax or massive hemothorax
- Relative: coagulopathy (correct if possible, but do not delay in emergency), pleural adhesions (prior surgery or pleurodesis — use blunt dissection carefully), diaphragmatic hernia (risk of abdominal organ injury)

**Tube Size Selection:**

| Indication | Size |
|-----------|------|
| Traumatic hemothorax | 28-36 Fr |
| Pneumothorax (adult) | 24-28 Fr |
| Empyema | 28-36 Fr (large for viscous fluid) |
| Simple effusion | 12-20 Fr (pigtail catheter acceptable) |
| Pediatric | 12-24 Fr (age-dependent) |

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Decision to chest tube | Immediate for tension or massive hemothorax |
| Skin to pleural space | < 5 minutes |
| Initial output documented | Immediately after insertion |
| CXR post-insertion | Within 30 minutes |

1. **Identify insertion site** — 4th-5th intercostal space, anterior to mid-axillary line (triangle of safety)
2. **Prep, drape, and anesthetize** the area
3. **Incision, blunt dissection, and pleural entry** with finger confirmation
4. **Insert tube** directed posteriorly and apically
5. **Connect to drainage system** (underwater seal or Pleur-evac)
6. **Confirm placement** with CXR
7. **Secure tube** with suture and dressing

## Differential Diagnosis

**Alternative Pleural Drainage Techniques:**

| Technique | When to Use |
|-----------|------------|
| Needle decompression | Temporizing for tension pneumothorax; convert to tube thoracostomy |
| Finger thoracostomy | Rapid decompression in trauma arrest; convert to tube thoracostomy |
| Pigtail catheter (Seldinger) | Small pneumothorax, simple effusion; NOT for hemothorax (too small for clots) |
| Thoracentesis | Diagnostic or therapeutic drainage of effusion; not for emergency pneumothorax |
| Thoracotomy | Massive hemothorax with ongoing hemorrhage; retained hemothorax; empyema requiring decortication |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- CXR (upright PA preferred; supine AP in trauma acceptable) — confirm side, estimate volume
- Ultrasound: absent lung sliding (pneumothorax), anechoic fluid (effusion/hemothorax), lung point
- CT chest: definitive imaging for loculated collections, tube positioning (when time permits)
- Coagulation studies (correct if INR > 2 or platelets < 20K, unless emergency)

**Equipment:**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Chest tube | Appropriate size (see above); thoracostomy tray |
| Scalpel | No. 10 blade |
| Kelly clamp | Large, curved |
| Scissors | Heavy Mayo |
| Finger (gloved) | For blunt dissection and pleural confirmation |
| Suture | 0-silk on large needle (horizontal mattress + securing stitch) |
| Drainage system | Pleur-evac or equivalent (underwater seal with suction) |
| Lidocaine | 1% lidocaine with epinephrine, 20-30 mL (liberal local anesthesia) |
| Chlorhexidine | Skin prep |
| Sterile drape | Fenestrated or towel drapes |
| Vaseline gauze | For occlusive dressing |

## Treatment

### Standard Open Technique (Blunt Dissection)

**Step 1: Position**
- Supine with ipsilateral arm abducted 90 degrees and hand behind head (exposes the axilla and widens intercostal spaces)
- Alternatively: lateral decubitus with affected side up (for elective drainage)

**Step 2: Identify Insertion Site**
- Triangle of safety: bordered by anterior border of latissimus dorsi, lateral border of pectoralis major, and a horizontal line at the level of the nipple (5th ICS)
- Mark the 4th or 5th intercostal space in the anterior-to-mid axillary line
- The nipple is at the 4th ICS in males; the inframammary fold approximates the 5th ICS in females

**Step 3: Prep, Drape, Anesthetize**
- Chlorhexidine scrub
- Sterile drape exposing the insertion site
- Lidocaine 1% with epinephrine: infiltrate skin, subcutaneous tissue, intercostal muscles, and periosteum of the rib above and below; aspirate to confirm when entering the pleural space (air or fluid confirms depth)
- Total: 20-30 mL — generous anesthesia prevents patient movement during insertion

**Step 4: Skin Incision**
- 3-4 cm transverse incision at the 5th intercostal space (one rib space below the target entry — this creates a subcutaneous tunnel)
- Cut through skin and subcutaneous fat

**Step 5: Blunt Dissection**
- Use Kelly clamp to dissect through intercostal muscles directly ABOVE the 6th rib (avoiding the neurovascular bundle running beneath the 5th rib)
- Direct the clamp over the superior border of the rib and push through the intercostal muscles and parietal pleura
- A "pop" or rush of air/fluid confirms pleural entry
- Spread the clamp to widen the tract

**Step 6: Finger Sweep**
- Insert a gloved finger through the tract into the pleural space
- Sweep 360 degrees to: (1) confirm intrapleural location, (2) feel for lung, adhesions, or diaphragm, (3) ensure the lung is not adherent at the entry site
- If the diaphragm is palpable, the incision is too low — close and move one space higher

**Step 7: Insert Tube**
- Clamp the tube tip with a Kelly clamp
- Guide the tube into the pleural space directed posteriorly and superiorly (apically)
- Advance until the last drainage hole is well within the pleural cavity (all side holes must be inside the chest)
- Typical depth: 10-15 cm past the chest wall
- Release clamp; connect to drainage system
- Fogging of the tube with respiration confirms intrapleural position

**Step 8: Secure**
- Horizontal mattress "U-stitch" suture around the tube for closure after removal
- Separately secure the tube to the skin with a silk tie
- Apply Vaseline gauze occlusive dressing and tape

**Step 9: Connect and Confirm**
- Connect to underwater seal drainage (Pleur-evac or equivalent) with -20 cmH2O suction
- Document initial output (volume, character — serous, bloody, purulent)
- CXR: confirm tube position (tip directed apically for pneumothorax, posteriorly/inferiorly for effusion), lung re-expansion, no residual collection

### Post-Procedure
- Monitor drainage output: volume, rate, character
- Massive hemothorax criteria (consult surgery): > 1500 mL initial output OR > 200 mL/hr for 4 consecutive hours
- Check for air leak: bubbling in water seal chamber with respiration or cough
- Daily CXR to assess lung expansion and tube position
- Pain management: intercostal nerve block, PCA, or scheduled IV analgesics

## Disposition

- **Traumatic pneumothorax/hemothorax:** trauma service admission; serial CXR
- **Massive hemothorax:** emergent thoracotomy consultation; OR for hemorrhage control
- **Spontaneous pneumothorax (primary, small):** observation with tube to water seal; removal when air leak resolved and CXR shows lung expansion (typically 24-72 hours)
- **Empyema:** admit; IV antibiotics; possible VATS or decortication if drainage inadequate
- **Tube removal:** when output < 100-200 mL/day and no air leak; remove during end-expiration or Valsalva; apply occlusive dressing; CXR post-removal

## Pitfalls

1. **Inserting the tube too low and entering the abdomen through the diaphragm.** The diaphragm rises to the 4th-5th intercostal space in expiration. Inserting at the 6th ICS or below risks diaphragmatic and intra-abdominal organ injury (liver on right, spleen on left). Always confirm position with finger sweep before tube insertion. If the diaphragm is palpable, the incision is too low.

2. **Using a trocar (sharp stylet) to insert the chest tube.** Trocar insertion is associated with significantly higher rates of intrathoracic organ injury (lung, diaphragm, heart) compared to blunt dissection. Blunt finger technique is the standard of care for emergency tube thoracostomy.

3. **Not directing the tube posteriorly for hemothorax.** Blood layers dependently (posteriorly in a supine patient). A tube directed anteriorly drains air but not blood. For hemothorax, direct the tube posteriorly and inferiorly. For pneumothorax, direct anteriorly and superiorly.

4. **Clamping a chest tube in a patient with air leak.** Clamping a chest tube in a patient with ongoing pneumothorax risks converting it to tension pneumothorax. Never clamp a chest tube to "test" for air leak resolution while the patient has a known pneumothorax. The only exception is brief clamping during drainage system exchange.

5. **Failing to confirm all side holes are within the pleural space.** If the most proximal drainage hole is outside the chest wall, air enters the pleural space through the tube (iatrogenic pneumothorax) and drainage is ineffective. Advance the tube until the last hole is clearly within the chest, and confirm with CXR.

6. **Inadequate local anesthesia causing patient movement during insertion.** Liberal lidocaine infiltration (20-30 mL of 1% with epinephrine) to the skin, intercostal muscles, periosteum, and parietal pleura is essential. Patient movement during insertion increases the risk of malposition and organ injury.

7. **Not recognizing massive hemothorax as an indication for surgical intervention.** Initial output > 1500 mL or ongoing output > 200 mL/hr for 4 hours indicates active hemorrhage requiring thoracotomy. A chest tube alone does not stop the bleeding — it only drains it. Failure to involve surgery promptly is lethal.
