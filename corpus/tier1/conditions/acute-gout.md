# Acute Gout and Pseudogout (Crystal Arthropathies)

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute inflammatory arthritis caused by deposition of crystals in the joint space. Gout results from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition; pseudogout (CPPD disease) results from calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition. Both present as acute monoarthritis and must be distinguished from septic arthritis by synovial fluid analysis.

### Gout

- **Pathophysiology:** Hyperuricemia leads to MSU crystal deposition in joints and soft tissues. Acute flare triggered by crystal shedding into joint space, activating NLRP3 inflammasome and neutrophilic inflammation.
- **Demographics:** Male predominance (4:1); peak incidence age 40-60; rare in premenopausal women (estrogen is uricosuric).
- **Classic presentation:** Explosive onset of severe monoarticular pain reaching peak intensity within 12-24 hours. Joint is erythematous, swollen, warm, exquisitely tender — even light touch (bedsheet contact) is intolerable.
- **Distribution:** 1st MTP joint (podagra) in ~50% of first attacks and ~70% over disease lifetime. Also midfoot, ankle, knee, wrist, finger MCP/PIP, olecranon bursa.
- **Crystal identification:** Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent under compensated polarized microscopy (yellow when parallel to the compensator axis).
- **Triggers:** Alcohol (beer > spirits > wine), purine-rich diet (red meat, shellfish, organ meats), dehydration, surgery, acute illness, trauma, diuretics (thiazides, loop), cyclosporine, initiation or dose change of urate-lowering therapy.
- **Risk factors:** Hyperuricemia (serum urate > 6.8 mg/dL, the saturation threshold), obesity, chronic kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, organ transplant recipients.
- **Tophi:** Firm, chalky deposits of MSU crystals in soft tissue (helix of ear, olecranon, Achilles tendon, finger pads). Indicate chronic tophaceous gout. Not present in first attacks.

### Pseudogout (CPPD Disease)

- **Pathophysiology:** Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals deposit in articular cartilage (chondrocalcinosis) and shed into joint space, causing acute inflammation.
- **Demographics:** Primarily patients > 60 years; prevalence increases with age. No strong sex predilection.
- **Classic presentation:** Acute monoarthritis, typically knee (most common) or wrist. Less explosive onset than gout (hours to days). Can mimic gout or septic arthritis.
- **Crystal identification:** Rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent under compensated polarized microscopy (blue when parallel to the compensator axis).
- **Associated conditions:** Hyperparathyroidism, hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatasia, hypothyroidism, Gitelman syndrome. Screen for metabolic causes in patients < 60 with CPPD.
- **Chondrocalcinosis on X-ray:** Linear calcification within articular cartilage (knee menisci, triangular fibrocartilage of wrist, pubic symphysis). Present in ~40% of patients > 80 years — not all develop symptomatic pseudogout.

### Key Distinguishing Features

| Feature | Gout | Pseudogout (CPPD) |
|---------|------|--------------------|
| Crystal shape | Needle-shaped | Rhomboid |
| Birefringence | Negatively birefringent (yellow parallel) | Weakly positively birefringent (blue parallel) |
| Most common joint | 1st MTP (podagra) | Knee, wrist |
| Typical age | 40-60 years (men) | > 60 years |
| X-ray finding | Erosions, tophi (chronic) | Chondrocalcinosis |
| Serum urate | Often elevated (but normal in 40% during acute flare) | Normal |
| Triggers | Dietary, alcohol, diuretics, surgery | Acute illness, surgery, trauma |

## Critical Actions

1. **Aspirate the joint if any suspicion of septic arthritis.** Septic arthritis and crystal arthropathy can coexist (1-5% of cases). Fever, immunosuppression, overlying skin break, prosthetic joint, or failure to improve on anti-inflammatory therapy mandates arthrocentesis. Send synovial fluid for cell count with differential, Gram stain, culture, and crystal analysis. See [septic-arthritis.md](septic-arthritis.md).
2. **Do not rely on serum urate to diagnose or exclude gout.** Serum urate is normal (< 6.8 mg/dL) in up to 40% of patients during an acute flare due to uricosuric effect of acute inflammation. An elevated urate supports but does not confirm gout; a normal urate does not exclude it.
3. **Start anti-inflammatory therapy early.** Treatment is most effective when initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset. Delay beyond 24-36 hours reduces response to all agents.
4. **Choose therapy based on comorbidities and contraindications** (see Treatment). No single agent is universally first-line.
5. **Do not initiate or discontinue urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol, febuxostat) during an acute flare.** Starting allopurinol during a flare can prolong or worsen the attack. Patients already on urate-lowering therapy should continue their current dose.
6. **Obtain X-ray of the affected joint.** Identify chondrocalcinosis (supports CPPD), erosions (chronic gout), and exclude fracture or osteomyelitis.
7. **Consider metabolic workup for CPPD in patients < 60.** Check calcium, PTH, iron studies, ferritin, magnesium, phosphate, TSH.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Septic arthritis** | Fever (60%), acutely hot joint, unable to bear weight, WBC often > 50,000 with > 90% PMNs; positive Gram stain/culture. CRITICAL: can coexist with crystal arthropathy -- always send cultures if infection suspected. See [septic-arthritis.md](septic-arthritis.md) |
| Cellulitis/periarticular soft tissue infection | Spreading erythema beyond joint margins, skin warmth without joint effusion, no pain with passive ROM through full arc |
| Reactive arthritis | Oligoarthritis 1-4 weeks post-GI or GU infection; sterile joint; conjunctivitis, urethritis, enthesitis; HLA-B27 |
| Rheumatoid arthritis flare | Symmetric polyarthritis, chronic history, positive RF/anti-CCP; sterile fluid |
| Traumatic hemarthrosis | History of trauma; bloody synovial aspirate; lipohemarthrosis = intra-articular fracture |
| Psoriatic arthritis | Dactylitis ("sausage digit"), nail pitting, psoriatic plaques, DIP involvement |
| Lyme arthritis | Monoarthritis (knee) in endemic area, history of tick bite or erythema migrans, positive Lyme serologies |
| Osteoarthritis flare | Mechanical pain, chronic history, synovial WBC < 2,000, osteophytes on X-ray |
| Fracture | Trauma history, point tenderness over bone, deformity; X-ray diagnostic |
| Bursitis (olecranon, prepatellar) | Swelling over bursa, not within joint space; full passive ROM of adjacent joint preserved |

## Workup

### Synovial Fluid Analysis (Definitive Diagnostic Test)

**Arthrocentesis indications:** First presentation of acute monoarthritis, any suspicion of infection, diagnostic uncertainty, large effusion causing significant pain.

| Parameter | Normal | Non-inflammatory | Crystal Arthropathy | Septic |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|
| Appearance | Clear, straw-colored | Clear, yellow | Cloudy/turbid, yellow-white | Purulent, opaque |
| WBC/mm3 | < 200 | 200-2,000 | 2,000-100,000 (typically 15,000-75,000) | > 50,000 (often > 100,000) |
| PMN % | < 25% | < 25% | > 50% (often > 90%) | > 90% |
| Crystals | None | None | MSU (needle, neg birefringent) or CPP (rhomboid, pos birefringent) | May have crystals if coexistent |
| Gram stain | Negative | Negative | Negative | Positive 50-75% |
| Culture | Negative | Negative | Negative | Positive 70-90% |

**Overlap zone:** Crystal arthropathy can produce WBC > 50,000 with > 90% PMNs, mimicking septic arthritis. The presence of crystals does NOT exclude concurrent infection. Always send cultures.

### Laboratory Studies

- **Serum urate:** Supports gout diagnosis if elevated (> 6.8 mg/dL), but normal in 40% during acute flare. Not diagnostic alone.
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis common in both crystal arthropathy and septic arthritis (nonspecific).
- **CRP/ESR:** Elevated in acute flare (nonspecific). CRP > 100 mg/L raises concern for septic arthritis.
- **BMP/creatinine:** Baseline renal function before prescribing NSAIDs or colchicine. Gout is associated with CKD.
- **Blood cultures:** If septic arthritis suspected.
- **Metabolic panel for CPPD (patients < 60):** Calcium, PTH, iron/ferritin/TIBC, magnesium, phosphate, TSH.

### Imaging

- **X-ray:** First-line. In gout: soft tissue swelling acutely; punched-out erosions with overhanging edges (chronic/tophaceous). In CPPD: chondrocalcinosis (linear cartilage calcification in knee menisci, triangular fibrocartilage of wrist, pubic symphysis).
- **Ultrasound:** "Double contour sign" (hyperechoic line over articular cartilage surface) is specific for MSU deposition. Can identify tophi and effusion.
- **Dual-energy CT (DECT):** Highly specific for MSU crystal detection (color-coded urate deposits). Not standard ED workup but useful in diagnostic uncertainty.

## Treatment

### NSAID Therapy (First-Line if No Contraindications)

- **Indomethacin 50 mg PO TID x 5-7 days** then taper
- **Naproxen 500 mg PO BID x 5-7 days** then taper
- Equally effective for gout and pseudogout
- Contraindications: CKD (GFR < 30), active GI bleeding or high-risk peptic ulcer disease, heart failure, anticoagulation (relative), post-CABG
- Add PPI (omeprazole 20 mg PO daily) for GI prophylaxis in patients with ulcer risk factors

### Colchicine (First-Line Alternative)

- **Low-dose regimen per AGREE trial:** Colchicine 1.2 mg PO initially, then 0.6 mg PO one hour later (total 1.8 mg on day 1). Then 0.6 mg PO once or twice daily until flare resolves.
- Low-dose is as effective as high-dose with significantly fewer GI side effects (AGREE trial, PMID 20131255).
- Most effective when started within 12-36 hours of flare onset; diminishing benefit after 36 hours.
- **Dose adjustment for renal impairment:** GFR 30-60: reduce maintenance to 0.3 mg daily. GFR < 30 or dialysis: avoid or use single dose 0.6 mg with no repeat (risk of accumulation and toxicity).
- **Drug interactions:** CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitors (clarithromycin, ketoconazole, cyclosporine, ritonavir) dramatically increase colchicine levels -- reduce dose by 50% or avoid. Statins increase myopathy risk.
- Contraindications: severe renal impairment (GFR < 10) without dose adjustment, severe hepatic impairment, concurrent strong CYP3A4 inhibitor at full dose.

### Corticosteroids (For NSAID/Colchicine Contraindications)

**Systemic:**
- **Prednisone 40 mg PO daily x 5 days** then taper over 7-10 days (e.g., decrease by 5-10 mg every 2-3 days)
- **Methylprednisolone dose pack:** Alternative, but fixed taper may be too rapid
- Preferred in patients with CKD, GI bleeding risk, or heart failure

**Intra-articular (for monoarticular involvement, large accessible joints):**
- **Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg intra-articular** (knee, shoulder, ankle)
- **Triamcinolone acetonide 10-20 mg** for smaller joints (wrist, MCP, MTP)
- Provides rapid, targeted relief with minimal systemic effects
- MUST exclude septic arthritis before injecting corticosteroid -- aspirate and send cultures first; if suspicion for infection is low and fluid is sent for culture, injection at the time of aspiration is reasonable

**Intramuscular:**
- **Triamcinolone acetonide 60 mg IM x1:** For patients who cannot take PO medications
- May repeat in 24-48 hours if inadequate response

### Combination Therapy

- Colchicine + NSAID, or colchicine + corticosteroid: Recommended by ACR 2020 guidelines for severe or polyarticular flares
- NSAID + corticosteroid combination: generally avoid due to compounded GI toxicity

### Treatment Algorithm by Comorbidity

| Patient Profile | Recommended First-Line |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Healthy, no contraindications | NSAID (naproxen 500 mg BID or indomethacin 50 mg TID) |
| CKD (GFR < 30) | Corticosteroid (prednisone 40 mg PO daily or intra-articular triamcinolone) |
| Heart failure | Colchicine (low-dose) or corticosteroid; avoid NSAIDs |
| GI bleeding risk / anticoagulation | Colchicine (low-dose) or corticosteroid; avoid NSAIDs |
| On CYP3A4 inhibitor | NSAID or corticosteroid; avoid or reduce colchicine dose |
| Diabetes | Prefer NSAID or colchicine; corticosteroids worsen glycemic control |
| Monoarticular, large joint | Intra-articular triamcinolone 40 mg (avoids systemic side effects) |
| Polyarticular flare | Systemic corticosteroid + colchicine combination |

### Urate-Lowering Therapy (NOT for ED Initiation)

- **Do NOT start allopurinol, febuxostat, or probenecid during an acute flare.** Initiating or changing the dose of urate-lowering therapy during a flare can prolong the attack by mobilizing crystal deposits.
- **Do NOT stop ongoing urate-lowering therapy.** Patients already on allopurinol or febuxostat should continue their current dose through the flare.
- Refer to primary care or rheumatology for urate-lowering therapy initiation 2-4 weeks after flare resolution.
- Indications for urate-lowering therapy: >= 2 flares/year, tophi, urate nephrolithiasis, CKD stage >= 3 with urate > 9 mg/dL.

## Disposition

### Discharge (Majority of Patients)

- Acute gout and pseudogout are outpatient diagnoses in the absence of diagnostic uncertainty or septic arthritis concern
- **Discharge criteria:** Pain improving with initiated therapy, able to tolerate PO medications, septic arthritis excluded by aspiration or clinical assessment, no hemodynamic instability
- **Prescriptions:** Complete course of chosen anti-inflammatory (5-7 days NSAID with taper, colchicine regimen, or prednisone taper); PPI if NSAID prescribed with risk factors; adequate analgesic (acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h PRN as adjunct)
- **Follow-up:** Primary care or rheumatology within 1-2 weeks for: urate-lowering therapy discussion, dietary counseling, medication reconciliation (discontinue thiazides if possible)
- **Return precautions:** Fever, worsening despite 48 hours of therapy, involvement of additional joints, inability to tolerate PO medications

### Observation / Admission

- Diagnostic uncertainty (crystals not identified, infection not excluded, cultures pending)
- Concern for concurrent septic arthritis -- admit for IV antibiotics pending culture results (see [septic-arthritis.md](septic-arthritis.md))
- Polyarticular flare with inability to ambulate or perform self-care
- Intractable pain or vomiting despite ED therapy
- Significant comorbidities precluding safe outpatient management (uncontrolled diabetes with steroid use, severe CKD requiring monitored colchicine dosing)

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming crystal-positive synovial fluid excludes septic arthritis.** Gout/pseudogout and septic arthritis coexist in 1-5% of cases. The presence of urate or CPP crystals does not rule out concurrent infection. If there is any clinical suspicion for infection (fever, immunosuppression, recent procedure, overlying skin break), send cultures and treat empirically for septic arthritis until cultures are negative at 48-72 hours.

2. **Using serum urate to diagnose or exclude an acute gout flare.** Serum urate is normal in up to 40% of patients during an acute attack (interleukin-mediated uricosuria). Conversely, asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and does not confirm that the current presentation is gout. Definitive diagnosis requires synovial fluid crystal analysis.

3. **Starting allopurinol during an acute flare.** Initiating urate-lowering therapy during an active flare can paradoxically worsen and prolong the attack by mobilizing MSU crystals from tissue deposits into the joint space. Defer initiation to 2-4 weeks after flare resolution. Patients already on urate-lowering therapy should continue unchanged.

4. **Prescribing high-dose colchicine.** The old regimen (0.6 mg hourly until GI toxicity) is toxic and no longer recommended. The AGREE trial demonstrated that low-dose colchicine (1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later) is equally effective with significantly fewer GI side effects. Colchicine toxicity (diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, multiorgan failure at supratherapeutic doses) is dose-dependent.

5. **Giving NSAIDs to patients with CKD, heart failure, or active GI bleeding.** NSAIDs are first-line for gout only in the absence of contraindications. In CKD (GFR < 30), NSAIDs precipitate acute kidney injury. In heart failure, they cause sodium retention and decompensation. In GI bleeding, they worsen hemorrhage. Use colchicine or corticosteroids in these populations.

6. **Failing to consider pseudogout in elderly patients with acute knee or wrist arthritis.** CPPD is underdiagnosed. In patients > 65 with acute monoarthritis of the knee or wrist, pseudogout is as likely as gout. Look for chondrocalcinosis on X-ray. Crystal analysis is required for definitive diagnosis.

7. **Injecting intra-articular corticosteroid without first aspirating and sending cultures.** If septic arthritis is in the differential, injecting corticosteroid into an infected joint worsens outcomes. Aspirate first, send fluid for cell count, Gram stain, culture, and crystals. If infection is excluded clinically and cultures are pending, injection at time of aspiration is acceptable with culture follow-up.

8. **Forgetting colchicine drug interactions.** Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, ketoconazole, HIV protease inhibitors, cyclosporine) or P-glycoprotein inhibitors with colchicine dramatically increases colchicine levels, leading to toxicity (pancytopenia, rhabdomyolysis, multiorgan failure). Reduce colchicine dose by at least 50% or choose an alternative agent.

9. **Attributing the first episode of monoarthritis in a young patient to gout without aspiration.** First presentations of acute monoarthritis require arthrocentesis to confirm the diagnosis. Gout is a clinical mimic of septic arthritis. Clinical features alone cannot reliably distinguish the two. Tap the joint.

10. **Discharging a patient without a clear follow-up plan for culture results.** If synovial fluid was aspirated and sent for culture, there must be a documented plan for culture follow-up (callback system, 48-hour recheck). Synovial fluid cultures take 24-72 hours. A patient discharged with "gout" whose cultures return positive for bacteria needs urgent re-evaluation.
