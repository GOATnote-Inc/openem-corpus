# Hypoglycemia

## Recognition

**Definition (Whipple's Triad):**
1. Symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia
2. Low plasma glucose at time of symptoms (< 70 mg/dL symptomatic; < 54 mg/dL clinically significant)
3. Resolution of symptoms with glucose correction

**Neuroglycopenic Symptoms (glucose < 50 mg/dL):**
- Confusion, difficulty concentrating, slurred speech
- Bizarre behavior, combativeness, agitation
- Seizures (focal or generalized)
- Focal neurologic deficits (hemiparesis mimicking stroke)
- Coma

**Adrenergic/Autonomic Symptoms (glucose 50-70 mg/dL):**
- Diaphoresis, tremor, palpitations, anxiety
- Hunger, nausea
- Paresthesias (perioral, fingertips)
- Tachycardia, widened pulse pressure

**Hypoglycemia Unawareness:** Patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (especially type 1 diabetes, long-standing type 2) lose adrenergic warning symptoms. First presentation is neuroglycopenia or seizure.

**Common Causes in ED:**
- Insulin or sulfonylurea overdose (intentional or accidental)
- Missed meals in insulin-dependent diabetics
- Renal failure (decreased insulin clearance)
- Hepatic failure (decreased gluconeogenesis)
- Sepsis
- Adrenal insufficiency
- Alcohol ingestion (blocks gluconeogenesis)
- Non-diabetic: insulinoma, surreptitious insulin use, medication errors

## Critical Actions

1. **Point-of-care glucose** — obtain immediately on any patient with altered mental status, seizure, focal deficits, or bizarre behavior. Do not wait for lab glucose.
2. **IV dextrose** — D50W 25-50 g (50-100 mL) IV push for glucose < 60 mg/dL with neuroglycopenic symptoms. Pediatric: D25W 2-4 mL/kg (neonates: D10W 5 mL/kg).
3. **Glucagon 1 mg IM/SC/IN** — if no IV access. Onset 10-15 min. Ineffective in hepatic failure, alcohol-related hypoglycemia, or glycogen-depleted states.
4. **Recheck glucose q15 min** — repeat dextrose bolus if glucose remains < 70 mg/dL or symptoms persist.
5. **Start D10W infusion** — 100-150 mL/hr after initial bolus for sustained correction, especially in sulfonylurea or long-acting insulin overdose.
6. **Identify and treat the cause** — review medication list, check renal/hepatic function, cortisol if adrenal crisis suspected.
7. **Oral carbohydrates** — 15-20 g fast-acting carbohydrate once patient alert and can swallow safely.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Stroke/TIA | Focal deficits, but glucose normal; hypoglycemia can mimic stroke exactly — always check glucose before CT |
| Postictal state | Witnessed seizure, but hypoglycemia itself causes seizures — check glucose regardless |
| Alcohol intoxication | Ethanol odor, but alcohol causes hypoglycemia — check glucose in all intoxicated patients |
| Sepsis | Fever, hemodynamic instability; hypoglycemia is a late sign of sepsis |
| Drug intoxication (opioids, benzodiazepines) | Toxidrome features, pinpoint pupils; co-occurring hypoglycemia possible |
| Psychogenic unresponsiveness | Normal vitals, normal glucose, inconsistent exam findings |
| Diabetic ketoacidosis | Hyperglycemia, anion gap, Kussmaul breathing — opposite glucose derangement |
| Adrenal crisis | Hypotension, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia; hypoglycemia often co-occurs |

## Workup

**Immediate:**
- Point-of-care glucose (fingerstick) — the single most important test
- Serum glucose confirmation (venous sample)

**Identify Cause:**
- BMP — renal function, electrolytes (hyponatremia in adrenal crisis)
- Hepatic panel — ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, INR
- Insulin level, C-peptide, proinsulin — draw BEFORE glucose correction if non-diabetic hypoglycemia suspected (insulinoma workup)
- Beta-hydroxybutyrate — suppressed in insulin-mediated hypoglycemia
- Sulfonylurea screen — if surreptitious use or medication error suspected
- Cortisol level — if adrenal insufficiency suspected (random cortisol < 3 mcg/dL diagnostic)
- Ethanol level
- TSH if clinical suspicion for myxedema
- Septic workup if febrile

**Imaging:** CT head if focal deficits persist after glucose correction (rule out concurrent stroke).

## Treatment

**Acute Glucose Correction:**
- D50W 25 g (50 mL) IV push — repeat in 5-10 min if glucose remains < 70 mg/dL
- Pediatric: D25W 2-4 mL/kg IV; neonates: D10W 5 mL/kg IV
- Glucagon 1 mg IM/SC/intranasal if no IV access (ineffective in liver failure or alcohol-related)

**Sustained Correction:**
- D10W continuous infusion 100-150 mL/hr — mandatory for sulfonylurea and long-acting insulin-induced hypoglycemia
- Dextrose-containing maintenance fluids (D5NS) once glucose stable > 100 mg/dL

**Sulfonylurea-Specific:**
- Octreotide 50-100 mcg SC q6-8h — inhibits endogenous insulin release. First-line adjunct for sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia. Prevents rebound hypoglycemia far more effectively than repeated dextrose boluses alone.
- Prolonged monitoring required (12-24+ hours) — sulfonylurea half-lives range 12-60 hours

**Insulin Overdose:**
- Short-acting insulin: observe 4-6 hours minimum
- Long-acting insulin (glargine, detemir, degludec): observe 12-24+ hours with continuous glucose monitoring
- Massive subcutaneous injection: surgical excision of injection site depot has been reported for intentional massive overdose

**Alcohol-Related Hypoglycemia:**
- Thiamine 100 mg IV BEFORE dextrose (prevent Wernicke encephalopathy)
- Dextrose infusion — glucagon is ineffective (glycogen stores depleted)
- Replete magnesium and potassium

## Disposition

**Discharge (if ALL criteria met):**
- Glucose stable > 100 mg/dL for 2+ hours without dextrose infusion
- Cause identified (missed meal, short-acting insulin dose error)
- Alert, tolerating oral intake
- No sulfonylurea involvement
- No intentional overdose
- Reliable follow-up

**Observe (minimum 12-24 hours):**
- Sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia (rebound hypoglycemia is the rule)
- Long-acting insulin overdose
- Unknown cause of hypoglycemia
- Recurrent hypoglycemia despite treatment

**Admit (ICU for):**
- Intentional overdose with suicidal intent — psychiatry consultation after medical clearance
- Persistent neuroglycopenia despite glucose correction (suggests prolonged neuronal injury)
- Refractory hypoglycemia requiring continuous dextrose infusion

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Adjust insulin/oral hypoglycemic dosing with PCP follow-up within 48-72 hours
- Prescribe glucagon kit
- Hypoglycemia unawareness counseling (target higher glucose goals)
- Medic alert identification

## Pitfalls

1. **Not checking glucose on every patient with altered mental status.** Hypoglycemia is the most common reversible cause of altered mental status. A fingerstick takes 5 seconds and prevents missed diagnosis.

2. **Discharging sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycemia after a single dextrose bolus.** Sulfonylureas have half-lives of 12-60 hours. Patients bounce back with recurrent severe hypoglycemia hours later. Mandatory 12-24 hour observation with octreotide.

3. **Bolus D50W without starting a dextrose infusion.** A single 25 g dextrose bolus raises glucose transiently. Without continuous infusion, glucose falls again within 30-60 minutes in sulfonylurea and long-acting insulin cases.

4. **Attributing altered mental status to intoxication without checking glucose.** Alcohol inhibits gluconeogenesis. Intoxicated patients are at high risk for concurrent hypoglycemia. Always check glucose.

5. **Giving dextrose before thiamine in malnourished or alcoholic patients.** Dextrose administration in thiamine-depleted patients precipitates Wernicke encephalopathy. Give thiamine 100 mg IV first.

6. **Hypoglycemia mimicking stroke — going straight to CT without checking glucose.** Hypoglycemia causes hemiparesis, aphasia, and other focal deficits indistinguishable from stroke. A 5-second fingerstick must precede imaging. Stroke protocols should mandate glucose check.

7. **Missing intentional insulin overdose.** A non-diabetic presenting with hypoglycemia or a diabetic with repeated "accidental" hypoglycemia warrants insulin/C-peptide/sulfonylurea screen. Low C-peptide with high insulin = exogenous insulin administration.

8. **Underestimating long-acting insulin overdose duration.** Glargine and degludec have durations of 24-42 hours. Patients need prolonged observation (24+ hours) even if initial correction is easy. Premature discharge leads to hypoglycemic coma at home.

9. **Not considering non-diabetic causes.** Sepsis, adrenal crisis, hepatic failure, and insulinoma all cause hypoglycemia. A non-diabetic with unexplained hypoglycemia requires a structured workup — not just dextrose and discharge.
