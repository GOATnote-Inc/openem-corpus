# Mitral Valve Prolapse — Acute Complications

## Recognition

**Acute mitral regurgitation from chordae rupture:**
- Sudden onset severe dyspnea, orthopnea
- Flash pulmonary edema (crackles bilaterally, hypoxia)
- New harsh systolic murmur (may be soft or absent in severe acute MR due to rapid equalization of LA and LV pressures)
- Hypotension, tachycardia, cardiogenic shock
- History of known MVP with mid-systolic click

**Arrhythmias:**
- Ventricular ectopy (PVCs) — common, usually benign
- Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia — rare but life-threatening
- Atrial fibrillation from chronic LA enlargement due to MR
- Sudden cardiac death (very rare, < 1% per year in high-risk subset)

**Infective endocarditis:**
- MVP with MR is a risk factor for IE (especially mitral regurgitation with thickened leaflets)
- Fever, new or changed murmur, embolic phenomena
- Osler nodes, Janeway lesions, splinter hemorrhages

**Stroke/TIA:**
- Paradoxical embolism through associated PFO/ASD
- Thrombus on prolapsing leaflet (rare)
- Atrial fibrillation-related cardioembolism

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Bedside echo | < 15 minutes |
| ABG or SpO2 | Immediate |
| Cardiology/cardiac surgery consultation | < 30 minutes |
| Hemodynamic stabilization | Immediate |

1. **For acute severe MR (chordae rupture):**
   - Supplemental O2, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) for pulmonary edema
   - Afterload reduction: nitroprusside 0.25-5 mcg/kg/min IV (reduces regurgitant fraction by lowering SVR) — ONLY if SBP > 90
   - Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) — reduces afterload and improves forward cardiac output as bridge to surgery
   - Furosemide 40-80 mg IV for pulmonary edema
   - Emergent cardiac surgery consultation — mitral valve repair or replacement is definitive
2. **For cardiogenic shock:** Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV, dobutamine 2-20 mcg/kg/min IV, IABP
3. **For arrhythmias:** Treat per standard ACLS protocols; beta-blocker for symptomatic PVCs (metoprolol 5 mg IV)
4. **For suspected endocarditis:** Blood cultures x 3, empiric antibiotics per IE protocol

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute MI with papillary muscle rupture** — causes acute MR; check troponin, ECG for STEMI
- **Acute aortic regurgitation** — diastolic murmur, wide pulse pressure, aortic dissection on differential
- **Acute decompensated heart failure** — non-valvular causes (ischemic, hypertensive)
- **Tension pneumothorax** — acute dyspnea, hypotension, absent breath sounds
- **Pulmonary embolism** — acute dyspnea without new murmur
- **Panic disorder** — palpitations and dyspnea; MVP patients frequently misdiagnosed with anxiety

## Workup

- **Transthoracic echocardiography (urgent):** Assess degree of MR, leaflet mobility, chordae integrity, flail leaflet, LA/LV size, LV function, pulmonary artery pressure
- **Transesophageal echocardiography:** Superior for defining mechanism (which chordae, which leaflet) and surgical planning
- **ECG:** AF, ventricular arrhythmias, ST changes
- **Chest X-ray:** Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly
- **Labs:** BNP/NT-proBNP (elevated in HF), troponin (rule out MI), CBC, BMP, blood cultures if febrile
- **ABG:** If significant respiratory distress

## Treatment

### Acute Severe Mitral Regurgitation (Chordae Rupture)
- **Emergent surgery** — mitral valve repair preferred over replacement (better outcomes, avoids anticoagulation)
- Bridge to surgery:
  - Afterload reduction with nitroprusside 0.25-5 mcg/kg/min IV (target SBP 90-100)
  - IABP if available
  - BiPAP for pulmonary edema
  - Furosemide 40-80 mg IV
  - Avoid beta-blockers acutely (need compensatory tachycardia for cardiac output)

### Chronic Severe MR (Acute Decompensation)
- Diuresis: furosemide 40-80 mg IV
- Afterload reduction: ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat 1.25 mg IV) or nitroprusside
- Rate control for AF: diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV or metoprolol 5 mg IV
- Anticoagulation for AF per CHA2DS2-VASc

### Arrhythmia Management
- Symptomatic PVCs: metoprolol 25-50 mg PO BID
- Sustained VT: cardioversion if unstable; amiodarone 150 mg IV over 10 min if stable
- EP referral for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias

### Endocarditis Prophylaxis
- No longer recommended for MVP alone per 2007 AHA guidelines
- Only indicated for MVP with prosthetic valve material or prior IE

## Disposition

- **ICU admission:** Acute severe MR with hemodynamic compromise, cardiogenic shock, pending surgical intervention
- **Telemetry admission:** New severe MR without shock, symptomatic arrhythmias, suspected endocarditis
- **Discharge with urgent follow-up:** Known MVP with new palpitations but stable, no acute MR change on echo
- **Cardiac surgery referral:** All acute chordae rupture; chronic severe MR with symptoms or LV dysfunction (LVESD >= 40 mm or LVEF < 60%)

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming MVP is always benign.** While most MVP is clinically insignificant (2-3% prevalence), MVP with significant MR carries risk of chordae rupture, endocarditis, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. Thick, redundant leaflets (> 5 mm) and moderate-severe MR identify the high-risk subset.

2. **Missing acute severe MR because the murmur is soft.** In acute severe MR, the rapid equalization of pressures between LV and LA may produce only a brief, soft murmur rather than the classic loud pansystolic murmur of chronic MR. Flash pulmonary edema with a soft or absent murmur should raise suspicion.

3. **Diagnosing panic disorder in a patient with MVP and palpitations.** While MVP and anxiety disorders are often comorbid, new palpitations may represent ventricular arrhythmias. An ECG and Holter monitor should be obtained before attributing symptoms to anxiety.

4. **Using beta-blockers in acute severe MR with compromised cardiac output.** In acute MR, compensatory tachycardia maintains forward cardiac output. Beta-blockers reduce heart rate and worsen hemodynamics. Afterload reduction (nitroprusside, IABP) is the correct approach.

5. **Delaying surgical consultation for acute chordae rupture.** Acute severe MR from chordae rupture is a surgical emergency. Medical management is a bridge, not definitive treatment. Early repair (before LV decompensation) has superior outcomes.
