# Acute Limb Ischemia

## Recognition

**Definition:** Sudden decrease in limb perfusion threatening tissue viability, typically onset within 14 days. Distinct from chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), which develops over weeks to months.

**The 6 Ps:**
1. **Pain** — sudden onset, severe, distal, progresses proximally. Rest pain that worsens with elevation.
2. **Pallor** — waxy white or mottled appearance. Progresses to cyanosis.
3. **Pulselessness** — absent distal pulses (dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial). Compare with contralateral limb.
4. **Paresthesias** — early neurological deficit. Loss of light touch sensation (large fiber dysfunction).
5. **Paralysis** — late finding indicating muscle ischemia. Motor deficit = limb-threatening.
6. **Poikilothermia** — cool to touch relative to contralateral limb. Identify the temperature demarcation level.

**Not all 6 Ps are present simultaneously.** Pain and pulselessness are the earliest and most consistent findings. Paralysis and paresthesia indicate advanced ischemia.

**Etiology:**
- **Embolism (70-80%):** cardiac source in >80% of cases. Atrial fibrillation (most common), recent MI with mural thrombus, prosthetic valve, endocarditis, paradoxical embolism, aortic atheroma. Abrupt onset, no antecedent claudication, contralateral pulses normal.
- **Thrombosis (20-30%):** in situ thrombosis of atherosclerotic vessel or bypass graft. More insidious onset, history of PAD/claudication, contralateral pulses diminished.
- **Other:** popliteal aneurysm thrombosis, arterial dissection, trauma, iatrogenic (catheterization), hypercoagulable states.

**Rutherford Classification (guides urgency):**

| Class | Category | Sensory Loss | Motor Deficit | Arterial Doppler | Venous Doppler |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| I | Viable | None | None | Audible | Audible |
| IIa | Marginally threatened | Minimal (toes) | None | Often inaudible | Audible |
| IIb | Immediately threatened | Beyond toes, rest pain | Mild-moderate | Usually inaudible | Audible |
| III | Irreversible | Profound, anesthetic | Profound, paralysis (rigor) | Inaudible | Inaudible |

**Class III (irreversible) = amputation.** Revascularization of irreversibly ischemic muscle causes fatal reperfusion syndrome (hyperkalemia, myoglobinuric renal failure, ARDS).

## Critical Actions

1. **Systemic anticoagulation with heparin immediately upon diagnosis.** Unfractionated heparin 80 units/kg IV bolus, then 18 units/kg/hr infusion. Goal: prevent thrombus propagation. Do NOT delay for imaging.
2. **Emergent vascular surgery consultation** — call before completing workup. Time is muscle.
3. **Assess Rutherford class** — determines whether the limb is viable, threatened, or irreversible. Handheld Doppler at bedside for arterial and venous signals.
4. **Keep the limb in dependent position** — gravity-assisted perfusion. Do NOT elevate the ischemic limb.
5. **Avoid heat application** — ischemic tissue is vulnerable to thermal injury.
6. **CTA for anatomic localization** if it does not delay intervention and Rutherford class IIa. Class IIb goes directly to OR or angiography suite.
7. **Obtain baseline labs** — CMP (potassium, creatinine, BUN), CBC, coagulation studies, lactate, CK, type and screen. Elevated CK and potassium indicate muscle necrosis.
8. **Continuous cardiac monitoring** — atrial fibrillation is the most common embolic source.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Acute deep vein thrombosis | Swelling, warmth, erythema (not pallor), pulses present, leg edema |
| Chronic limb-threatening ischemia | Gradual onset over weeks-months, tissue loss (ulcers, gangrene), rest pain chronic |
| Phlegmasia cerulea dolens | Massive DVT with secondary arterial compromise; swollen, cyanotic, tense limb; pulses may be absent |
| Aortic dissection with malperfusion | Tearing chest/back pain, pulse differential between extremities, widened mediastinum on CXR |
| Compartment syndrome | Tense compartments, pain with passive stretch, may have pulses initially; follows trauma or reperfusion |
| Spinal cord compression | Bilateral weakness, sensory level, bladder dysfunction, no pulse deficit |
| Peripheral neuropathy | Chronic, symmetric, no pulse deficit, no acute pallor |
| Ergotism | Vasospasm from ergot alkaloids, bilateral, history of migraine medication use |

## Workup

**Bedside:**
- Handheld continuous-wave Doppler — assess arterial signals at dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial. Compare with contralateral limb. Absence of venous Doppler signal = Rutherford III.
- Ankle-brachial index (ABI) — ABI <0.4 consistent with severe ischemia. May be unobtainable.
- ECG — identify atrial fibrillation or recent MI as embolic source.

**Labs:**
- CMP — hyperkalemia (muscle necrosis), creatinine (baseline before contrast, reperfusion renal failure)
- CBC — baseline hematocrit, platelet count (HIT evaluation if prior heparin exposure)
- Coagulation studies — PT/INR, PTT (baseline before heparin, monitor during infusion)
- Lactate — elevated with tissue ischemia
- CK/myoglobin — elevated indicates muscle necrosis; CK >5,000 U/L predicts compartment syndrome and renal failure after reperfusion
- Type and screen — anticipate surgery
- Troponin — if cardiac embolism suspected
- Hypercoagulability panel — for recurrence workup (not acutely actionable but draw before anticoagulation)

**Imaging:**
- **CTA (CT angiography)** — first-line imaging for anatomic localization, identifies site and extent of occlusion, distinguishes embolism from thrombosis, evaluates inflow/outflow vessels for surgical planning. Obtain if it does not delay revascularization.
- **Conventional angiography** — gold standard; performed in the angiography suite with intent to intervene (catheter-directed thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy).
- **Duplex ultrasound** — can confirm occlusion at bedside but does not provide full anatomic roadmap.
- **Echocardiography (TTE/TEE)** — identify cardiac source of embolism. Not emergent but obtain during admission.

## Treatment

**Immediate:**
- Unfractionated heparin 80 units/kg IV bolus, then 18 units/kg/hr infusion (check PTT at 6 hours, target 60-80 seconds or 1.5-2.5x control)
- Adequate IV hydration — NS at 150-250 mL/hr to maintain urine output >1 mL/kg/hr (renal protection against myoglobin)
- Pain management — morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV titrated, or fentanyl 0.5-1 mcg/kg IV. Adequate analgesia; severe pain is the rule.
- Keep limb in dependent position, pad pressure points, avoid compression

**Revascularization Strategy (determined by vascular surgery):**

*Rutherford I (viable):*
- Anticoagulation and observation
- Elective workup and revascularization

*Rutherford IIa (marginally threatened):*
- CTA for anatomic planning
- Catheter-directed thrombolysis (alteplase 0.5-1 mg/hr intra-arterial, typical 12-24 hour infusion) — preferred for thrombosis and distal/small vessel disease
- Surgical embolectomy with balloon catheter (Fogarty) — preferred for proximal embolism
- Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy — adjunct or alternative

*Rutherford IIb (immediately threatened):*
- Emergent surgical embolectomy (Fogarty catheter thromboembolectomy) — first-line for embolism
- Surgical bypass — for thrombosis with underlying severe PAD
- No time for prolonged thrombolysis; revascularize in OR

*Rutherford III (irreversible):*
- Primary amputation. Revascularization is contraindicated — reperfusion of necrotic muscle causes lethal metabolic derangement (hyperkalemia → cardiac arrest, myoglobinuric renal failure, metabolic acidosis, ARDS).

**Post-Revascularization Monitoring:**
- **Compartment syndrome** — monitor for tense compartments, pain out of proportion, pain with passive stretch for 24-48 hours. Fasciotomy threshold: compartment pressure >30 mmHg or within 30 mmHg of diastolic pressure.
- **Reperfusion injury** — check potassium, CK, lactate, and renal function every 4-6 hours for 24 hours. Treat hyperkalemia aggressively (calcium gluconate 3 g IV, insulin 10 units + D50 50 mL IV, sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq IV if acidotic).
- **Myoglobinuria** — maintain urine output >200 mL/hr with aggressive crystalloid. Urine alkalinization (sodium bicarbonate 150 mEq in 1 L D5W) to keep urine pH >6.5.
- Continuous telemetry monitoring
- Prophylactic fasciotomy at time of revascularization if ischemia time >4-6 hours

## Disposition

**Emergent Operative/Interventional:**
- Rutherford IIb — direct to OR or interventional suite
- Rutherford IIa — admit to vascular surgery, intervene within hours

**ICU Admission:**
- Post-revascularization for reperfusion monitoring (minimum 24 hours)
- Compartment syndrome requiring fasciotomy
- Hemodynamically unstable
- Significant metabolic derangement (hyperkalemia, acidosis)

**Vascular Surgery Floor:**
- Rutherford I with stable anticoagulation
- Post-successful embolectomy without reperfusion complications

**Transfer:**
- If vascular surgery not available on-site, transfer emergently. Begin heparin before transfer. Do not delay transfer for imaging.

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying heparin anticoagulation.** Heparin prevents clot propagation and must be started immediately upon clinical suspicion, before imaging. Every hour without anticoagulation allows the thrombus to extend and collateral vessels to occlude.

2. **Waiting for CTA results before calling vascular surgery.** Parallel processing is essential. A Rutherford IIb limb loses viable muscle while awaiting scan acquisition and radiologist interpretation. Call vascular surgery at the time of clinical diagnosis.

3. **Elevating the ischemic limb.** Gravity is the only perfusion source for tissue distal to the occlusion. Elevating the limb (as done for DVT) worsens ischemia. Keep the limb dependent or level.

4. **Attempting revascularization of a Rutherford III limb.** An anesthetic, paralyzed, rigid limb with absent venous Doppler signals has irreversible muscle necrosis. Revascularization releases a lethal bolus of potassium, myoglobin, and acid into the systemic circulation. Primary amputation is the treatment.

5. **Failing to monitor for reperfusion injury.** Even successful revascularization carries 10-15% mortality from reperfusion syndrome. Serial potassium, CK, lactate, and renal function monitoring for 24-48 hours post-revascularization is mandatory.

6. **Missing atrial fibrillation as the embolic source.** Acute limb ischemia is often the first presentation of previously undiagnosed atrial fibrillation. A 12-lead ECG and continuous telemetry identify the underlying arrhythmia and guide long-term anticoagulation to prevent recurrent embolism.

7. **Forgetting to assess the contralateral limb.** Shower emboli can affect multiple vascular beds simultaneously. Examine both legs, check bilateral femoral and upper extremity pulses, and assess for signs of mesenteric or renal embolism (abdominal pain, hematuria).

8. **Underestimating compartment syndrome risk after reperfusion.** Compartment syndrome develops in 10-20% of patients after revascularization, particularly when ischemia time exceeds 4-6 hours. Prophylactic fasciotomy at the time of surgery is appropriate for prolonged ischemia.

9. **Attributing ALI to DVT.** DVT causes swelling, warmth, and erythema with preserved pulses. ALI causes pallor, coolness, and absent pulses. Misdiagnosis delays anticoagulation and revascularization. The clinical presentations are opposite — this error reflects inadequate vascular examination.
