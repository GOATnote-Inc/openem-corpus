# Joint Arthrocentesis

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Acute monoarthritis — must rule out septic arthritis (a surgical emergency)
- Suspected crystal arthropathy (gout, pseudogout) — diagnosis requires synovial fluid crystal analysis
- Traumatic effusion — rule out hemarthrosis, lipohemarthrosis (intra-articular fracture)
- Therapeutic drainage of large tense effusion causing pain or limiting motion
- Suspected hemarthrosis (coagulopathy, post-traumatic)

**Key Clinical Question:** Is this septic arthritis? Septic arthritis requires emergent surgical washout — every hour of delay increases joint destruction.

**Contraindications:**
- Overlying cellulitis or skin infection at the intended needle entry site (risk of introducing bacteria into the joint)
- Prosthetic joint: relative — use strict sterile technique; low threshold for orthopedic consultation and aspiration in OR
- Severe coagulopathy (INR > 3, platelets < 20K): relative — correct if possible, but do not delay if septic arthritis is suspected
- Bacteremia (relative): may seed the joint; weigh risk-benefit

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Clinical assessment | Determine probability of septic arthritis |
| Arthrocentesis | Before antibiotics if possible (antibiotics can sterilize cultures within hours) |
| Fluid sent for analysis | Cell count, Gram stain, culture, crystals |
| Empiric antibiotics | Within 1 hour of suspicion if septic arthritis likely (do NOT delay for arthrocentesis if it will take > 1 hour) |

1. **Assess for septic arthritis** — acute monoarthritis, fever, inability to bear weight, immunocompromised, prior joint surgery
2. **Identify joint and approach** — knee (easiest), shoulder, ankle, wrist, elbow, hip (US-guided)
3. **Perform arthrocentesis** under sterile technique
4. **Send fluid** for cell count + differential, Gram stain, culture, crystal analysis
5. **Interpret results** — see fluid analysis below
6. **Administer empiric antibiotics** if septic arthritis suspected

## Differential Diagnosis

**Acute Monoarthritis Differential:**

| Diagnosis | Key Features | Synovial Fluid |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Septic arthritis | Fever, acute onset, inability to bear weight, warm/erythematous joint | WBC > 50,000; PMN > 90%; Gram stain + (40-60%); culture + |
| Gout | Acute onset, podagra (1st MTP common), prior episodes, tophi | WBC 15,000-75,000; negatively birefringent needle-shaped crystals (MSU) |
| Pseudogout (CPPD) | Elderly, knee/wrist common, acute onset | WBC 15,000-75,000; weakly positively birefringent rhomboid crystals (CPP) |
| Traumatic hemarthrosis | History of trauma; fat globules = occult fracture | Bloody; lipid layer suggests intra-articular fracture |
| Reactive arthritis | Post-infectious (GI, GU); HLA-B27 associated | WBC 5,000-50,000; sterile culture |
| Inflammatory (RA, psoriatic) | Chronic; polyarticular pattern; systemic features | WBC 5,000-50,000; no crystals |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- Joint examination: range of motion, warmth, effusion, erythema
- Ultrasound: identify effusion (anechoic or complex fluid within joint capsule), guide needle placement for small joints or minimal effusion
- Labs: CBC, ESR, CRP, blood cultures (if febrile), uric acid (gout; may be normal in acute flare)
- X-ray of the joint: evaluate for fracture, chondrocalcinosis (CPPD), osteomyelitis, joint destruction

**Equipment:**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Needle | 18-20g x 1.5 inch (knee, ankle); 22g x 1.5 inch (small joints) |
| Syringe | 20-60 mL (knee — large effusions); 5-10 mL (small joints) |
| Chlorhexidine | Skin prep |
| Sterile gloves | Mandatory |
| Lidocaine | 1% lidocaine 3-5 mL with 25g needle for skin/SC anesthesia |
| Specimen tubes | Purple top (cell count), green/gray (crystals), blood culture bottle (culture), extra tube if needed |
| Ultrasound | Linear probe for superficial joints; phased array for hip |
| Ethyl chloride spray | Topical anesthetic (optional) |

## Treatment

### Knee Arthrocentesis (Most Common)

**Approach: Superolateral (Preferred)**
1. Position: supine, knee extended or slightly flexed (10-20 degrees; towel roll under knee)
2. Identify landmarks: superior pole of patella → 1 cm superior and 1 cm lateral to the superolateral corner of the patella
3. Chlorhexidine skin prep, sterile drape
4. Lidocaine 1% 3-5 mL SC and into joint capsule using 25g needle
5. Insert 18g needle (attached to 20-60 mL syringe) directed 45 degrees inferiorly and medially, aiming beneath the patella
6. Advance until fluid is aspirated (typically 2-4 cm depth)
7. Aspirate as completely as possible
8. Remove needle, apply bandage

**Approach: Medial (Alternative)**
- 1 cm medial to the midpoint of the medial patellar border
- Direct needle perpendicular to the skin, posterior to the patella
- Useful when lateral approach is inaccessible

### Shoulder (Glenohumeral) Arthrocentesis

**Posterior Approach:**
1. Patient seated, arm in lap
2. Identify coracoid process (landmark) — entry point 2-3 cm inferior and 1 cm medial to the posterolateral corner of the acromion
3. Direct needle anteriorly and medially toward the coracoid process
4. Advance 3-5 cm until fluid returns
5. Ultrasound guidance strongly recommended (success 92-100% vs 27-73% landmark-based)

### Ankle Arthrocentesis

**Anteromedial Approach:**
1. Patient supine, ankle in neutral (slight plantar flexion)
2. Identify joint line: medial to the tibialis anterior tendon at the level of the joint
3. Insert needle at the joint line, directing posterolaterally
4. Advance until fluid returns (1-2 cm)

### Hip Arthrocentesis (US-Guided Mandatory)

- Ultrasound-guided anterior approach under fluoroscopy or US
- Identify femoral head-neck junction on US
- 20g spinal needle directed under real-time guidance
- Low threshold for orthopedic consultation — hip aspiration is technically challenging

### Synovial Fluid Analysis

| Parameter | Normal | Non-Inflammatory | Inflammatory | Septic |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| Appearance | Clear, straw | Clear to slightly cloudy | Cloudy, yellow | Purulent, opaque |
| WBC (/mm3) | < 200 | < 2,000 | 2,000-75,000 | > 50,000 (often > 100,000) |
| PMN % | < 25% | < 25% | 50-75% | > 90% |
| Gram stain | Negative | Negative | Negative | Positive (40-60%) |
| Culture | Negative | Negative | Negative | Positive (85-95%) |
| Crystals | Absent | Absent | MSU or CPP | Usually absent (can coexist) |

**Key thresholds:**
- WBC > 50,000 with > 90% PMN: treat as septic until proven otherwise
- WBC 25,000-50,000: high suspicion for septic; treat empirically if clinical picture supports
- Crystals present does NOT exclude septic arthritis — gout and septic arthritis coexist in 1-5% of cases

### Empiric Antibiotics for Suspected Septic Arthritis

| Population | Regimen |
|-----------|---------|
| Otherwise healthy adult | Cefazolin 2 g IV q8h (covers S. aureus, streptococci) |
| MRSA risk (IVDU, nursing home, prior MRSA) | Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q12h |
| Immunocompromised, elderly | Vancomycin + ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily (broader gram-negative coverage) |
| Gonococcal suspected (young, sexually active) | Ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily |
| Prosthetic joint | Vancomycin + cefepime 2 g IV q8h; orthopedic surgery consultation |

### Post-Procedure
- Send fluid for cell count, Gram stain, culture, crystal analysis
- Bandage the puncture site
- Document volume and character of fluid aspirated
- Monitor for re-accumulation (septic joints may require serial aspiration or surgical washout)

## Disposition

- **Septic arthritis (confirmed or suspected):** admission; orthopedic consultation for surgical washout; IV antibiotics
- **Crystal arthropathy (gout/pseudogout):** discharge with anti-inflammatory therapy (indomethacin 50 mg PO TID x 5 days, or colchicine 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg 1 hour later, or prednisone 40 mg PO daily x 5 days); rheumatology follow-up
- **Traumatic hemarthrosis:** orthopedic follow-up; immobilization; consider MRI for ligamentous injury
- **Lipohemarthrosis (fat globules):** intra-articular fracture — orthopedic consultation

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming gout excludes septic arthritis.** Gout and septic arthritis coexist in 1-5% of cases. A patient with known gout who presents with a joint that is more inflamed than their typical flare, or with systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis), requires arthrocentesis even if the clinical picture "looks like gout."

2. **Delaying arthrocentesis because of anticoagulation.** The risk of hemarthrosis from arthrocentesis in anticoagulated patients is low (< 1%). The risk of missing septic arthritis is death or permanent joint destruction. Arthrocentesis should NOT be delayed for anticoagulation reversal when septic arthritis is in the differential.

3. **Giving antibiotics before arthrocentesis.** Antibiotics can sterilize synovial fluid within 4-6 hours, rendering Gram stain and culture falsely negative. Aspirate the joint BEFORE antibiotics if possible. However, if arthrocentesis will be delayed > 1 hour, do NOT withhold antibiotics — start empirically and aspirate as soon as feasible.

4. **Using WBC count alone to rule out septic arthritis.** No single WBC threshold perfectly differentiates septic from non-septic arthritis. WBC < 50,000 does not exclude septic arthritis (10-20% of culture-positive septic arthritis has WBC < 50,000). Clinical context, Gram stain, and culture are essential.

5. **Not sending fluid for crystal analysis.** Crystal analysis requires polarized light microscopy and must be performed on fresh fluid (within 6 hours). If the lab cannot process crystals, the diagnosis of gout/pseudogout cannot be confirmed. Send the tube clearly labeled for crystal analysis and coordinate with the lab.

6. **Attempting hip arthrocentesis without ultrasound guidance.** The hip joint is deep and surrounded by critical neurovascular structures (femoral artery, nerve). Landmark-based hip aspiration has a high failure rate. Ultrasound guidance is mandatory. If US-guided aspiration is not available, consult orthopedics or interventional radiology.
