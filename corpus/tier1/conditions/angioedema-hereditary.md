# Hereditary Angioedema

## Recognition

**Key distinction from allergic/histamine-mediated angioedema:**
- **No urticaria** (no hives, no itching)
- **Does NOT respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids**
- Bradykinin-mediated, NOT histamine-mediated

**Presentation:**
- Recurrent episodes of non-pitting, non-pruritic subcutaneous or submucosal swelling
- Face, lips, tongue, extremities, genitalia, bowel wall
- Laryngeal edema (potentially fatal — occurs in ~50% of patients at some point)
- Abdominal attacks: severe colicky pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (mimics acute abdomen)
- Episodes last 2-5 days untreated; resolve spontaneously

**Types:**
- Type I (85%): low C4, low C1-INH level and function
- Type II (15%): low C4, normal C1-INH level but low function
- Type III (rare, estrogen-related): normal C1-INH; factor XII mutation

**Triggers:**
- Trauma (including dental procedures)
- Stress, infection
- ACE inhibitors (contraindicated in HAE)
- Estrogen (oral contraceptives, pregnancy)
- Surgery
- Often no identifiable trigger

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Assess airway | Immediately |
| Administer C1-INH concentrate or icatibant | < 30 minutes for laryngeal edema |
| Prepare for intubation/surgical airway | If any laryngeal involvement |
| Do NOT rely on epinephrine/antihistamines | Critical — they are ineffective |

1. **Assess airway** — voice change, stridor, drooling, tongue swelling, dysphagia indicate laryngeal involvement
2. **Administer targeted HAE therapy immediately** if laryngeal involvement or severe attack
3. **Prepare for difficult airway** — assemble intubation equipment, surgical airway kit; ENT if available
4. **Do NOT give epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids as primary therapy** — they do not work in HAE
5. **If patient carries their own medication** (icatibant auto-injector, C1-INH concentrate), assist with administration
6. **If HAE-specific medication is unavailable:** fresh frozen plasma 2 units IV (contains C1-INH; can be used as last resort)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Allergic angioedema (urticaria present, responds to epinephrine/antihistamines, IgE-mediated)
- ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema (bradykinin-mediated like HAE; does not respond to epinephrine; check medication list)
- Idiopathic angioedema (diagnosis of exclusion)
- Anaphylaxis (hypotension, urticaria, respiratory distress, allergen exposure)
- Superior vena cava syndrome (facial/upper extremity swelling, JVD, dyspnea)
- Cellulitis (erythema, warmth, tenderness, fever)
- Contact dermatitis (pruritic, erythematous, exposure history)
- Acute abdomen (HAE abdominal attacks mimic appendicitis, bowel obstruction — ultrasound shows bowel wall edema and ascites without surgical pathology)

## Workup

- **C4 level** — low during and between attacks (< 30% of normal is highly suggestive; normal C4 essentially rules out HAE types I and II)
- **C1-INH level and functional assay** — low in Type I (level and function); normal level but low function in Type II
- **CBC:** no eosinophilia (unlike allergic angioedema)
- **Tryptase:** normal (elevated in anaphylaxis/mast cell-mediated)
- **Abdominal ultrasound** (for abdominal attacks): bowel wall edema, ascites, no surgical pathology
- **CT abdomen** if surgical diagnosis cannot be excluded
- **Laryngoscopy** (flexible nasopharyngoscopy) if available — assess laryngeal edema severity

## Treatment

### Acute Laryngeal/Severe Attack (First-Line Options — Any One)
- **C1-INH concentrate (Berinert):** 20 units/kg IV — onset 30-60 minutes
- **Icatibant (Firazyr):** 30 mg SQ in abdominal wall — bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist; onset 30-90 minutes; may repeat at 6 hours if no response (max 3 doses/24 hours)
- **Ecallantide (Kalbitor):** 30 mg SQ (three 10 mg injections) — kallikrein inhibitor; must be administered by healthcare provider (anaphylaxis risk 3%); NOT approved for self-administration
- **Recombinant C1-INH (Ruconest):** 50 units/kg IV (max 4200 units) — onset 60-90 minutes; contraindicated in rabbit allergy

### If HAE-Specific Therapy Unavailable
- **Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) 2 units IV** — contains C1-INH; can worsen attack paradoxically in rare cases (provides substrate for kallikrein) but is preferred over no treatment
- **Solvent/detergent treated plasma** preferred over standard FFP if available
- **Tranexamic acid 1 g IV** — weak evidence; antifibrinolytic may reduce bradykinin generation

### Airway Management
- **Intubation** — early if laryngeal edema progressive; use smaller ETT (edematous supraglottic structures)
- **Cricothyrotomy** if intubation fails
- **Administer targeted therapy simultaneously with airway management** — edema may resolve within 30-90 minutes of treatment, allowing extubation

### Abdominal Attacks
- **Same targeted therapies** as laryngeal attacks (C1-INH concentrate, icatibant, or ecallantide)
- **IV NS for hydration** (vomiting/diarrhea-related dehydration)
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** for nausea
- **Ketorolac 30 mg IV** or **morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV** for pain
- **Avoid unnecessary surgery** — abdominal HAE attacks mimic acute abdomen but resolve with medical therapy

### DO NOT USE (Ineffective in HAE)
- Epinephrine (no effect on bradykinin pathway)
- Antihistamines (histamine is not the mediator)
- Corticosteroids (no effect on bradykinin pathway; no role in acute attacks)

## Disposition

- **Laryngeal edema:** admit for observation minimum 24 hours after treatment; airway can re-swell
- **Severe facial/tongue swelling:** observe 6-12 hours after treatment
- **Abdominal attack responding to treatment:** observe 4-6 hours; discharge if tolerating PO and pain-free
- **All patients:** ensure they have an emergency action plan, carry on-demand medication (icatibant auto-injector or C1-INH for self-administration), and have allergy/immunology follow-up
- **Prophylaxis referral:** patients with frequent attacks benefit from prophylactic C1-INH (Haegarda), lanadelumab, or berotralstat

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating HAE with epinephrine, antihistamines, and steroids.** This is the most common and most dangerous error. HAE is bradykinin-mediated, not histamine-mediated. Standard anaphylaxis treatment is completely ineffective. If the patient does not respond to typical angioedema treatment, consider HAE and administer targeted therapy.

2. **Operating on an abdominal HAE attack.** Abdominal attacks cause severe pain, vomiting, and free fluid that mimics appendicitis or bowel obstruction. Ultrasound showing diffuse bowel wall edema without a surgical target should raise HAE suspicion. Many HAE patients have undergone unnecessary exploratory laparotomy.

3. **Discharging a patient with laryngeal edema after initial improvement.** Laryngeal angioedema can rebound after treatment wears off. Observe for at least 24 hours. Ensure the patient has on-demand medication before discharge.

4. **Not checking C4 level.** A normal C4 level during an acute attack effectively rules out HAE types I and II. This is the best screening test and should be sent in any patient with recurrent angioedema without urticaria.

5. **Prescribing ACE inhibitors to a patient with HAE.** ACE inhibitors block bradykinin degradation and are absolutely contraindicated. ARBs are a safe alternative for hypertension in HAE patients.
