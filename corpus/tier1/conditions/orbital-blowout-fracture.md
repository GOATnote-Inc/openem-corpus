# Orbital Blowout Fracture

## Recognition

**Mechanism:** Direct blow to orbit (fist, ball, fall) causing hydraulic or buckling fracture of orbital floor (most common) or medial wall (lamina papyracea). Orbital rim remains intact.

**Presentation:**
- Periorbital ecchymosis and edema
- Diplopia (especially on upgaze — inferior rectus entrapment)
- Enophthalmos (sunken globe) — may be masked by acute edema
- Infraorbital nerve hypoesthesia/anesthesia (V2 distribution — cheek, upper lip, upper teeth)
- Restricted extraocular movement (vertical gaze limitation)
- Subcutaneous emphysema (if sinus wall violated)

**Pediatric "trapdoor" fracture:**
- Greenstick fracture with elastic bone snapping back, trapping muscle
- Minimal orbital swelling (deceptive appearance)
- Oculocardiac reflex: nausea, vomiting, bradycardia from vagal stimulation of entrapped muscle
- **Surgical emergency** — requires repair within 24-48 hours to prevent muscle ischemia and permanent diplopia

**Globe injury assessment (mandatory):**
- Visual acuity (each eye separately)
- Pupillary response (RAPD = afferent pupillary defect suggests optic nerve injury)
- Intraocular pressure
- Slit lamp exam (hyphema, lens dislocation)
- Fundoscopy (retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Visual acuity assessment | Immediate |
| CT orbits | < 2 hours |
| Ophthalmology consult | < 2 hours (emergent if globe injury or retrobulbar hematoma) |
| Lateral canthotomy | < 30 minutes if orbital compartment syndrome |

1. **Assess for orbital compartment syndrome** — proptosis, rock-hard globe, decreased vision, elevated IOP (> 40 mmHg), cherry-red conjunctiva. If present: **emergent lateral canthotomy and cantholysis** (do not wait for ophthalmology — permanent vision loss within 90-120 minutes)
2. **Rule out globe rupture** — teardrop pupil, positive Seidel test (fluorescein streaming), extrusion of intraocular contents. If suspected: shield eye (no pressure), avoid IOP measurement, emergent ophthalmology
3. **CT orbits** with thin-cut coronal and sagittal reformats — identifies fracture location, size, herniated tissue, muscle entrapment
4. **Instruct patient:** NO nose blowing (Valsalva forces air through fracture into orbit causing orbital emphysema/compartment syndrome)
5. **Ice packs** to reduce edema; keep HOB elevated 30 degrees

## Differential Diagnosis

- Zygomatic (tripod/tetrapod) fracture — involves orbital rim, zygomatic arch, lateral orbital wall; palpable step-off at inferior orbital rim
- Le Fort II/III fracture — midface mobility, more extensive injury
- Globe rupture — irregular pupil, decreased IOP, positive Seidel test
- Retrobulbar hemorrhage without fracture
- Orbital cellulitis (no trauma history, fever, erythema)
- Superior orbital fissure syndrome — CN III, IV, V1, VI palsies from fracture extending to fissure
- Orbital apex syndrome — same as above plus vision loss (optic nerve involvement)

## Workup

- **CT orbits** thin-cut (1 mm) with coronal and sagittal reconstructions — gold standard
- **CT face** if concern for associated facial fractures
- **Visual acuity** — Snellen chart or handheld card (document bilaterally)
- **Extraocular movement testing** — forced duction test if entrapment suspected (typically done by ophthalmology in OR)
- **Intraocular pressure** — tonometry (unless globe rupture suspected)
- **Slit lamp examination** — hyphema, lens subluxation, corneal abrasion
- **No MRI acutely** — metallic foreign body must be excluded first; CT is imaging of choice

## Treatment

**Acute management:**
- Ice packs 20 minutes on/off for 48 hours
- HOB elevation 30 degrees
- Strict nose-blowing precautions
- Antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID x 7 days (sinus fracture with orbital communication) or clindamycin 300 mg PO TID if penicillin-allergic
- Nasal decongestant: oxymetazoline 0.05% spray 2 sprays each nostril BID x 3 days (promote sinus drainage)
- Analgesics: acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h + ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h alternating

**Surgical indications (OMFS/ophthalmology):**
- Muscle entrapment with restricted gaze (especially pediatric trapdoor — within 24-48h)
- Enophthalmos > 2 mm
- Large floor defect > 50% of orbital floor on CT
- Diplopia persisting beyond 2 weeks despite edema resolution
- Pediatric trapdoor fracture with oculocardiac reflex — emergent

**Orbital compartment syndrome:**
- Lateral canthotomy and inferior cantholysis — EMERGENCY, do at bedside
- Inject 1-2 mL lidocaine 1% with epinephrine at lateral canthus
- Crush lateral canthus with hemostat for hemostasis
- Cut lateral canthal tendon with scissors
- Strum inferior canthal tendon (inferior crus of lateral canthal tendon) and cut until lower lid falls away from globe
- Reassess IOP — should decrease rapidly

## Disposition

- **Discharge:** Most isolated blowout fractures without globe injury, entrapment, or compartment syndrome
- **Follow-up:** Ophthalmology and OMFS/plastics within 5-7 days for reassessment
- **Admit:** Globe injury, orbital compartment syndrome, pediatric trapdoor fracture, associated significant facial fractures
- **Emergent OR:** Pediatric trapdoor with muscle entrapment and oculocardiac reflex; orbital compartment syndrome not responding to canthotomy
- **Return precautions:** Worsening vision, increasing pain, new diplopia, eye protrusion, fever

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing pediatric trapdoor fracture because of minimal swelling.** Children have elastic bone that snaps back after fracturing, trapping muscle with minimal visible deformity. Vomiting and bradycardia (oculocardiac reflex) in a child after orbital trauma is an entrapment emergency.

2. **Telling the patient to blow their nose.** Nose-blowing forces air from the fractured sinus into the orbit, causing orbital emphysema and potentially orbital compartment syndrome. This is the single most important patient instruction.

3. **Failing to check visual acuity before periorbital swelling makes exam impossible.** Visual acuity must be documented at initial presentation. Once swelling prevents exam, baseline is lost and retrobulbar hemorrhage may go undetected.

4. **Not performing lateral canthotomy for orbital compartment syndrome because "ophthalmology is on the way."** Vision loss from orbital compartment syndrome is irreversible after 90-120 minutes. This is an emergency physician procedure — do not wait for consultants.

5. **Attributing all diplopia to edema and deferring follow-up.** While edema-related diplopia resolves, true muscle entrapment requires surgical repair. Ensure ophthalmology/OMFS follow-up within 1-2 weeks.
