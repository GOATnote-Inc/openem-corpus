# Catatonic Emergency (Malignant Catatonia)

## Recognition

**Catatonia = a psychomotor syndrome, NOT a diagnosis.** Occurs in medical AND psychiatric conditions.

**Key signs (Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale — 14 items; >= 2 items = positive screen):**
- **Immobility/stupor:** minimal response to stimuli, motionless
- **Mutism:** no or minimal verbal response
- **Staring:** fixed gaze, decreased blinking
- **Posturing:** spontaneous maintenance of unusual positions
- **Waxy flexibility (catalepsy):** examiner-induced posture is maintained
- **Negativism:** opposition to passive movement or instructions
- **Rigidity:** maintained against passive movement
- **Stereotypy:** repetitive purposeless movements
- **Echolalia/echopraxia:** repeating examiner's words/movements
- **Excitement:** purposeless, excessive motor activity
- **Grimacing**
- **Verbigeration:** repetitive meaningless speech

**Malignant catatonia (EMERGENCY — overlaps with NMS):**
- Catatonic signs PLUS:
- Fever (> 38C)
- Autonomic instability (tachycardia, labile BP, diaphoresis)
- Rigidity (lead-pipe)
- Altered consciousness
- Rhabdomyolysis (elevated CK)
- Mortality 20-30% without treatment

**Etiologies (medical workup is MANDATORY):**
- Psychiatric: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder (mania), severe depression, autism spectrum disorder
- Medical: encephalitis (anti-NMDA receptor), seizures (non-convulsive status), metabolic (hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, hyponatremia), SLE cerebritis, thyroid storm, paraneoplastic
- Drug-related: antipsychotic withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, phencyclidine, alcohol withdrawal

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Recognize catatonia (Bush-Francis screening) | At presentation |
| Rule out medical causes | Immediate |
| Lorazepam challenge | < 1 hour |
| STOP antipsychotics if on them | Immediately (may cause or worsen catatonia) |
| If malignant features: resuscitate | Immediately |

1. **Screen with Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale** — >= 2 signs = positive
2. **STOP all antipsychotics** — antipsychotics worsen catatonia and can precipitate malignant catatonia
3. **Lorazepam challenge:** lorazepam 1-2 mg IV — assess response at 5-10 minutes; partial or complete resolution is diagnostic and therapeutic
4. **Medical workup** — catatonia has a medical cause in up to 20% of cases
5. **If malignant features (fever, rigidity, autonomic instability):** aggressive resuscitation, cooling, IV fluids, CK, monitor for rhabdomyolysis

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Neuroleptic malignant syndrome** (recent antipsychotic initiation/increase; clinically overlaps with malignant catatonia — may be same spectrum; responds to same treatment)
- Non-convulsive status epilepticus (continuous EEG differentiates)
- Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (psychiatric symptoms → seizures → autonomic instability → catatonia; CSF antibodies diagnostic)
- Serotonin syndrome (clonus, hyperreflexia — absent in catatonia; serotonergic drug exposure)
- Locked-in syndrome (awake, aware, only vertical eye movements preserved; pontine lesion)
- Akinetic mutism (bilateral frontal or cingulate lesion — no resistance to movement)
- Severe depression with psychomotor retardation (slow, not immobile; may respond to lorazepam)
- Encephalitis (fever, altered sensorium, CSF pleocytosis)
- Hepatic encephalopathy (asterixis, elevated ammonia)

## Workup

- **Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale** — bedside screening tool
- **Lorazepam challenge** — both diagnostic and therapeutic
- **CBC with differential:** leukocytosis (infection, NMS)
- **BMP:** electrolytes, glucose, BUN/creatinine, calcium
- **CK (creatine kinase):** rhabdomyolysis (markedly elevated in malignant catatonia)
- **Liver function tests:** hepatic encephalopathy
- **TSH:** thyroid storm, myxedema
- **Ammonia:** hepatic encephalopathy
- **Urinalysis with myoglobin:** myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis)
- **Blood/urine toxicology:** PCP, sympathomimetics, alcohol level
- **CT head:** exclude structural lesion
- **Lumbar puncture:** if encephalitis suspected (anti-NMDA receptor, infectious) — CSF cell count, protein, glucose, HSV PCR, NMDA receptor antibodies
- **EEG:** non-convulsive status epilepticus (should be obtained in all patients with catatonia not responding to lorazepam)
- **MRI brain:** anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (may be normal), SLE cerebritis, encephalitis

## Treatment

### Lorazepam (First-Line)
- **Lorazepam 1-2 mg IV** — observe response at 5-10 minutes
- Positive response (improvement in mutism, rigidity, or posturing) = diagnostic of catatonia
- **Titrate to effect:** lorazepam 2 mg IV q4-6h; may need 6-20 mg/day total
- Continue scheduled lorazepam until underlying condition treated
- **Do NOT use low-dose intermittent benzodiazepines** — scheduled dosing is essential
- **If no response to lorazepam 6-8 mg over 24 hours:** consider ECT

### Malignant Catatonia / NMS Overlap
- **STOP all antipsychotics immediately**
- **Lorazepam 2 mg IV q4-6h** — mainstay
- **Bromocriptine 2.5 mg PO/NG q8h** — dopamine agonist (titrate to 30 mg/day if needed)
- **Dantrolene 1-2.5 mg/kg IV** (max 10 mg/kg/day) — muscle relaxant for rigidity and hyperthermia
- **Aggressive IV hydration:** NS at 200-500 mL/hr initially (rhabdomyolysis prevention)
- **Active cooling** if temperature > 39C (ice packs, cooling blankets, cold IV fluids)
- **Continuous cardiac monitoring** — dysrhythmia risk from autonomic instability
- **Foley catheter** — monitor urine output (target > 200 mL/hr for myoglobinuria)

### Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)
- **Gold standard for catatonia refractory to benzodiazepines**
- Effective in > 80% of cases
- Bilateral electrode placement, daily treatments until resolution (typically 6-10 sessions)
- Indicated emergently for malignant catatonia not responding to medical management within 48 hours

### Medical Catatonia
- Treat the underlying cause (anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis: IVIG, plasmapheresis, rituximab; infection: appropriate antibiotics; metabolic: correct the derangement)
- Lorazepam as bridge while definitive treatment takes effect

## Disposition

- **Malignant catatonia (fever, autonomic instability, rhabdomyolysis):** ICU admission; continuous monitoring; neurology and psychiatry co-management
- **Non-malignant catatonia responding to lorazepam:** psychiatric unit admission with scheduled lorazepam; medical clearance
- **Non-malignant catatonia NOT responding to lorazepam:** admission for EEG (non-convulsive status), further medical workup (anti-NMDA antibodies, MRI), and possible ECT
- **All patients:** medication reconciliation — ensure antipsychotics are held or discontinued

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating catatonia with antipsychotics.** Antipsychotics WORSEN catatonia and can precipitate malignant catatonia. The treatment is benzodiazepines (lorazepam), not antipsychotics. This is the most dangerous error in catatonia management.

2. **Misdiagnosing catatonia as "unresponsive" or "malingering."** Catatonic patients appear awake with open eyes, fixed staring, and resistance to passive movement. They are NOT unconscious. Check for waxy flexibility and perform the Bush-Francis screening.

3. **Not performing a medical workup.** Catatonia is a syndrome, not a diagnosis. Up to 20% have a medical etiology (encephalitis, metabolic, structural). CT head, basic labs, and consideration of LP and EEG are mandatory before attributing catatonia to a psychiatric cause.

4. **Failing to distinguish malignant catatonia from NMS.** These conditions overlap significantly and may represent the same spectrum. The treatment is nearly identical: stop antipsychotics, give lorazepam, supportive care. Do not waste time debating the distinction — treat both aggressively.

5. **Using only as-needed lorazepam instead of scheduled dosing.** Catatonia requires sustained GABAergic tone. PRN dosing allows breakthrough symptoms. Schedule lorazepam q4-6h and titrate to clinical response.

6. **Not obtaining EEG for lorazepam-refractory catatonia.** Non-convulsive status epilepticus can mimic catatonia perfectly. An EEG should be obtained in any patient not improving with lorazepam within 24 hours.
