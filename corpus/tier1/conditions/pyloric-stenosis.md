# Pyloric Stenosis

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acquired hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric muscle causing progressive gastric outlet obstruction in infants. The pyloric canal elongates and the circular muscle layer thickens, preventing gastric emptying.

**Epidemiology:**
- Incidence: 2-4 per 1,000 live births
- Peak presentation: 3-6 weeks of age (range 2-12 weeks)
- Male:female ratio 4-5:1
- Firstborn males at highest risk
- More common in White infants (2.4/1,000) vs Hispanic (1.8/1,000), Black (0.7/1,000), or Asian (0.6/1,000)
- Heritability ~87% in affected families; polygenic inheritance pattern
- Associated environmental risk factors: maternal smoking, macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin) in first 2 weeks of life, formula feeding

**Pathophysiology:**
- Etiology remains unknown; likely multifactorial (genetic susceptibility + environmental triggers)
- Progressive hypertrophy of pyloric circular smooth muscle narrows and elongates the pyloric channel
- Gastric outlet obstruction causes forceful non-bilious vomiting (pylorus is proximal to ampulla of Vater)
- Loss of HCl in vomitus drives the classic metabolic derangement: hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis
- Kidneys compensate by retaining H+ and excreting K+ and Na+ (paradoxical aciduria)
- Dehydration progresses from mild to severe over days if untreated

**Presentation:**
- Projectile, non-bilious vomiting after feeds — forceful, may travel several feet
- Vomiting is progressive, initially intermittent then occurring with every feed
- Infant is hungry immediately after vomiting ("hungry vomiter")
- Poor weight gain or weight loss
- Decreased wet diapers, dry mucous membranes, sunken fontanelle
- Visible gastric peristaltic waves (left to right across epigastrium) after feeding
- Palpable pyloric "olive" in RUQ/epigastrium (present in 60-80% on experienced exam; less frequent when diagnosed earlier by ultrasound)
- Jaundice in 2-5% (unconjugated; attributed to hepatic glucuronyl transferase inhibition and caloric deprivation)

**Classic Metabolic Derangement:**
- Hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis
- Serum chloride often < 100 mEq/L (severe cases < 85 mEq/L)
- Serum bicarbonate elevated (> 26 mEq/L)
- Serum potassium low (< 3.5 mEq/L)
- Paradoxical aciduria: kidneys excrete H+ to retain Na+ and K+ despite systemic alkalosis

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess hydration status immediately.** Evaluate fontanelle, mucous membranes, skin turgor, capillary refill, urine output, and weight compared to birth weight. Dehydration is the acute ED threat, not the obstruction itself.
2. **IV access and fluid resuscitation.** Start NS 20 mL/kg bolus. Repeat as needed for signs of moderate-severe dehydration. Then switch to D5 NS + 20 mEq/L KCl at 1.5x maintenance rate once urine output is confirmed.
3. **Obtain electrolytes (BMP) and venous blood gas.** Quantify the degree of hypochloremic hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. This determines the duration of fluid resuscitation needed before surgery.
4. **Make the infant NPO.** Ongoing feeds worsen vomiting and aspiration risk.
5. **Obtain pyloric ultrasound.** Diagnostic study of choice. Pyloric muscle thickness > 3 mm and pyloric channel length > 15 mm are diagnostic.
6. **Consult pediatric surgery.** Pyloromyotomy is definitive treatment but is NOT emergent. Surgery proceeds only after electrolytes and hydration are corrected.
7. **Do NOT rush to the OR.** Operating on a dehydrated, alkalotic infant increases anesthetic risk (post-operative apnea from uncorrected alkalosis). Electrolyte correction takes 12-48 hours.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| GERD / overfeeding | Non-projectile, effortless emesis; weight gain normal; no metabolic derangement; no pyloric thickening on US |
| Malrotation with midgut volvulus | BILIOUS (green) vomiting = surgical emergency; upper GI series shows malposition of ligament of Treitz; any bilious vomiting in a neonate demands emergent evaluation |
| Pyloric spasm / pylorospasm | Intermittent non-bilious vomiting; normal ultrasound; self-resolving; no progressive dehydration |
| Formula intolerance / milk protein allergy | Vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stools, eczema; resolves with formula change; normal US |
| Gastroenteritis | Diarrhea prominent; often febrile; sick contacts; usually older infant |
| Adrenal crisis (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) | Ambiguous genitalia (46,XX), hyponatremia, hyperkalemia (opposite electrolyte pattern); hypotension, hypoglycemia |
| Increased intracranial pressure | Bulging fontanelle, altered mental status, abnormal exam; vomiting may be projectile but no metabolic alkalosis |
| Inborn error of metabolism | Lethargy, poor feeding, seizures; metabolic acidosis (not alkalosis); ammonia and organic acids elevated |
| Duodenal atresia / stenosis | Bilious vomiting in first days of life; "double bubble" on X-ray; associated with trisomy 21 |

## Workup

**Laboratory:**
- **BMP:** Na, K, Cl, CO2, BUN, Cr, glucose — quantify dehydration and electrolyte derangement
- **Venous blood gas:** confirm metabolic alkalosis (pH > 7.45, pCO2 elevated as respiratory compensation, HCO3 elevated)
- **Urinalysis:** concentrated urine, paradoxical aciduria in severe cases
- **CBC:** usually normal; hemoconcentration if severely dehydrated
- **Total and direct bilirubin:** if jaundiced (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in 2-5%)

**Imaging:**
- **Abdominal ultrasound (diagnostic study of choice):**
  - Pyloric muscle thickness > 3 mm (single wall measurement)
  - Pyloric channel length > 15 mm
  - Pyloric diameter > 11 mm (transverse)
  - Failure of pyloric channel to open during real-time observation
  - Sensitivity 97-100%, specificity 99-100%
  - Best performed with infant in right lateral decubitus position after a period of NPO
  - Feed a small amount of glucose water (Pedialyte) immediately before US if pylorus not visualized — distends the stomach and highlights the pyloric anatomy

- **Upper GI series (if US equivocal or unavailable):**
  - "String sign" — narrow, elongated pyloric channel
  - "Shoulder sign" — impression of hypertrophied muscle on gastric antrum
  - "Double track sign" — barium in compressed mucosal folds
  - Not first-line due to radiation exposure and aspiration risk from barium

- **Abdominal X-ray:** NOT diagnostic. May show distended stomach with paucity of distal gas. Primary utility is excluding other diagnoses (free air, double bubble of duodenal atresia).

## Treatment

**Fluid and Electrolyte Correction (the ED priority):**

Dehydration severity guides resuscitation intensity:

- **Mild dehydration (< 5% weight loss):**
  - NS 20 mL/kg bolus, then D5 NS at 1.5x maintenance IV
  - Electrolytes usually correct within 12-24 hours

- **Moderate dehydration (5-10% weight loss):**
  - NS 20 mL/kg bolus, may repeat x1-2
  - Then D5 NS + 20 mEq/L KCl at 1.5x maintenance (once voiding)
  - Target correction: Cl > 100 mEq/L, K > 3.5 mEq/L, HCO3 < 26 mEq/L
  - Typically requires 24-36 hours of resuscitation

- **Severe dehydration (> 10% weight loss, hemodynamic compromise):**
  - NS 20 mL/kg bolus, repeat until perfusion restored (may need 40-60 mL/kg)
  - D5 NS + 20-40 mEq/L KCl at 1.5-2x maintenance after initial resuscitation
  - Close monitoring of electrolytes q6-8h
  - May require 36-48 hours to correct alkalosis

**Maintenance fluid rates (Holliday-Segar):**
- 0-10 kg: 100 mL/kg/day (4 mL/kg/hr)
- Typical 4 kg neonate: maintenance = 16 mL/hr; 1.5x maintenance = 24 mL/hr

**Key Principles:**
- Normal saline (0.9% NaCl) is the resuscitation fluid of choice — provides chloride to correct hypochloremia
- Do NOT add potassium until urine output is confirmed (at least 1 mL/kg/hr)
- Monitor glucose — neonates are at risk for hypoglycemia (D5-containing fluids once past initial bolus)
- Do NOT use lactated Ringer (contains less chloride, does not correct hypochloremia as effectively)
- Surgery readiness criteria: serum Cl > 100 mEq/L, K > 3.5 mEq/L, HCO3 < 26 mEq/L, adequate urine output

**Surgical Treatment (Ramstedt Pyloromyotomy):**
- Definitive treatment: longitudinal incision through serosa and hypertrophied muscle down to (but not through) the mucosa
- Open (right upper quadrant transverse or periumbilical incision) or laparoscopic approach
- Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy associated with shorter operative time, fewer wound complications, and shorter length of stay
- Success rate > 99%; recurrence rare
- Feeds typically started 4-6 hours post-operatively and advanced as tolerated
- Some vomiting in first 24-48 hours post-op is normal (edema at pyloromyotomy site)

**NOT an Emergency Operation:** Pyloromyotomy is an urgent but not emergent procedure. A dehydrated, alkalotic infant has significantly higher anesthetic risk (post-operative apnea from residual metabolic alkalosis affecting respiratory drive). Electrolyte correction BEFORE surgery is mandatory.

## Disposition

**Admission (all patients):**
- All infants with pyloric stenosis require admission for IV fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction, and pyloromyotomy
- Admit to pediatric surgery service
- Typical hospital stay: 1-3 days (24-48h pre-op resuscitation + 1 day post-op)

**Post-Operative:**
- Feeds initiated 4-6 hours after surgery and advanced per protocol (ad lib feeding is increasingly practiced and may shorten stay)
- Discharge when tolerating full feeds without significant vomiting (small emesis episodes in first 24-48 hours post-op are expected)
- Follow-up with pediatric surgery in 1-2 weeks

**ED Transfer Considerations:**
- If diagnosed at a facility without pediatric surgery, stabilize with IV fluids and NPO status, then arrange transfer
- This is NOT a time-critical transfer — stabilize fluid status first
- Provide clear handoff of electrolyte values and volume of fluid administered

**Return Precautions (post-discharge):**
- Persistent vomiting > 48 hours post-op (incomplete myotomy or mucosal injury)
- Fever, wound erythema, drainage (surgical site infection)
- Bilious (green) vomiting at any time
- Poor feeding, lethargy, decreased wet diapers

## Pitfalls

1. **Confusing non-bilious and bilious vomiting.** Pyloric stenosis produces non-bilious vomiting because the obstruction is proximal to the ampulla of Vater. Bilious (green) vomiting in a neonate is malrotation with midgut volvulus until proven otherwise and requires emergent upper GI series and surgical consultation. Misattributing bilious vomiting to pyloric stenosis delays recognition of a life-threatening surgical emergency.

2. **Rushing to the operating room before correcting electrolytes.** Pyloromyotomy under general anesthesia in a dehydrated, alkalotic infant risks post-operative apnea. Metabolic alkalosis shifts the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve left (impaired oxygen delivery) and depresses central respiratory drive. Surgery waits until Cl > 100, K > 3.5, HCO3 < 26 — this may take 24-48 hours and that is acceptable.

3. **Using a normal abdominal X-ray to exclude pyloric stenosis.** Plain radiographs are not diagnostic. A distended stomach with distal paucity of gas is suggestive but insensitive. Ultrasound is the diagnostic standard. Ordering an X-ray instead of an ultrasound delays diagnosis.

4. **Missing the diagnosis in female infants or non-firstborn children.** While firstborn males are at highest risk (4-5:1 male predominance), pyloric stenosis occurs in females and non-firstborn children. Anchoring on demographics and dismissing the presentation in a female infant leads to delayed diagnosis and worsening dehydration.

5. **Attributing progressive vomiting to GERD or overfeeding.** Pyloric stenosis mimics GERD in early stages. The distinguishing features are: vomiting becomes progressively more forceful (projectile), the infant is hungry immediately after vomiting, weight gain plateaus or reverses, and metabolic alkalosis develops. GERD does not cause metabolic alkalosis. If an infant with "reflux" is losing weight or has electrolyte derangement, obtain a pyloric ultrasound.

6. **Using lactated Ringer for resuscitation.** LR contains only 109 mEq/L of chloride vs 154 mEq/L in NS. The primary electrolyte deficit in pyloric stenosis is chloride. Normal saline corrects hypochloremia more effectively. LR also contains lactate, which is metabolized to bicarbonate, potentially worsening the existing alkalosis.

7. **Adding potassium to IV fluids before confirming urine output.** Hypokalemia is common and must be corrected, but potassium supplementation in a dehydrated infant who is not yet voiding risks hyperkalemia. Confirm at least 1 mL/kg/hr urine output before adding KCl to maintenance fluids.

8. **Failing to check glucose.** Neonates have limited glycogen stores. Prolonged vomiting with poor oral intake places them at risk for hypoglycemia. Check point-of-care glucose on arrival. Once past initial NS bolus resuscitation, use dextrose-containing fluids (D5 NS) for maintenance.

9. **Diagnosing pyloric stenosis in the first week of life.** Pyloric stenosis almost never presents before 2 weeks of age. Vomiting in the first week of life is more likely due to malrotation, duodenal atresia, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, or inborn errors of metabolism. A "pyloric stenosis" diagnosis in a 3-day-old should prompt reconsideration and broader workup.
