# Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

## Recognition

### Classification

| Type | Frequency | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Arterial embolism (SMA) | 40-50% | Cardiac embolus (atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, recent MI, ventricular thrombus) |
| Arterial thrombosis (SMA) | 20-30% | Atherosclerotic stenosis with acute thrombosis; history of chronic mesenteric ischemia (postprandial pain, food fear, weight loss) |
| Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) | 5-15% | Hypercoagulable state, portal hypertension, intra-abdominal inflammation, malignancy |
| Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) | 5-15% | Low-flow state (cardiogenic shock, vasopressors, dialysis, cardiac surgery) |

### Key Clinical Features

- **Pain out of proportion to physical exam** — hallmark finding; severe periumbilical or diffuse abdominal pain with minimal tenderness early
- Rapid onset (minutes to hours) with arterial embolism; more insidious with MVT (days)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (often bloody in late stage)
- History of atrial fibrillation, recent cardiac catheterization, hypercoagulability, or atherosclerotic disease
- Peritoneal signs indicate bowel necrosis — this is a late and ominous finding
- Abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds in advanced disease

### High-Risk Populations
- Atrial fibrillation (especially without anticoagulation)
- Recent MI or cardiac surgery
- Peripheral vascular disease / known aortic atherosclerosis
- Hypercoagulable states (Factor V Leiden, malignancy, antiphospholipid syndrome)
- Chronic mesenteric ischemia (postprandial pain, weight loss) — at risk for acute thrombosis
- Heart failure patients on vasopressors or inotropes (NOMI)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| CT angiography of abdomen/pelvis | Immediately upon clinical suspicion |
| IV fluid resuscitation | Aggressive crystalloid to restore mesenteric perfusion |
| Broad-spectrum antibiotics | If bowel necrosis or perforation suspected |
| Anticoagulation (heparin) | Start unless active hemorrhage |
| Surgical/IR consultation | Emergent — do not delay for labs |
| Correct underlying cause | Rate control for AFib, optimize cardiac output |

1. Obtain CT angiography (arterial and venous phase) immediately when mesenteric ischemia is suspected
2. Establish large-bore IV access, initiate aggressive crystalloid resuscitation
3. Start heparin anticoagulation: bolus 80 units/kg IV, then infusion 18 units/kg/hr (hold if active hemorrhage or planned immediate surgery)
4. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics if bowel necrosis suspected: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV or meropenem 1 g IV
5. Consult vascular surgery and interventional radiology emergently
6. Serial abdominal exams and lactate monitoring
7. Place nasogastric tube for decompression if ileus or distension present

## Differential Diagnosis

- Acute pancreatitis (epigastric pain, elevated lipase, imaging findings)
- Perforated viscus (free air on imaging, peritoneal signs)
- Small bowel obstruction (distension, vomiting, transition point on CT)
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture (pulsatile mass, hemodynamic instability)
- Acute cholecystitis (RUQ pain, Murphy sign, gallbladder wall thickening)
- Renal colic (flank pain, hematuria, hydronephrosis)
- Ischemic colitis (left-sided cramping, bloody diarrhea — typically less severe, involves colon)
- Acute myocardial infarction (inferior MI can present as epigastric pain)
- Volvulus (sigmoid or cecal — closed-loop obstruction on imaging)

## Workup

- **CT angiography (CTA) abdomen/pelvis with arterial and venous phases:** Gold standard. Sensitivity > 95% for arterial occlusion. Findings: SMA filling defect, bowel wall thickening, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, mesenteric fat stranding, free fluid
- **Serum lactate:** Elevated lactate is a late finding indicating bowel necrosis — normal lactate does NOT exclude mesenteric ischemia. Sensitivity only 50-60% for early disease
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis (often marked: WBC > 20,000); hemoconcentration
- **BMP:** Metabolic acidosis with elevated anion gap; AKI from hypovolemia
- **D-dimer:** Elevated in arterial embolism and MVT; non-specific but has high negative predictive value in some studies
- **Coagulation studies:** Baseline PT/INR, aPTT before heparin; DIC screen if advanced disease
- **Lipase:** To exclude pancreatitis
- **LDH, CK, phosphate:** May be elevated with bowel infarction but lack specificity; do not rely on these to diagnose or exclude
- **Type and screen:** Anticipate possible surgical intervention
- **ECG:** Identify atrial fibrillation or acute MI as embolic source
- **Plain abdominal radiograph:** Low sensitivity; may show ileus, thumbprinting, pneumatosis, or portal venous gas in late disease. A normal X-ray does NOT exclude mesenteric ischemia.

## Treatment

### Resuscitation
- Aggressive IV crystalloid (lactated Ringer's preferred), titrate to MAP >= 65 mmHg
- Avoid vasopressors if possible — they worsen mesenteric vasoconstriction. Use only if refractory hypotension after adequate volume resuscitation
- Correct electrolytes and acidosis
- NPO, place nasogastric tube for decompression

### Anticoagulation
- **Unfractionated heparin:** Bolus 80 units/kg IV, then 18 units/kg/hr infusion. Titrate to aPTT 1.5-2.5x normal
- Indicated for all types (arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, MVT) unless contraindicated by active hemorrhage or imminent surgery
- Prevents clot propagation while awaiting definitive management

### Antibiotics
- Initiate if any concern for bowel necrosis, perforation, or peritonitis
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h** OR **meropenem 1 g IV q8h**
- Alternative: ceftriaxone 2 g IV + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
- Cover gram-negatives and anaerobes (translocation from ischemic bowel)

### Definitive Management

**Arterial embolism (SMA):**
- Surgical embolectomy (open or laparoscopic) — standard of care for peritonitis
- Catheter-directed thrombolysis or aspiration thrombectomy via IR if no peritoneal signs
- Second-look laparotomy at 24-48 hours to assess bowel viability

**Arterial thrombosis:**
- Endovascular stenting of SMA (IR) if no peritoneal signs
- Surgical bypass or endarterectomy for failed endovascular or peritonitis

**Mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT):**
- Systemic anticoagulation is primary treatment
- Catheter-directed thrombolysis for extensive clot burden with worsening despite heparin
- Surgery reserved for peritoneal signs indicating bowel necrosis
- Long-term anticoagulation required; hypercoagulability workup

**Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI):**
- Optimize cardiac output, wean vasopressors
- Intra-arterial papaverine (30-60 mg/hr via SMA catheter) through IR
- Surgical intervention only for frank bowel necrosis

### Bowel Necrosis
- Requires emergent surgical exploration and resection of non-viable bowel
- Damage-control surgery with temporary abdominal closure if hemodynamically unstable
- Plan second-look laparotomy at 24-48 hours before reanastomosis

## Disposition

- **All confirmed acute mesenteric ischemia:** ICU admission
- **Peritoneal signs or hemodynamic instability:** Emergent OR
- **Arterial occlusion without peritonitis:** ICU with emergent IR or surgical consultation for revascularization
- **MVT without bowel necrosis:** ICU or monitored bed for anticoagulation and serial exams
- **High clinical suspicion with negative CTA:** Admit for observation, serial abdominal exams, repeat imaging in 12-24 hours if symptoms persist
- Do not discharge a patient with unexplained severe abdominal pain and risk factors for mesenteric ischemia

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for lactate elevation to diagnose mesenteric ischemia.** Lactate is a late marker of bowel necrosis. By the time lactate is elevated, bowel may be unsalvageable. A normal lactate does NOT exclude the diagnosis.

2. **Relying on plain abdominal radiographs.** Plain films are normal in early mesenteric ischemia. Pneumatosis and portal venous gas are late findings of transmural infarction. CTA is the required imaging study.

3. **Dismissing the diagnosis because the abdomen is soft.** Pain out of proportion to exam is the hallmark. A benign abdominal exam in a patient with severe pain and risk factors should heighten suspicion, not reduce it.

4. **Failing to obtain CTA with arterial AND venous phases.** Standard contrast CT may miss early arterial occlusion or mesenteric venous thrombosis. Order CTA with both arterial and venous phases explicitly.

5. **Attributing symptoms to gastroenteritis or constipation in a patient with atrial fibrillation.** Any patient with AFib, recent MI, or known vascular disease presenting with acute abdominal pain requires CTA to exclude mesenteric ischemia.

6. **Delaying surgical consultation to "wait for labs."** Mesenteric ischemia is a surgical emergency. Consult surgery and IR at the time of clinical suspicion, not after confirmatory imaging.

7. **Using vasopressors without adequate volume resuscitation.** Vasopressors worsen mesenteric vasoconstriction and can convert reversible ischemia to infarction. Prioritize crystalloid resuscitation to maintain perfusion.

8. **Forgetting non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) in ICU patients on vasopressors.** NOMI does not show a vessel occlusion on CTA. Maintain suspicion in critically ill patients on vasopressors or inotropes who develop abdominal pain, distension, or feeding intolerance.

9. **Not checking for hypercoagulable state in MVT.** Mesenteric venous thrombosis in a younger patient without obvious risk factors requires hypercoagulability workup (Factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, JAK2 for myeloproliferative disease).

10. **Missing the chronic-to-acute transition.** Patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia (postprandial pain, food fear, weight loss) who present with acute severe pain have likely progressed to acute thrombosis. These patients need emergent intervention despite a "chronic" history.
