# Acute Valvular Emergency

## Recognition

### Acute Aortic Regurgitation (AR)
**Etiologies:** infective endocarditis (most common), aortic dissection, prosthetic valve dehiscence, trauma.

**Presentation:**
- Sudden-onset flash pulmonary edema with dyspnea, tachypnea, hypotension
- Short, soft diastolic decrescendo murmur at left sternal border (may be inaudible due to rapid equalization of aortic and LV diastolic pressures)
- Tachycardia, wide pulse pressure absent (unlike chronic AR — the LV has not dilated to compensate)
- Austin Flint murmur (low-pitched diastolic rumble at apex) may be present
- Signs of endocarditis: fever, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, splinter hemorrhages

**Bedside echo:** Flail aortic leaflet, regurgitant jet on color Doppler, premature mitral valve closure (pathognomonic), dilated aortic root (dissection), vegetations.

### Acute Mitral Regurgitation (MR)
**Etiologies:** papillary muscle rupture post-MI (posteromedial > anterolateral, typically 2-7 days post-MI), chordae tendineae rupture (myxomatous degeneration, endocarditis), prosthetic valve failure.

**Presentation:**
- Sudden flash pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock
- New holosystolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla (may be soft or absent in severe acute MR due to rapid LA pressure equalization)
- Hypotension, tachycardia, bilateral rales
- Abrupt deterioration in post-MI patient

**Bedside echo:** Flail mitral leaflet, ruptured papillary muscle head, eccentric regurgitant jet on color Doppler, hyperdynamic LV (volume not yet dilated).

### Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS) with Decompensation
**Presentation:**
- Syncope or near-syncope + harsh systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at right upper sternal border radiating to carotids
- Triad of symptoms: syncope, angina, heart failure (each marks progressive mortality risk)
- Syncope in critical AS = 50% 1-year mortality without intervention
- Pulsus parvus et tardus (delayed, diminished carotid upstroke)
- S4 gallop, narrow pulse pressure
- Decompensation: flash pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock

**Bedside echo:** Calcified aortic valve with restricted opening, aortic valve area < 1.0 cm2, peak velocity > 4 m/s, mean gradient > 40 mmHg.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Bedside echocardiography | < 10 minutes from presentation |
| Cardiothoracic surgery consultation | Immediate at time of diagnosis |
| Hemodynamic stabilization | Concurrent with workup |

1. **Bedside echocardiography immediately** to identify valve pathology, severity, and mechanism
2. **Acute AR/MR:** Afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside 0.3-5 mcg/kg/min IV titrated to MAP 60-70 mmHg — reduces regurgitant fraction and improves forward cardiac output
3. **Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) for acute MR only** — augments diastolic coronary perfusion and reduces afterload. **IABP is absolutely contraindicated in acute AR** (diastolic balloon inflation worsens aortic regurgitation and causes hemodynamic collapse)
4. **Critical AS: Do NOT give vasodilators, nitrates, or diuretics** — preload-dependent, fixed obstruction; vasodilation causes irreversible cardiovascular collapse
5. **Critical AS with hypotension:** Phenylephrine 100-200 mcg IV bolus to maintain coronary perfusion pressure; cautious volume resuscitation with NS 250 mL boluses
6. **Emergent cardiothoracic surgery consultation** for all acute severe valvular emergencies — definitive treatment is surgical valve repair or replacement
7. **Blood cultures x2** before antibiotics if endocarditis suspected, then empiric antibiotics (vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Acute decompensated heart failure (chronic valvular disease, dilated cardiomyopathy — echo differentiates)
- STEMI (papillary muscle rupture occurs days post-MI; obtain ECG)
- Aortic dissection with AR (check for pulse deficits, mediastinal widening, tearing pain)
- Pulmonary embolism (RV dilation, no valvular pathology on echo)
- Cardiac tamponade (pericardial effusion, diastolic collapse on echo)
- Septic shock (may coexist with endocarditis-related valve destruction)
- Tension pneumothorax (absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation)

## Workup

- **Point-of-care echocardiography:** First-line; assess valve morphology, regurgitant severity, LV function, pericardial effusion, aortic root dimensions
- **ECG:** LV hypertrophy (AS), ST changes (ischemia from papillary muscle rupture or reduced coronary perfusion), new conduction abnormalities (aortic root abscess in endocarditis)
- **Chest X-ray:** Pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly (chronic), widened mediastinum (dissection)
- **Troponin:** Elevated in papillary muscle rupture, demand ischemia
- **BNP/NT-proBNP:** Markedly elevated in acute decompensation
- **CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, type and crossmatch**
- **Blood cultures x2** from separate sites if endocarditis suspected
- **Lactate** to assess perfusion
- **CT aorta with contrast** if dissection suspected (stable patient only)
- **TEE** (transesophageal echo) for definitive valve assessment — arrange urgently but do not delay treatment

## Treatment

### Acute Aortic Regurgitation
- Sodium nitroprusside 0.3-5 mcg/kg/min IV to reduce afterload and regurgitant volume
- Dobutamine 2-20 mcg/kg/min IV for inotropic support if cardiogenic shock
- **Do NOT use IABP** — diastolic augmentation worsens aortic regurgitation
- **Do NOT use beta-blockers** — tachycardia is compensatory, reducing heart rate increases diastolic filling time and worsens regurgitant volume
- Emergent surgical aortic valve replacement

### Acute Mitral Regurgitation
- Sodium nitroprusside 0.3-5 mcg/kg/min IV to reduce afterload (favors forward flow over regurgitant flow)
- IABP if refractory to vasodilators (reduces afterload, improves forward output)
- Dobutamine 2-20 mcg/kg/min IV for inotropic support
- Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV if vasodilator-induced hypotension prevents adequate MAP
- Emergent surgical mitral valve repair or replacement

### Critical Aortic Stenosis with Decompensation
- **Phenylephrine 100-200 mcg IV bolus** for acute hypotension (maintain coronary perfusion through fixed stenosis)
- Cautious volume resuscitation: NS 250 mL boluses with reassessment
- Synchronized cardioversion 100-200 J for new atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability (loss of atrial kick is catastrophic in severe AS)
- **Avoid** nitrates, nitroprusside, diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors
- Emergent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical AVR

### Endocarditis-Related Valve Destruction
- Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose (no fixed maximum — dose by weight) + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h (or gentamicin 1 mg/kg IV q8h if native valve requiring synergy)
- Adjust antibiotics to culture results
- Surgical valve replacement for: hemodynamic instability, heart failure from valve destruction, large vegetations (>10 mm), abscess formation, persistent bacteremia > 5-7 days

## Disposition

- **All acute severe valvular emergencies:** ICU admission with continuous hemodynamic monitoring
- **Surgical candidates:** Operating room for emergent valve repair/replacement
- **Cardiogenic shock refractory to medical therapy:** Consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as bridge to surgery
- **Critical AS with syncope (hemodynamically stable):** Monitored bed, urgent cardiology and CT surgery consultation; inpatient valve replacement
- **Transfer** to facility with cardiothoracic surgery and interventional cardiology if not available

## Pitfalls

1. **Mistaking acute AR for chronic AR based on murmur.** The diastolic murmur in acute AR is short and soft (rapid pressure equalization), unlike the classic long decrescendo murmur of chronic AR. A soft murmur does not mean mild disease.

2. **Giving nitrates or vasodilators to a patient with critical aortic stenosis.** Fixed obstruction means cardiac output cannot increase to compensate for afterload reduction. Vasodilation causes profound hypotension, syncope, and cardiac arrest.

3. **Placing an IABP for acute aortic regurgitation.** Diastolic balloon inflation increases aortic diastolic pressure and worsens regurgitant flow back into the LV. IABP is beneficial in acute MR but contraindicated in acute AR.

4. **Failing to diagnose papillary muscle rupture in a post-MI patient with sudden deterioration.** New murmur + pulmonary edema 2-7 days post-MI is papillary muscle rupture until proven otherwise. Immediate bedside echo is diagnostic.

5. **Attributing flash pulmonary edema to "CHF exacerbation" without performing bedside echo.** Acute valvular disruption causes sudden pulmonary edema in patients without prior heart failure history. Echo differentiates within minutes.

6. **Administering beta-blockers for tachycardia in acute AR.** Tachycardia is a critical compensatory mechanism that limits diastolic regurgitant time. Slowing heart rate increases regurgitant volume and precipitates cardiovascular collapse.

7. **Missing endocarditis as the cause of acute valve failure.** Fever + new murmur + acute heart failure = endocarditis until proven otherwise. Obtain blood cultures before antibiotics but do not delay empiric treatment.

8. **Relying on chest X-ray alone to exclude acute valvular emergency.** CXR may be normal early in acute valve failure before pulmonary edema develops. Bedside echo is the definitive ED diagnostic tool.

9. **Failing to obtain emergent surgical consultation.** All acute severe valvular emergencies are surgical diseases. Medical management is temporizing only. Delay in surgical referral increases mortality.
