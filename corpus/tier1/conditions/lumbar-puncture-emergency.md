# Lumbar Puncture (Emergency)

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Suspected bacterial meningitis (fever, headache, neck stiffness, altered mental status — classic triad present in < 50% of adults)
- Rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) when CT head is negative (CT sensitivity ~95% within 6 hours but drops to ~85% at 24 hours; LP required if clinical suspicion remains)
- Suspected viral meningitis/encephalitis (HSV encephalitis requires CSF PCR for diagnosis)
- Suspected fungal meningitis (cryptococcal — CSF CrAg, India ink, opening pressure)
- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) — diagnostic (elevated opening pressure) and therapeutic (CSF drainage)
- Suspected Guillain-Barre syndrome (albuminocytologic dissociation: elevated protein, normal cell count)
- Suspected CNS malignancy (leptomeningeal carcinomatosis — cytology)
- Therapeutic CSF drainage for elevated ICP (e.g., cryptococcal meningitis)

**Contraindications:**
- Signs of elevated ICP with risk of herniation: papilledema, focal neurologic deficits, GCS < 12, posterior fossa mass — obtain CT head FIRST
- Overlying skin infection at LP site
- Severe coagulopathy: INR > 1.5, platelets < 50,000 — correct before LP if possible (but do NOT delay antibiotics for correction)
- Epidural abscess at the LP level (relative — imaging first)

**Critical Rule:** LP should NEVER delay antibiotics in suspected bacterial meningitis. If LP will be delayed (CT needed, coagulopathy to correct, procedural difficulty), give empiric antibiotics FIRST, then LP when feasible. CSF cultures remain positive for hours after antibiotics.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Clinical suspicion for meningitis | Prompt recognition |
| CT head (if indicated) | Before LP only if focal deficits, GCS < 12, papilledema, immunocompromised, seizure, age > 60 |
| Empiric antibiotics (if meningitis suspected) | Within 1 hour of presentation — do NOT delay for LP |
| LP performed | As soon as safe |
| Opening pressure measured | At the beginning of the LP (before fluid removed) |
| CSF sent for analysis | Immediately after collection |

1. **Assess for contraindications** — focal neuro deficits, papilledema, GCS < 12 → CT head first
2. **Start empiric antibiotics** if bacterial meningitis suspected (do not wait for LP)
3. **Position patient** — lateral decubitus (preferred) or seated
4. **Identify landmark** — L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace (iliac crest line = L4 spinous process)
5. **Sterile technique** — prep, drape, anesthetize
6. **Insert spinal needle** — advance until CSF flows
7. **Measure opening pressure** (lateral decubitus position, legs extended)
8. **Collect CSF** in sequential tubes (4 tubes minimum)
9. **Send for analysis** — cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture, and specific tests based on clinical suspicion

## Differential Diagnosis

**When to Perform LP vs. Alternative Investigations:**

| Clinical Scenario | LP Role | Alternative |
|-------------------|---------|------------|
| Suspected bacterial meningitis | Diagnostic (CSF cell count, culture, Gram stain) | Blood cultures + empiric ABx if LP delayed |
| SAH with negative CT | LP for xanthochromia (> 12 hours from onset) or RBCs | CT angiography increasingly used as alternative |
| Suspected HSV encephalitis | CSF PCR (sensitivity 96-98%) | MRI (temporal lobe abnormalities) |
| IIH / pseudotumor cerebri | Diagnostic (OP > 25 cmH2O) and therapeutic | MRI/MRV to exclude venous sinus thrombosis first |
| Guillain-Barre syndrome | Albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein, normal WBC) | Nerve conduction studies; clinical diagnosis |
| TB meningitis | CSF: lymphocytic pleocytosis, low glucose, elevated protein, AFB culture | CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA), nucleic acid amplification |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- Neurologic examination: mental status, focal deficits, papilledema
- CT head indications (IDSA 2004 — obtain CT BEFORE LP if ANY of the following):
  - Immunocompromised state
  - History of CNS disease (mass, stroke, focal infection)
  - New-onset seizure
  - Papilledema
  - Altered level of consciousness (GCS < 12)
  - Focal neurologic deficit
  - Age > 60 (some guidelines)
- Coagulation: INR, platelets (correct if INR > 1.5 or platelets < 50K; in emergencies, proceed with caution)
- Start empiric antibiotics if meningitis suspected

**Equipment:**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| LP kit | Commercially available; includes spinal needle, manometer, collection tubes |
| Spinal needle | 20g or 22g x 3.5 inch (standard adult); 22g x 1.5 inch (pediatric) |
| Atraumatic needle | Sprotte or Whitacre (pencil-point tip) — reduces post-LP headache by 50%; preferred |
| Manometer | For opening pressure measurement |
| 3-way stopcock | Connects needle to manometer |
| Collection tubes | 4 numbered, sterile tubes (1 mL each minimum) |
| Chlorhexidine | Skin prep (preferred over povidone-iodine; wait until dry) |
| Lidocaine | 1% lidocaine 3-5 mL with 25g needle for local anesthesia |
| Sterile drape | Fenestrated drape over the back |
| Ultrasound | Linear probe for identifying midline, interspace, and depth to ligamentum flavum (optional but improves success, especially in obese/difficult anatomy) |

## Treatment

### Patient Positioning

**Lateral Decubitus (Preferred for Opening Pressure Measurement):**
- Patient lying on side, knees drawn to chest (fetal position), neck flexed
- Spine parallel to bed edge; ensure shoulders and hips are stacked vertically (not rotated)
- Have assistant help maintain position
- Opening pressure is measured in this position with legs extended after needle placement

**Seated (Upright):**
- Patient sitting on edge of bed, leaning forward over a bedside table
- Shoulders relaxed, chin to chest, back curved outward
- Advantage: easier landmark identification, especially in obese patients
- Limitation: opening pressure measurement unreliable in seated position (overestimates by 10-20 cmH2O)

### Technique

**Step 1: Identify Landmark**
- Palpate iliac crests bilaterally — a line connecting the iliac crests (Tuffier's line) crosses the spine at L4 or L4-L5 interspace
- Target: L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace (spinal cord ends at L1-L2 in adults; L3 in neonates)
- Ultrasound-assisted: identify midline (spinous processes), interspace, and depth to ligamentum flavum (success rate improves from 62% to 90% with US in difficult anatomy)

**Step 2: Prep and Drape**
- Chlorhexidine scrub in expanding circles over the lumbar spine
- Allow to dry (30 seconds)
- Apply sterile fenestrated drape

**Step 3: Local Anesthesia**
- Lidocaine 1% 3-5 mL using 25g needle
- Raise a skin wheal at the insertion site
- Infiltrate deeper into the interspinous ligament along the anticipated needle track
- Wait 60 seconds for full effect

**Step 4: Insert Spinal Needle**
- Insert 20-22g atraumatic spinal needle (with stylet in place) at the midpoint of the interspace
- Direct the needle slightly cephalad (toward the umbilicus), perpendicular to the skin in the sagittal plane
- Advance slowly — palpable resistance changes:
  - Skin → supraspinous ligament → interspinous ligament → ligamentum flavum (increased resistance) → "pop" as needle penetrates the dura
- After each 2-3 mm advancement, withdraw the stylet to check for CSF flow

**Step 5: CSF Flow**
- Once CSF flows, replace stylet partially if needed to control flow
- If no CSF: rotate needle 90 degrees (bevel may be against a nerve root); advance 1-2 mm further; recheck
- If bone is contacted: withdraw to subcutaneous tissue and redirect (more cephalad or slight lateral adjustment)

**Step 6: Opening Pressure (Lateral Decubitus Only)**
- Attach manometer via 3-way stopcock
- Have patient extend legs (uncurl from fetal position — flexion artificially raises pressure)
- Read the meniscus at the level where CSF column stops rising
- Normal: 6-20 cmH2O (adults); > 25 cmH2O = elevated
- **Elevated OP in meningitis:** bacterial > 25 cmH2O (often 30-50); cryptococcal often > 25 cmH2O (therapeutic drainage if > 25 with symptoms)

**Step 7: Collect CSF**
- Collect 1-2 mL per tube in 4 sequential numbered tubes
- Tube 1: cell count + differential
- Tube 2: glucose, protein
- Tube 3: Gram stain, culture, additional tests (viral PCR, AFB, CrAg)
- Tube 4: cell count + differential (compare to tube 1 for traumatic tap assessment)
- Additional if needed: cytology, oligoclonal bands, HSV/enterovirus PCR

**Step 8: Remove Needle**
- Replace stylet before withdrawing the needle (reduces post-LP headache)
- Apply adhesive bandage to puncture site
- Patient may remain flat or resume normal activity — bed rest does NOT prevent post-LP headache

### CSF Interpretation

| Parameter | Normal | Bacterial Meningitis | Viral Meningitis | SAH |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|-----|
| Appearance | Clear, colorless | Cloudy/purulent | Clear | Bloody → xanthochromic |
| Opening pressure | 6-20 cmH2O | > 25 (often 30-50) | Normal to mildly elevated | Normal to elevated |
| WBC (/mm3) | 0-5 | > 1000 (PMN predominant) | 10-500 (lymphocyte predominant) | Variable (with RBCs) |
| Glucose | 40-70 mg/dL (>2/3 serum) | < 40 (< 40% serum) | Normal | Normal |
| Protein | 15-45 mg/dL | > 250 | 50-200 | Elevated (with blood) |
| Gram stain | Negative | Positive (60-90%) | Negative | N/A |

**Traumatic Tap vs. SAH:**
- Traumatic tap: RBCs decrease from tube 1 to tube 4; no xanthochromia; supernatant clears with centrifugation
- SAH: RBCs consistent across all 4 tubes; xanthochromia present (yellow supernatant after centrifugation; takes > 6-12 hours to develop)

### Empiric Antibiotics for Suspected Bacterial Meningitis

| Population | Regimen |
|-----------|---------|
| Adults 18-50 | Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h |
| Adults > 50 or immunocompromised | Above + ampicillin 2 g IV q4h (Listeria coverage) |
| Pediatric (1 month-18 years) | Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV q12h + vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q6h |
| Neonates (< 1 month) | Ampicillin 200 mg/kg/day IV + gentamicin 5 mg/kg/day IV (or cefotaxime) |
| Adjunctive | Dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg IV q6h x 4 days (give BEFORE or WITH first antibiotic dose; most benefit for S. pneumoniae) |

### Post-Procedure
- Document opening pressure, CSF appearance, volumes collected, number of attempts
- Monitor for post-LP headache (positional: worse sitting/standing, better supine; onset 24-48 hours; incidence reduced 50% with atraumatic needle)
- CSF results: call stat cell count, Gram stain; cultures typically 24-48 hours

## Disposition

- **Suspected bacterial meningitis:** ICU admission; empiric antibiotics + dexamethasone started in ED
- **SAH confirmed by LP (xanthochromia):** CT angiography → neurosurgery consultation → ICU
- **Viral meningitis (clear CSF, lymphocytic, normal glucose, negative Gram stain):** may be discharged with close follow-up if clinically well; admission if toxic-appearing, immunocompromised, or HSV suspected
- **IIH (elevated OP, normal CSF composition):** therapeutic drainage (target OP < 20 cmH2O); neurology follow-up
- **Post-LP headache:** conservative management (caffeine, NSAIDs, hydration); epidural blood patch if refractory (> 48 hours)

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying antibiotics to perform LP.** In suspected bacterial meningitis, every hour of antibiotic delay increases mortality. If LP will be delayed (CT imaging, coagulopathy correction, difficult anatomy), start empiric antibiotics FIRST. CSF cultures remain positive for several hours after antibiotic initiation; cell count, glucose, and protein are unchanged.

2. **Not measuring opening pressure.** Opening pressure provides critical diagnostic information (bacterial meningitis, IIH, cryptococcal meningitis) and is often the most valuable single measurement from the LP. It can only be measured in the lateral decubitus position with legs extended. Every LP should include opening pressure measurement.

3. **Using a cutting (Quincke) needle instead of an atraumatic needle.** Atraumatic (pencil-point) needles (Sprotte, Whitacre) reduce post-LP headache by approximately 50% compared to standard cutting needles. They should be the default choice in the ED.

4. **Ruling out SAH based on a negative CT alone when the CT was obtained > 6 hours from headache onset.** CT sensitivity for SAH drops from ~98% at 6 hours to ~85% at 24 hours and ~50% at 5 days. If clinical suspicion for SAH is high and CT is negative (especially > 6 hours), LP is required to evaluate for xanthochromia. Alternatively, CT angiography may be considered per institutional protocol.

5. **Interpreting a "traumatic tap" as subarachnoid hemorrhage.** Compare tube 1 and tube 4 cell counts. A traumatic tap shows a decreasing RBC count from tube 1 to tube 4 (> 25% decrease). SAH shows consistent RBCs across all tubes and xanthochromia on centrifugation (present > 12 hours after bleed onset). Send the last tube for xanthochromia if in doubt.

6. **Performing LP in a patient with signs of impending herniation.** Focal neurologic deficits, GCS < 12, papilledema, and new seizures require CT head before LP to rule out a mass lesion. Removing CSF in the setting of a space-occupying lesion can precipitate transtentorial herniation. However, this should never delay antibiotics — start empiric treatment and image first.
