# Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (Ogilvie Syndrome)

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Massive abdominal distension developing over 2-5 days
- Typically in hospitalized, postoperative, or critically ill patients
- Abdominal pain (variable — may be minimal despite dramatic distension)
- Nausea, vomiting, obstipation (but may pass flatus or stool)
- Common precipitants: surgery (especially orthopedic/cardiac), sepsis, opioids, electrolyte derangements (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia), anticholinergics, spinal cord injury

**Exam findings:**
- Tympanitic distension, often most prominent in right lower quadrant/cecum
- Bowel sounds may be present (distinguishes from mechanical obstruction)
- Absent peritoneal signs (if present, suspect perforation or ischemia)

**Key diagnostics:**
- Abdominal X-ray: dilated colon (predominantly right and transverse), no transition point, may see haustra
- Cecal diameter measurement: risk of perforation rises at > 10-12 cm
- CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast: confirms no mechanical obstruction, evaluates cecal wall integrity and pneumatosis
- Labs: BMP (electrolytes — K, Mg, Ca), CBC, lactate

## Critical Actions

1. **NPO, aggressive IV fluid resuscitation** — correct dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities
2. **Discontinue all offending medications** — opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers
3. **Correct electrolytes** — potassium > 4.0 mEq/L, magnesium > 2.0 mg/dL
4. **Neostigmine 2 mg IV over 3-5 minutes** if conservative measures fail at 24-48 hours AND cecal diameter > 10 cm; requires cardiac monitoring (risk of bradycardia), have atropine 0.5 mg IV at bedside; contraindicated in mechanical obstruction, bradycardia, recent MI
5. **Colonoscopic decompression** if neostigmine fails or is contraindicated; success rate 60-90% but recurrence 10-30%
6. **Surgical consultation** for peritoneal signs, cecal diameter > 12 cm unresponsive to medical management, or suspected perforation/ischemia
7. **Serial abdominal X-rays q12-24h** to monitor cecal diameter
8. **Rectal tube placement** and patient positioning (prone, knee-chest) as adjuncts

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Mechanical large bowel obstruction** (transition point on CT, complete obstipation, colicky pain) — CT mandatory to exclude
- **Sigmoid or cecal volvulus** (bird-beak sign on contrast enema, coffee-bean sign on X-ray)
- **Toxic megacolon** (systemic toxicity — fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis; mucosal disease on CT)
- **Ileus** (small and large bowel both dilated, no focal dilation)
- **Hirschsprung disease** (chronic constipation, younger patients, transition zone on barium enema)

## Workup

- **Abdominal X-ray (supine and upright):** initial screening; measure cecal diameter
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** gold standard to exclude mechanical obstruction; assess for cecal wall thinning, pneumatosis, free air
- **Labs:** BMP (K, Mg, Ca, phosphorus), CBC, lactate, TSH (hypothyroidism as contributor)
- **Water-soluble contrast enema:** if CT unavailable, excludes distal mechanical obstruction

## Treatment

**Conservative management (first 24-48 hours):**
- NPO, NG tube if vomiting, rectal tube
- Aggressive electrolyte repletion
- Ambulation if patient able
- Stop all motility-reducing medications
- IV fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid

**Pharmacologic:**
- Neostigmine 2 mg IV over 3-5 minutes — response rate 80-90%; repeat dose once if no response in 3 hours
- Pre-treatment: telemetry monitoring, atropine 0.5 mg IV ready
- Contraindications: mechanical obstruction, heart rate < 60, recent MI, beta-blocker use, bronchospasm

**Endoscopic:**
- Colonoscopic decompression with placement of decompression tube
- Avoid excessive insufflation; use CO2 preferred
- Contraindicated if peritoneal signs or suspected perforation

**Surgical (cecostomy or colectomy):**
- Cecal perforation or impending perforation (diameter > 12 cm with wall thinning)
- Failed neostigmine and colonoscopic decompression
- Peritonitis

## Disposition

- **Admit all patients** — telemetry if neostigmine administered
- **ICU admission:** cecal diameter > 12 cm, hemodynamic instability, need for neostigmine monitoring
- **Surgical consultation:** obtain early; mandatory for cecal diameter > 12 cm or peritoneal signs
- **Serial imaging:** abdominal X-ray q12-24h until cecal diameter normalizing
- **No discharge** until bowel function restored and cecal diameter < 9 cm on imaging

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to exclude mechanical obstruction before giving neostigmine.** CT is mandatory. Neostigmine in mechanical obstruction risks perforation.

2. **Ignoring cecal diameter > 12 cm.** Perforation risk is 3-15% at this threshold and rises with duration. Delayed intervention carries mortality > 40% if perforation occurs.

3. **Not having atropine at bedside during neostigmine administration.** Symptomatic bradycardia occurs in 5-10% of patients. Cardiac arrest has been reported.

4. **Attributing distension to "just ileus" without measuring cecal diameter.** Ogilvie syndrome specifically involves massive cecal dilation disproportionate to overall bowel distension.

5. **Failure to correct contributing electrolyte abnormalities.** Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia perpetuate colonic dysmotility and must be corrected concurrently.

6. **Continuing opioids or anticholinergics.** These are the most common iatrogenic precipitants. Every medication list must be reviewed and offending agents discontinued.
