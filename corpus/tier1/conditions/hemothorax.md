# Hemothorax

## Recognition

**Definition:** Blood in the pleural space. Massive hemothorax: > 1500 mL initial drainage or > 200 mL/hr ongoing output for 2-4 hours.

**Mechanism:** Blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma. Sources: intercostal arteries (most common surgical bleeding), lung parenchyma (low pressure, usually self-limited), internal mammary artery, great vessels, heart.

**Presentation:**
- Dyspnea, tachypnea
- Decreased breath sounds ipsilaterally
- Dullness to percussion ipsilaterally
- Hypotension and tachycardia (hemorrhagic shock from blood loss)
- Flat neck veins (hypovolemia) — distinguishes from tension pneumothorax (JVD)
- Trachea midline or shifted away from affected side (large collection)

**Massive hemothorax (> 1500 mL or > 200 mL/hr):**
- Class III-IV hemorrhagic shock
- Complete opacification of hemithorax on CXR
- Requires immediate thoracotomy

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Large-bore IV access + fluid resuscitation | Immediate |
| Tube thoracostomy | < 15 minutes |
| Massive transfusion protocol | Activate if massive hemothorax |
| Thoracotomy | If surgical criteria met |

1. **Two large-bore (14-16G) IV lines** and initiate volume resuscitation — balanced crystalloid, then blood products
2. **Tube thoracostomy** — 36-40 Fr chest tube placed at 5th intercostal space, anterior to mid-axillary line (preferred) or 6th-7th ICS at posterior axillary line for dependent drainage. Connect to -20 cmH2O suction.
3. **Quantify initial output** — record volume drained immediately upon insertion
4. **Activate massive transfusion protocol** if initial output > 1500 mL or ongoing > 200 mL/hr
5. **Autotransfusion** — collected pleural blood can be autotransfused if available (if < 4 hours old, no enteric contamination)
6. **TXA** 1 g IV over 10 minutes within 3 hours of injury, then 1 g IV over 8 hours

## Differential Diagnosis

- Tension pneumothorax (hyperresonant, JVD; hemothorax is dull)
- Simple pneumothorax (absent breath sounds, hyperresonant, no hypotension)
- Diaphragmatic rupture with herniation (bowel sounds in chest)
- Chylothorax (milky fluid — not acute trauma presentation)
- Pleural effusion (non-traumatic — infection, malignancy)
- Pericardial tamponade (muffled heart sounds, JVD, no dullness to percussion)

## Workup

- **Chest X-ray (upright):** Blunting of costophrenic angle at 200-300 mL; complete opacification at 1500+ mL. Supine CXR underestimates — blood layers posteriorly causing diffuse haze.
- **FAST (E-FAST):** Detects hemothorax as anechoic stripe above diaphragm. Rapid bedside test.
- **CT chest with IV contrast:** Quantifies hemothorax volume, identifies active extravasation (contrast blush), and evaluates associated injuries. Obtain after initial stabilization if stable.
- **Labs:** CBC (serial q4-6h), BMP, coagulation studies, type and crossmatch, lactate, TEG/ROTEM if available
- **ABG/VBG:** Assess oxygenation, ventilation, base deficit (hemorrhagic shock marker)

## Treatment

**Tube thoracostomy:**
- 36-40 Fr for adults (large bore to drain blood and clot)
- Placement: 5th ICS, anterior or mid-axillary line (safe triangle)
- Direct the tube posteriorly and inferiorly for dependent drainage
- Secure with heavy silk suture and connect to Pleur-evac at -20 cmH2O
- Monitor output hourly

**Indications for thoracotomy (ATLS criteria):**
- Initial drainage > 1500 mL (massive hemothorax)
- Ongoing output > 200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours
- Hemodynamic instability despite resuscitation with ongoing chest tube output
- Need for ongoing transfusion to maintain hemodynamic stability
- Large retained hemothorax not draining despite adequately positioned tube

**Resuscitative thoracotomy (EDT):**
- Penetrating thoracic trauma with loss of vital signs in ED or within 15 minutes of arrival
- Left anterolateral approach at 5th ICS
- Goals: release tamponade, control cardiac hemorrhage, cross-clamp aorta, open cardiac massage

**Retained hemothorax management (EAST guideline):**
- VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) within 3-7 days — preferred over second chest tube
- Early VATS decreases empyema risk, hospital LOS, and conversion to thoracotomy
- Do NOT place a second chest tube for retained hemothorax (inferior to VATS)

**Massive transfusion protocol:**
- 1:1:1 PRBC:FFP:platelets
- Calcium replacement: CaCl2 1 g IV per 4 units PRBC (citrate chelation)
- Target: systolic BP > 90, Hgb > 7, platelets > 50K, fibrinogen > 150, INR < 1.5

## Disposition

- **ICU:** Massive hemothorax, thoracotomy, ongoing transfusion, hemodynamic instability
- **Admit (step-down/floor):** Tube thoracostomy with stable output, serial hematocrit monitoring
- **Trauma surgery consult:** All cases
- **IR consult:** Consider angioembolization for identified arterial bleeders (intercostal, internal mammary) in stable patients
- **Chest tube removal criteria:** Output < 150-200 mL/24h, no air leak, lung re-expanded on CXR
- **Transfer:** Level I trauma center if thoracic surgery not available

## Pitfalls

1. **Supine chest X-ray underestimates hemothorax.** Blood layers posteriorly in supine position, causing only diffuse haziness rather than a meniscus. Upright CXR or CT is needed for accurate assessment. E-FAST is more sensitive than supine CXR.

2. **Using a small-bore chest tube.** Hemothorax requires 36-40 Fr tubes to drain blood and clot. Small-bore tubes (pigtails, 14-20 Fr) clog and fail, leading to retained hemothorax and empyema.

3. **Placing a second chest tube for retained hemothorax instead of VATS.** EAST guideline clearly recommends VATS over additional chest tubes for retained collections. Second tubes have poor drainage rates and delay definitive treatment.

4. **Not activating massive transfusion for > 1500 mL initial output.** Massive hemothorax is a surgical emergency. Delay in transfusion and thoracotomy kills. Crystalloid alone does not resuscitate hemorrhagic shock — blood products are needed.

5. **Clamping the chest tube to "slow the bleeding."** This traps blood in the pleural space, causes tamponade physiology, and prevents monitoring of ongoing hemorrhage rate. Never clamp a chest tube draining hemothorax.

6. **Forgetting autotransfusion.** Pleural blood is effectively anticoagulated by defibrination. If collection systems with autotransfusion capability are available, this provides immediate, type-specific, warm blood in a bleeding patient.
