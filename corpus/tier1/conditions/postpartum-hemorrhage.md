# Postpartum Hemorrhage

## Recognition

**Definition:** Blood loss >= 1,000 mL OR blood loss with signs/symptoms of hypovolemia within 24 hours of delivery (ACOG 2017 revised definition). Traditional thresholds: > 500 mL after vaginal delivery, > 1,000 mL after cesarean.

**Classification:**
- **Primary (early) PPH:** Within 24 hours of delivery. Most cases. Usually uterine atony.
- **Secondary (late) PPH:** 24 hours to 12 weeks postpartum. Usually retained products, infection, subinvolution of placental site.

**The 4 Ts — Etiology Framework:**

| Cause | Frequency | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Tone** (uterine atony) | 70% | Overdistended uterus (macrosomia, polyhydramnios, multiples), prolonged labor, chorioamnionitis, magnesium use, halogenated anesthetics |
| **Trauma** | 20% | Lacerations (cervical, vaginal, perineal), uterine rupture, uterine inversion, episiotomy extension |
| **Tissue** | 10% | Retained placenta/fragments, placenta accreta spectrum, succenturiate lobe |
| **Thrombin** (coagulopathy) | 1% | DIC, preeclampsia/HELLP, amniotic fluid embolism, massive transfusion dilutional coagulopathy, preexisting coagulopathy, anticoagulant use |

**Presentation:**
- Continuous vaginal bleeding after delivery
- Boggy, non-contracted uterus (atony)
- Tachycardia (earliest sign — may precede hypotension by > 1 L blood loss)
- Hypotension (often a late finding in young obstetric patients)
- Altered mental status, pallor, diaphoresis
- Visual estimates of blood loss are inaccurate — quantitative blood loss measurement (QBL) using calibrated drapes and weighing pads is more reliable

**Exam Findings:**
- Bimanual exam: boggy vs firm uterus, retained tissue
- Speculum exam: lacerations of cervix, vagina, perineum
- Fundal height rising (uterine distension with concealed hemorrhage)

## Critical Actions

1. **Call for help early** — activate OB hemorrhage team (Stage 2-3 response) when cumulative blood loss > 500 mL vaginal / > 1,000 mL cesarean with ongoing bleeding.
2. **Quantify blood loss** — use calibrated underbuttock drapes and weigh blood-soaked materials (1 g = 1 mL). Do not rely on visual estimation.
3. **Bimanual uterine massage** — firmly compress uterus between abdominal and vaginal hands. First-line for atony. Maintain continuously until uterus is firm.
4. **Uterotonic agents** — administer immediately for atony (see Treatment).
5. **Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 minutes** — give within 3 hours of delivery onset of bleeding (WOMAN trial). Second 1 g dose if bleeding continues after 30 minutes.
6. **Identify the cause** — examine systematically using 4 Ts. Inspect cervix and vaginal canal for lacerations. Manual uterine exploration for retained tissue.
7. **Two large-bore IVs (16-gauge or larger)** — rapid crystalloid infusion, draw labs including type and screen, CBC, coagulation panel, fibrinogen.
8. **Activate massive transfusion protocol** — if EBL > 1,500 mL or hemodynamically unstable. Target 1:1:1 ratio (pRBC:FFP:platelets).

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Uterine atony | Boggy uterus, most common cause, responds to massage and uterotonics |
| Cervical/vaginal laceration | Firm uterus with continued bleeding, visible on speculum exam |
| Retained placenta/fragments | Incomplete placenta on inspection, ultrasound shows echogenic material in uterus |
| Uterine rupture | Prior cesarean scar, sudden pain, fetal distress, loss of station, palpable fetal parts through abdomen |
| Uterine inversion | Fundus not palpable abdominally, round mass at introitus or in vagina, profound vasovagal hypotension |
| Placenta accreta spectrum | Placenta fails to separate, massive hemorrhage with attempted removal, risk factors include prior cesarean and placenta previa |
| Coagulopathy / DIC | Diffuse oozing from IV sites and surgical field, non-clotting blood, low fibrinogen (< 200 mg/dL) |
| Amniotic fluid embolism | Sudden cardiovascular collapse, hypoxia, DIC, often peri-delivery |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- CBC (baseline hemoglobin; serial q30-60 min during active hemorrhage)
- Type and screen / crossmatch (2-4 units pRBC)
- Coagulation panel (PT, PTT, INR)
- Fibrinogen — critical in PPH. Level < 200 mg/dL predicts severe PPH; < 100 mg/dL = DIC. Cryoprecipitate if < 200 mg/dL.
- Metabolic panel (lactate, calcium — hypocalcemia from citrated blood products)
- Point-of-care TEG/ROTEM if available — guides targeted component therapy

**Imaging:**
- Bedside ultrasound: assess uterine cavity for retained products, evaluate uterine tone
- Formal pelvic ultrasound if retained products suspected and patient stable
- CT angiography if arterial bleeding source needed for interventional radiology planning (stable patients only)

## Treatment

**Bimanual Uterine Massage:**
- Vaginal hand in anterior fornix/lower uterine segment, abdominal hand on fundus
- Compress uterus between hands with firm, continuous pressure
- Continue until uterus is firm and contracted

**Uterotonic Agents (administer stepwise for atony):**

| Agent | Dose/Route | Onset | Contraindications |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| **Oxytocin** | 10-40 units in 500-1000 mL NS IV infusion (run wide open); or 10 units IM | 2-3 min IV | None absolute; avoid rapid IV push (hypotension) |
| **Methylergonovine (Methergine)** | 0.2 mg IM q2-4h (max 5 doses) | 2-5 min | Hypertension, preeclampsia (causes vasoconstriction) |
| **Carboprost (Hemabate/15-methyl PGF2-alpha)** | 250 mcg IM or intramyometrial q15-90 min (max 8 doses / 2 mg) | 5-15 min | Asthma (bronchospasm), active cardiac/pulmonary/hepatic/renal disease |
| **Misoprostol (Cytotec)** | 800-1000 mcg rectally; or 600 mcg sublingual | 10-20 min | None absolute (use with caution if prior uterine surgery) |

**Tranexamic Acid:**
- 1 g IV over 10 minutes, given within 3 hours of bleeding onset (WOMAN trial: reduced death from bleeding by 19%)
- If bleeding continues after 30 minutes or restarts within 24 hours: second dose 1 g IV
- Do NOT give > 3 hours after delivery — no benefit after this window (WOMAN trial)

**Intrauterine Balloon Tamponade:**
- Indicated when uterotonics and massage fail
- Bakri balloon: insert transcervically, inflate with 300-500 mL sterile saline, apply gentle traction
- Condom catheter as alternative
- Pack vagina below balloon for retention
- Continuous oxytocin infusion during tamponade
- If tamponade fails ("tamponade test negative"), proceed to surgical intervention

**Uterine Compression Sutures:**
- B-Lynch suture (most common), Hayman, Cho suture techniques
- Performed at laparotomy

**Uterine Artery Embolization:**
- Interventional radiology if available and patient stable enough for transport
- 85-95% success rate

**Surgical — Last Resort:**
- Uterine artery ligation (O'Leary sutures)
- Internal iliac artery ligation
- Hysterectomy — definitive treatment when all else fails. Do not delay if patient deteriorating.

**Massive Transfusion:**
- Activate protocol early (EBL > 1,500 mL, ongoing hemorrhage, hemodynamic instability)
- Target 1:1:1 ratio of pRBC:FFP:platelets
- Cryoprecipitate 10 units if fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL
- Calcium gluconate 1-2 g IV for citrate-induced hypocalcemia (q4 units blood)
- Avoid hypothermia: use fluid warmers, forced-air warming

**For Uterine Inversion:**
- Manual replacement: push fundus through cervix back to anatomic position using Johnson maneuver
- Uterine relaxation with nitroglycerin 50-200 mcg IV, terbutaline 0.25 mg IV/SQ, or general anesthesia with halogenated agents
- Do NOT remove placenta before repositioning if still attached

## Disposition

**ICU/High Acuity Admission:**
- Massive transfusion activated
- DIC or coagulopathy
- Surgical intervention required
- Hemodynamic instability after resuscitation
- EBL > 1,500 mL

**Postpartum Floor Admission:**
- All patients with PPH requiring uterotonics beyond oxytocin
- Balloon tamponade in situ
- Ongoing monitoring of blood loss, vitals, urine output

**Transfer:**
- If delivery facility lacks surgical capability, OB anesthesia, blood bank, or interventional radiology — initiate transfer early before patient decompensates. Bimanual massage, uterotonics, TXA, and IV resuscitation are bridging measures during transport.

## Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating blood loss by visual estimation.** Visual estimates undercount by 30-50%. Use quantitative blood loss measurement (calibrated drapes, weighed pads). A young obstetric patient compensates until > 1,500 mL loss, then decompensates rapidly.

2. **Delayed activation of massive transfusion.** Obstetric patients have expanded blood volume (4.5-6 L) and maintain normal vitals despite significant hemorrhage. By the time hypotension appears, 30-40% of blood volume is lost. Activate MTP based on cumulative blood loss, not waiting for vital sign changes.

3. **Failing to give TXA within the 3-hour window.** The WOMAN trial demonstrated TXA benefit only when given within 3 hours of bleeding onset. Every hour of delay reduces efficacy. Administer early — at the point PPH is recognized, not after uterotonics fail.

4. **Skipping systematic 4 Ts assessment.** Treating all PPH as atony when 30% have a non-atony etiology. A firm uterus with ongoing bleeding means lacerations, retained tissue, or coagulopathy — uterotonics will not fix it. Examine the cervix, vaginal canal, and placenta.

5. **Using methylergonovine in preeclampsia/hypertension.** Methylergonovine causes vasoconstriction and can trigger severe hypertension, seizures, or stroke in preeclamptic patients. Use carboprost or misoprostol instead. Equally, avoid carboprost in asthmatics.

6. **Delaying hysterectomy in a deteriorating patient.** Performing one more round of uterotonics, one more compression suture, one more balloon while the patient exsanguinates. When stepwise interventions fail and bleeding persists, peripartum hysterectomy is life-saving. The decision to proceed should not require consensus — hemorrhagic shock is irreversible beyond a point.

7. **Forgetting to replace fibrinogen.** Fibrinogen is consumed early in PPH and is the best predictor of severity. A fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL mandates cryoprecipitate (10 units). Standard FFP provides insufficient fibrinogen concentration. Not checking fibrinogen serially during massive PPH leads to preventable coagulopathy.

8. **Neglecting calcium replacement during massive transfusion.** Citrate in banked blood chelates calcium. Hypocalcemia causes myocardial depression and coagulopathy, worsening hemorrhage. Give calcium gluconate 1-2 g IV for every 4 units of blood products transfused.

9. **Attempting to remove a retained placenta in the ED without anesthesia or surgical backup.** Manual removal of a retained placenta risks uterine perforation and worsened hemorrhage, particularly in placenta accreta spectrum. Ensure anesthesia and OR availability before attempting.

10. **Missing concealed hemorrhage.** A rising fundal height with a firm uterus and no external bleeding suggests blood accumulating behind membranes or a broad ligament hematoma. Palpate the fundus serially and monitor for rising heart rate disproportionate to visible blood loss.
