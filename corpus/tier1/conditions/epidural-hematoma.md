# Epidural Hematoma

## Recognition

**Definition:** Arterial (or less commonly venous) hemorrhage between the inner skull table and the dura mater, forming a lens-shaped (biconvex) hematoma that compresses the underlying brain.

**Epidemiology:**
- 1-4% of traumatic brain injuries, 5-15% of fatal head injuries
- Peak incidence age 20-30 years; rare in < 2 years (dura tightly adherent to skull) and > 60 years (dura progressively adherent)
- Male:female 4:1
- 85-95% associated with skull fracture (temporal bone most common)

**Pathophysiology — "Talk and Die" Lesion:**
- Temporal bone fracture lacerates the middle meningeal artery (75-80% of cases)
- Arterial bleeding rapidly accumulates in epidural space (can reach 50-150 mL within 1-3 hours)
- Initial impact may cause brief LOC (concussion from primary injury)
- **Lucid interval:** Patient regains consciousness, appears well for 30 minutes to several hours
- Expanding hematoma causes uncal herniation: ipsilateral pupil dilation (CN III compression), contralateral hemiparesis, then bilateral posturing, brainstem compression, death
- Present in 20-50% of cases; absence does not exclude EDH

**Other sources:**
- Middle meningeal vein (10%)
- Dural venous sinuses (especially posterior fossa EDH in children)
- Diploic veins
- Venous EDH accumulates more slowly; may present subacutely

**Presentation:**
- History of head trauma (assault, fall, sports injury, MVC — typically temporoparietal impact)
- Headache (most common symptom)
- Transient loss of consciousness followed by lucid interval (classic but not universal)
- Progressive deterioration: increasing headache, vomiting, confusion, lethargy
- Unilateral (ipsilateral) fixed dilated pupil — uncal herniation
- Contralateral hemiparesis (Kernohan notch phenomenon: ipsilateral hemiparesis from contralateral peduncle compression is a false localizing sign in ~25%)
- Cushing response (hypertension, bradycardia, irregular respirations) — late, ominous
- Seizures (25% of cases)
- GCS decline

**Exam Findings:**
- Temporal/parietal scalp swelling, laceration, or hematoma
- Battle sign, raccoon eyes (may be absent early)
- Anisocoria — ipsilateral mydriasis (CN III compression)
- Focal motor deficits
- Decreasing GCS on serial exams
- Papilledema (if subacute presentation)

## Critical Actions

1. **Stabilize airway** — intubate for GCS <= 8 using rapid sequence intubation. Avoid hypoxia (SpO2 < 90%) and hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) — both independently double mortality in TBI.
2. **Non-contrast CT head** — immediately on any head trauma patient with LOC, GCS < 15, focal deficits, vomiting, or lucid interval history. CT shows biconvex (lenticular) hyperdensity.
3. **Emergent neurosurgical consultation** — call at time of CT, not after results. Surgical decompression within 1-2 hours of deterioration is the goal.
4. **ICP management while awaiting OR:**
   - Elevate head of bed to 30 degrees
   - Mannitol 1 g/kg IV bolus (20% solution) for signs of herniation
   - OR hypertonic saline 23.4% 30 mL IV over 10-20 minutes via central line (or 3% NaCl 250 mL IV bolus via peripheral line, can repeat)
5. **Reverse anticoagulation** — if on warfarin: 4-factor PCC 25-50 IU/kg IV + vitamin K 10 mg IV. If on DOAC: andexanet alfa or 4-factor PCC. If on antiplatelet: platelet transfusion (evidence debated but reasonable with active hemorrhage and planned surgery).
6. **Avoid secondary brain injury:**
   - Target SBP > 100 mmHg (age > 49) or > 110 mmHg (age 15-49) per BTF guidelines
   - Maintain PaO2 > 60 mmHg, SpO2 > 94%
   - Target normothermia (avoid hyperthermia)
   - Maintain normoglycemia
   - Seizure prophylaxis: levetiracetam 1,000-1,500 mg IV or phenytoin/fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Subdural hematoma (SDH) | Crescent-shaped hyperdensity crossing suture lines, bridging vein source, older/anticoagulated patients, no lucid interval (acute SDH) |
| Subarachnoid hemorrhage (traumatic) | Sulcal/cisternal blood on CT, often accompanies other TBI |
| Intracerebral hemorrhage (traumatic contusion) | Intraparenchymal hyperdensity, often frontal/temporal (coup-contrecoup), no extraaxial collection |
| Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis | Headache, may have hemorrhagic infarct, "empty delta" sign on CT venogram, no acute trauma |
| Brain abscess | Ring-enhancing lesion, subacute presentation, fever, no acute trauma |
| Meningioma (en plaque) | Can mimic chronic EDH on imaging, no acute trauma history, incidental finding |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- **Non-contrast CT head** — diagnostic study of choice. Findings:
  - **Biconvex (lenticular/lens-shaped) hyperdensity** between skull and dura
  - Does NOT cross suture lines (dura is attached at sutures) — key distinction from SDH
  - Most common location: temporal/temporoparietal (middle meningeal artery territory)
  - Associated temporal bone fracture in 85-95%
  - Midline shift (measure septum pellucidum displacement)
  - Effacement of ipsilateral lateral ventricle
  - "Swirl sign": mixed hyper/hypodensity indicates active bleeding (surgical emergency)
  - Volume estimation: ABC/2 method (A = maximal diameter in cm x B = perpendicular diameter x C = number of CT slices with blood x slice thickness / 2)
- **CT angiography** — if concern for vascular injury (skull base fracture, vertex fracture near sagittal sinus)
- **Skull radiograph** — NOT adequate for evaluating intracranial hemorrhage. A fracture line crossing the middle meningeal artery groove warrants CT even if asymptomatic.

**Labs:**
- CBC, BMP, coagulation panel (PT/INR, PTT), type and screen/crossmatch
- Blood alcohol level, urine toxicology (confounders of neurological exam)
- Platelet function studies if on antiplatelet agents (if available)

## Treatment

**Surgical Management — Emergent Craniotomy:**

**Indications for surgery (Brain Trauma Foundation / Bullock 2006):**
- EDH volume > 30 mL regardless of GCS
- Hematoma thickness > 15 mm
- Midline shift > 5 mm
- Any neurological deficit attributable to the EDH
- GCS <= 8 with anisocoria

**Procedure:** Temporal craniotomy with hematoma evacuation and middle meningeal artery ligation/cauterization. Burr holes as temporizing measure if craniotomy not immediately available.

**Timing:** Operate within 1-2 hours of neurological deterioration. Mortality < 10% with prompt evacuation; near 100% without intervention when herniation is present.

**Medical Management (ICP reduction while awaiting OR):**

| Intervention | Dose/Details |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Head of bed elevation** | 30 degrees, midline position, loosen cervical collar if safe |
| **Mannitol** | 1 g/kg IV bolus (20% solution, via peripheral or central line). Can repeat 0.25-0.5 g/kg q4-6h. Hold if serum osmolality > 320 mOsm/L or SBP < 90 mmHg. |
| **Hypertonic saline 23.4%** | 30 mL IV over 10-20 min via central line. Alternative to mannitol. Preferred if hypotensive (does not cause osmotic diuresis). |
| **Hypertonic saline 3%** | 250 mL IV bolus via peripheral line (can repeat); alternative if no central access |
| **Hyperventilation** | Target PaCO2 30-35 mmHg ONLY as temporizing bridge to OR (< 30 min). Sustained hyperventilation causes cerebral ischemia — avoid routine use. |
| **Seizure prophylaxis** | Levetiracetam 1,000-1,500 mg IV loading dose or fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV |

**Non-operative Management:**
- Selected cases only:
  - EDH < 30 mL AND thickness < 15 mm AND midline shift < 5 mm
  - GCS > 8 with no focal neurological deficits
  - NOT in temporal location (higher risk of rapid expansion)
- Requires: ICU admission, serial neuro exams q1h, repeat CT at 6-8 hours and at any neurological change
- Low threshold to proceed to surgery — 10-30% of initially non-operative EDH will require delayed surgery

**Posterior Fossa EDH:**
- Surgical threshold lower than supratentorial — small hematomas can cause rapid brainstem compression and obstructive hydrocephalus
- Evacuate if any signs of brainstem dysfunction, hydrocephalus, or hematoma > 10 mL
- Consider suboccipital craniectomy

## Disposition

**Operating Room (emergent):**
- All EDH meeting surgical criteria
- Any patient with declining GCS, anisocoria, or focal deficit

**Neurosurgical ICU:**
- All operative EDH patients postoperatively
- Non-operative EDH for serial monitoring (q1h neuro checks, repeat CT at 6-8 hours)

**Transfer:**
- If no neurosurgery available: stabilize, initiate ICP-lowering measures, arrange emergent transfer. Mannitol or hypertonic saline and seizure prophylaxis are bridging measures. Do not wait for clinical deterioration to transfer — transfer at time of CT diagnosis.

**Discharge:**
- EDH is NOT an ED discharge diagnosis. All patients with EDH on CT require admission and neurosurgical evaluation.

## Pitfalls

1. **Discharging the "lucid interval" patient.** A patient with head trauma, brief LOC, and a now-normal exam may harbor a small, expanding EDH. Any patient with LOC after head trauma requires CT. A normal initial exam does not exclude EDH — it may represent the lucid interval before deterioration.

2. **Attributing altered mental status to intoxication.** Alcohol and drug intoxication are common in trauma patients and commonly coexist with significant TBI. A head-injured, intoxicated patient with altered mental status requires CT. Intoxication is a diagnosis of exclusion in the setting of head trauma.

3. **Delaying CT for "clinical observation."** In head trauma with any red flag (LOC, amnesia, vomiting, GCS < 15, focal signs, coagulopathy, age > 65, dangerous mechanism), CT should be obtained immediately. EDH expands rapidly; the window between lucid interval and herniation can be < 1 hour.

4. **Confusing EDH with SDH on CT.** EDH is biconvex (lens-shaped) and does not cross suture lines. SDH is crescent-shaped and crosses suture lines. The distinction matters: EDH is typically arterial, rapidly expanding, and surgically curable with excellent outcomes. Misidentification delays appropriate surgical planning.

5. **Using hyperventilation as sustained ICP management.** Hyperventilation (PaCO2 < 35 mmHg) causes cerebral vasoconstriction and reduces ICP but also reduces cerebral blood flow, risking ischemia. Use only as a bridge to OR for active herniation, for no more than 15-30 minutes. Sustained hyperventilation worsens outcomes.

6. **Failing to recognize posterior fossa EDH.** Posterior fossa EDH is uncommon but rapidly lethal due to brainstem compression and obstructive hydrocephalus. The surgical threshold is lower (> 10 mL or any brainstem signs). Ensure the posterior fossa is evaluated on CT — small collections here are more dangerous than larger supratentorial collections.

7. **Not repeating CT with any neurological change.** Non-operative EDH requires serial imaging. Any GCS drop, new deficit, or worsening headache/vomiting mandates immediate repeat CT. Delayed expansion occurs in 10-30% of initially small, non-operative EDH, particularly in the first 6-8 hours.

8. **Allowing secondary brain injury.** Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) and hypoxia (SpO2 < 90%) each independently double TBI mortality. Aggressive resuscitation targeting SBP > 100-110 mmHg and SpO2 > 94% is as critical as surgical evacuation. Permissive hypotension protocols for polytrauma do NOT apply to TBI.

9. **Forgetting anticoagulant reversal.** Patients on warfarin, DOACs, or antiplatelet agents with EDH require immediate reversal. 4-factor PCC (25-50 IU/kg IV) reverses warfarin faster than FFP. Every minute of continued coagulopathy allows hematoma expansion. Check and reverse before the patient reaches the OR.

10. **Overlooking the pediatric posterior fossa EDH from venous sinuses.** In children, EDH more commonly involves the posterior fossa and arises from dural venous sinuses rather than the middle meningeal artery. These may expand more slowly but are equally dangerous. Low threshold for CT in pediatric head trauma with occipital impact.
