# Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage

## Recognition

### Upper GI Bleed (proximal to ligament of Treitz)
- **Hematemesis:** Bright red blood or coffee-ground emesis
- **Melena:** Black, tarry, malodorous stool (requires ~150 mL blood in upper GI tract)
- **Hematochezia from upper source:** Brisk upper GI bleed with rapid transit

**Common causes:** Peptic ulcer disease (35-50%), esophageal/gastric varices (10-20%), Mallory-Weiss tear, erosive gastritis/esophagitis, Dieulafoy lesion, malignancy

### Lower GI Bleed (distal to ligament of Treitz)
- **Hematochezia:** Bright red or maroon blood per rectum
- **Melena:** Possible from right-sided colonic or small bowel source with slow transit

**Common causes:** Diverticulosis (30-40%), angiodysplasia, colitis (ischemic, infectious, IBD), hemorrhoids, post-polypectomy bleeding, malignancy

### Signs of Hemodynamic Significance
- Tachycardia (HR > 100) — earliest sign
- Hypotension (SBP < 90) — indicates >30% blood volume loss
- Orthostatic vital sign changes (SBP drop > 20 or HR increase > 20 on standing)
- Altered mental status, diaphoresis, pallor
- Syncope or pre-syncope
- Hemoglobin < 7 g/dL or rapidly dropping

### Risk Stratification
**Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS)** for UGIB: Score 0-1 identifies very low risk patients suitable for outpatient management. Incorporates BUN, hemoglobin, SBP, HR, melena, syncope, hepatic disease, heart failure.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Two large-bore IVs (16-18G) | Immediately |
| Type and crossmatch | Immediately; activate massive transfusion protocol if hemodynamically unstable |
| Crystalloid resuscitation | Maintain perfusion while awaiting blood products |
| pRBC transfusion | Hemoglobin < 7 g/dL (restrictive); threshold 8-9 g/dL if active coronary disease |
| Octreotide + antibiotics | If variceal bleed suspected |
| GI consultation | Within 1 hour for urgent/emergent endoscopy |
| PPI infusion | UGIB: pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus |

1. Establish two large-bore (16-18G) peripheral IVs
2. Send type and crossmatch, CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, lactate
3. Begin volume resuscitation with crystalloid
4. Transfuse pRBCs for hemoglobin < 7 g/dL or hemodynamic instability (do not wait for lab Hgb in actively hemorrhaging patients)
5. Activate massive transfusion protocol (1:1:1 pRBC:FFP:platelets) for hemorrhagic shock
6. Administer pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus for suspected UGIB
7. Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus then 50 mcg/hour infusion if variceal bleed suspected
8. Consult GI for endoscopy

## Differential Diagnosis

- Epistaxis with swallowed blood (anterior rhinoscopy)
- Hemoptysis (cough-associated, frothy, pulmonary source)
- Aortoenteric fistula (history of aortic graft, herald bleed followed by massive hemorrhage)
- Meckel diverticulum (younger patients, painless lower GI bleed)
- Upper GI source mimicking lower GI bleed (rapid transit UGIB causes hematochezia)
- Iron/bismuth ingestion (black stool without occult blood positivity)
- Coagulopathy-related bleeding (anticoagulant use, liver disease, DIC)

## Workup

- **CBC:** Hemoglobin/hematocrit (initial Hgb may be normal in acute hemorrhage before equilibration; trend serially)
- **Type and crossmatch:** Minimum 2 units; 6 units for massive hemorrhage
- **BMP:** BUN (elevated BUN:creatinine ratio > 20:1 suggests UGIB), creatinine, electrolytes
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR, aPTT — especially in liver disease and anticoagulant use
- **Lactate:** Marker of tissue hypoperfusion and hemorrhagic shock severity
- **LFTs:** Evaluate for underlying liver disease (varices)
- **Lipase:** Exclude pancreatitis if epigastric pain present
- **ECG:** Demand ischemia from anemia, especially in older patients
- **NG aspirate/lavage:** Coffee-ground or bloody aspirate localizes to UGIB; clear aspirate does NOT exclude UGIB (10-15% false-negative rate from duodenal source)
- **Rectal exam:** Stool color, hemorrhoids, masses
- **CT angiography abdomen/pelvis:** Active extravasation seen at rates >0.3-0.5 mL/min; useful when endoscopy unavailable or patient too unstable
- **Point-of-care ultrasound:** IVC collapsibility for volume status, free fluid

## Treatment

### Resuscitation
- **Crystalloid:** Lactated Ringer's for initial volume expansion; avoid excessive crystalloid (dilutional coagulopathy)
- **Restrictive transfusion:** Target hemoglobin >= 7 g/dL (Villanueva et al., NEJM 2013: restrictive strategy improved survival in UGIB)
- **Liberal transfusion threshold (Hgb 8-9 g/dL):** Active coronary disease, hemodynamic instability despite fluids, ongoing massive hemorrhage
- **Massive transfusion protocol:** 1:1:1 ratio pRBC:FFP:platelets for hemorrhagic shock
- **Tranexamic acid:** NOT routinely recommended for GI bleeding (HALT-IT trial: no mortality benefit, increased VTE)

### Upper GI Bleed — Non-Variceal
- **Pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus, then 8 mg/hour continuous infusion** — reduces rebleeding after endoscopic therapy
- **Erythromycin 250 mg IV over 20 minutes** 30-60 minutes pre-endoscopy (prokinetic; improves visualization). Alternatively metoclopramide 10 mg IV.
- **Endoscopy within 24 hours** for most UGIB; within 12 hours for high-risk features (hemodynamic instability, bloody NG aspirate, hematemesis)
- Reverse anticoagulants: warfarin — vitamin K 10 mg IV + 4-factor PCC 25-50 units/kg IV; DOACs — idarucizumab 5 g IV for dabigatran, andexanet alfa or 4-factor PCC for factor Xa inhibitors

### Upper GI Bleed — Variceal
- **Octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus, then 50 mcg/hour continuous infusion x 3-5 days** (reduces portal pressure)
- **Ceftriaxone 1 g IV every 24 hours x 7 days** (antibiotic prophylaxis reduces infection and mortality in cirrhotic patients with GI bleed)
- **Endoscopic variceal band ligation:** Within 12 hours
- **Balloon tamponade (Sengstaken-Blakemore or Minnesota tube):** Temporizing for uncontrolled variceal hemorrhage unresponsive to endoscopy; maximum 24 hours
- **TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt):** For refractory variceal bleeding after failed endoscopic therapy
- Avoid overaggressive volume resuscitation in variceal bleed (raises portal pressure)

### Lower GI Bleed
- **Colonoscopy within 24 hours** after bowel prep for hemodynamically stable patients
- **CT angiography:** If hemodynamically unstable or rapid bleeding precludes colonoscopy
- **Angiographic embolization:** For active extravasation identified on CTA
- **Surgical consultation:** For massive ongoing hemorrhage unresponsive to endoscopic and angiographic intervention

## Disposition

- **ICU:** Hemodynamic instability, active hemorrhage requiring transfusion, variceal bleed, need for massive transfusion protocol, post-endoscopic high-risk lesion (Forrest Ia/Ib)
- **Step-down/monitored bed:** Stabilized after resuscitation, awaiting endoscopy, high Glasgow-Blatchford Score
- **General medical floor:** Low-risk UGIB (GBS 0-1 after stabilization), stable lower GI bleed awaiting colonoscopy
- **Discharge:** GBS 0-1 with no hemodynamic compromise, no active bleeding, reliable follow-up for outpatient endoscopy within 72 hours; not on anticoagulants; adequate social support

## Pitfalls

1. **Trusting an initial normal hemoglobin in acute hemorrhage.** Hemoglobin does not equilibrate for 6-24 hours after acute blood loss. A patient in hemorrhagic shock with a normal Hgb is still hemorrhaging. Resuscitate based on hemodynamics, not lab values.

2. **Interpreting a clear NG aspirate as excluding UGIB.** A duodenal source with a competent pylorus produces a clear or bilious aspirate. NG aspirate has a 10-15% false-negative rate for UGIB. If clinical suspicion is high, proceed with upper endoscopy.

3. **Missing aortoenteric fistula.** Any patient with a prior aortic graft presenting with GI bleeding has an aortoenteric fistula until proven otherwise. The "herald bleed" (small initial bleed) precedes catastrophic exsanguination by hours to days. CT angiography is the initial diagnostic study.

4. **Aggressively resuscitating variceal hemorrhage with crystalloid.** Overaggressive volume expansion raises portal pressure and worsens variceal bleeding. Use a restrictive strategy. Transfuse to hemoglobin 7 g/dL. Start octreotide early.

5. **Omitting antibiotic prophylaxis in cirrhotic patients with GI bleed.** Ceftriaxone 1 g IV daily x 7 days reduces bacterial infections and mortality in cirrhotic patients with GI hemorrhage regardless of bleed source. This is standard of care per Baveno VII.

6. **Delaying endoscopy in high-risk UGIB.** Hemodynamically significant UGIB (active hematemesis, shock, bloody NG aspirate) requires endoscopy within 12 hours. Waiting for "optimization" in an actively hemorrhaging patient costs lives.

7. **Forgetting to reverse anticoagulants.** Warfarin: 4-factor PCC 25-50 units/kg IV provides immediate reversal (faster than FFP). Vitamin K 10 mg IV takes 6-12 hours for full effect. DOACs: idarucizumab for dabigatran; andexanet alfa or PCC for factor Xa inhibitors.

8. **Attributing hematochezia solely to hemorrhoids without further workup.** Hemorrhoids are common but new-onset hematochezia warrants evaluation for proximal pathology, especially in patients >40, with anemia, weight loss, or family history of colorectal cancer.

9. **Not obtaining an ECG in elderly patients with GI hemorrhage.** Acute anemia causes demand ischemia. Obtain ECG and troponin in patients >50, with CAD, or with any chest symptoms.
