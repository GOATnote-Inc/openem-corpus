# Uterine Rupture

## Recognition

**Definition:** Full-thickness disruption of the uterine wall including uterine serosa. Distinct from dehiscence (scar separation without serosa breach). Rupture results in hemorrhage, fetal-placental displacement, and acute fetal compromise.

**Incidence:**
- TOLAC (trial of labor after cesarean): 0.47–1.0%
- Planned repeat cesarean without labor: 0.03%
- Unscarred uterus: < 0.01% (rare; typically from obstructed labor, trauma, or fundal instrumentation)
- Risk highest with induction of labor, short inter-delivery interval (< 18 months), prostaglandin use in scarred uterus

**Presenting Signs and Symptoms:**

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Sudden severe abdominal pain** | Acute onset; may persist between contractions or occur at rest; pain may briefly improve then worsen |
| **Fetal bradycardia / prolonged deceleration** | Most consistent early sign; Category III tracing or prolonged deceleration > 3 minutes; loss of previously normal variability |
| **Loss of fetal station** | Previously engaged presenting part rises out of pelvis — palpable change on vaginal exam |
| **Change in uterine contour** | Uterus loses its globular shape; irregular contour; fetal parts palpated through abdominal wall |
| **Maternal hemodynamic instability** | Hypotension, tachycardia, diaphoresis — may be sudden and profound |
| **Shoulder-tip pain** | Diaphragmatic irritation from hemoperitoneum |
| **Cessation of contractions** | Sudden loss of uterine tone and contractions may precede or accompany rupture |
| **Vaginal bleeding** | Variable — may be minimal if hemorrhage is intraperitoneal |
| **Hematuria** | Suggests bladder involvement |

**Key Distinction — Dehiscence vs Rupture:**
- **Dehiscence:** Scar separation without serosa breach; often asymptomatic; discovered incidentally at cesarean; fetal heart tones normal; managed with cesarean delivery
- **Rupture:** Full-thickness tear; fetal compromise; maternal hemodynamic instability; intraperitoneal hemorrhage; surgical emergency

**Risk Factors:**
- Prior uterine surgery (cesarean most important; also myomectomy, cornual resection, uterine repair)
- Number of prior uterine incisions (each adds incremental risk)
- Type of uterine incision: classical (vertical) or T-shaped incision has 4–9% rupture risk vs. low transverse < 1%
- Labor induction (especially prostaglandin use in scarred uterus — relative risk 3–15x vs. spontaneous labor)
- Short inter-delivery interval < 18 months
- Macrosomia, obstructed labor, grand multiparity
- Uterine anomalies, adenomyosis, prior uterine perforation

## Critical Actions

1. **Call the OB emergency team immediately.** OB, anesthesia, OR nursing, neonatology. Activate massive obstetric hemorrhage protocol. This is not a workup-first scenario.

2. **Two large-bore IVs (16-gauge or larger).** Rapid crystalloid bolus 1–2 L warmed LR or NS. Draw: CBC, type and crossmatch (4 units pRBC), BMP, PT/INR/PTT, fibrinogen.

3. **Supplemental oxygen via non-rebreather mask.** Continuous maternal pulse oximetry and fetal heart rate monitoring.

4. **Activate massive transfusion protocol** if hemodynamic instability present. Do not wait for lab confirmation. Transfuse O-negative pRBC until crossmatch complete; target 1:1:1 ratio (pRBC:FFP:platelets).

5. **Do NOT delay surgery for imaging.** Diagnosis is clinical. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with suspected uterine rupture, immediate laparotomy is the only diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Ultrasound may be used at the bedside in stable patients only.

6. **Urgent cesarean delivery** — the only definitive treatment. Delivery via laparotomy (classical midline incision for speed in emergency). Extract fetus and placenta.

7. **Uterine repair vs. hysterectomy** — decision made intraoperatively based on extent of rupture, patient hemodynamic status, and desire for future fertility. Repair is preferred if feasible; peripartum hysterectomy is definitive for uncontrollable hemorrhage or complex multi-site rupture.

8. **Neonatal resuscitation team at bedside** — fetal outcome is time-dependent; neonatology must be present at delivery.

9. **Terbutaline 0.25 mg SC or IV** — may be given as a tocolytic temporizing measure to reduce uterine contractions if immediate OR is not yet available, but do NOT delay surgery for this.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Placental abruption | Painful bleeding, board-like abdomen, category II/III tracing but fetal station maintained, uterus remains palpable and globular |
| Vasa previa with rupture | Painless hemorrhage at membrane rupture, fetal bradycardia immediately following amniotomy or spontaneous ROM, APT test positive |
| Severe placenta previa | Painless vaginal bleeding, fetal position normal, no hemoperitoneum |
| Amniotic fluid embolism | Sudden cardiovascular collapse and DIC peri-delivery, typically no abdominal pain or contour change |
| Uterine inversion | Fundus absent on abdominal exam, mass at introitus or in vagina, profound vasovagal shock |
| Cord prolapse | Cord palpable on vaginal exam, bradycardia on FHR, no maternal hemodynamic instability unless prolonged |
| Scar dehiscence | Fetal heart tones preserved, no maternal instability, usually discovered at scheduled cesarean |

## Workup

**In the Hemodynamically Unstable Patient:**
- Labs simultaneously with resuscitation: CBC, type and crossmatch (do not delay OR for results)
- No imaging — go to OR

**In the Hemodynamically Stable Patient:**
- Bedside ultrasound: assess for free fluid (hemoperitoneum), fetal lie, fetal cardiac activity, placental location
- Continuous electronic fetal monitoring — prolonged deceleration or bradycardia is the most consistent indicator
- Urgent OB consultation for formal evaluation
- MRI: if stable and diagnosis uncertain prior to operative decision; rarely used acutely

**Intraoperative Diagnosis:**
- Confirmed by laparotomy: visualization of uterine defect, fetal/placental extrusion or partial extrusion into peritoneal cavity, hemoperitoneum

## Treatment

**Resuscitation:**
- Warmed crystalloid 1–2 L IV; do not exceed 2 L before transitioning to blood products (dilutional coagulopathy risk)
- pRBC: transfuse O-negative until crossmatch, then type-specific
- Massive transfusion protocol: 1:1:1 (pRBC:FFP:platelets)
- Cryoprecipitate 10 units for fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL
- Calcium gluconate 1–2 g IV for every 4 units blood products transfused
- Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 minutes — give early for any obstetric hemorrhage (WHO recommendation)
- Vasopressors (norepinephrine 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min) for refractory hypotension as bridge to surgical control

**Surgical — Definitive:**

**Uterine Repair (preferred when feasible):**
- Indicated for: lower uterine segment rupture with clean edges, hemodynamically stable patient, desire for future fertility
- Two-layer myometrial closure with absorbable suture (vicryl 0 or 1-0)
- Repair of bladder if involved
- Drainage may be left if contamination present

**Peripartum Hysterectomy (definitive):**
- Indicated for: complex rupture, multiple sites, uncontrollable hemorrhage, advanced uterine damage, completed family
- Total vs. subtotal hysterectomy — subtotal (supracervical) is faster in extremis; total if cervical involvement
- O'Leary sutures (uterine artery ligation) as temporizing step before hysterectomy if hemorrhage control needed

**Bilateral Uterine Artery Embolization:**
- Option for hemodynamically stable patient in facility with immediate interventional radiology
- Not appropriate for the unstable patient or when fetal compromise mandates immediate delivery

**Post-Surgical:**
- ICU admission, serial hemoglobin/coagulation labs q4–6 hours
- Monitor for post-operative hemorrhage, ureteral injury, bladder injury, ileus
- Neonatal assessment: cord pH, Apgar scores, monitoring for HIE

## Disposition

**All patients with uterine rupture require immediate OR, then ICU.**

**ICU Admission Criteria (all patients post-laparotomy for rupture):**
- Hemodynamic monitoring post-massive transfusion
- Coagulopathy monitoring and correction
- Mechanical ventilation if required
- Renal monitoring (AKI from hemorrhage and hypoperfusion)
- Uterine artery embolization patients require IR suite then ICU

**Transfer:**
- If uterine rupture is suspected and facility lacks OB anesthesia, OR, or blood bank: initiate urgent transfer. Resuscitate, establish IV access, transfuse O-negative blood during transport. Do not delay transfer waiting for full resuscitation.

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing fetal bradycardia to other causes without considering uterine rupture.** Prolonged deceleration during TOLAC is uterine rupture until proven otherwise. Any Category III tracing with prolonged deceleration in a patient with a uterine scar mandates immediate evaluation for rupture and preparation for emergency cesarean. Time from rupture to delivery determines neonatal neurological outcome.

2. **Waiting for imaging before taking the patient to the OR.** Ultrasound cannot reliably diagnose or exclude uterine rupture. Hemoperitoneum may be present with minimal free fluid on ultrasound. Clinical diagnosis — hemodynamic instability, fetal bradycardia, loss of station, abnormal uterine contour — is sufficient to proceed to laparotomy without imaging.

3. **Underestimating blood loss because vaginal bleeding is minimal.** Hemorrhage in uterine rupture is primarily intraperitoneal. External vaginal blood loss may be minimal or absent despite life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Maternal tachycardia in a TOLAC patient with fetal bradycardia is uterine rupture until proven otherwise.

4. **Using prostaglandins for labor induction in a scarred uterus without counseling and monitoring.** Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) in a prior cesarean patient increases uterine rupture risk 3–15-fold versus spontaneous labor. ACOG recommends against misoprostol for induction in patients with prior uterine surgery. If prostaglandins are used, continuous fetal monitoring and OB bedside presence are essential.

5. **Delaying hysterectomy to pursue fertility-sparing repair in an unstable patient.** Attempting uterine repair in a hemodynamically deteriorating patient with exsanguinating hemorrhage delays hemorrhage control and increases mortality. Hysterectomy is life-saving. Make the decision before the patient is in refractory shock.

6. **Missing rupture in an unscarred uterus.** Uterine rupture without prior cesarean is rare but occurs: obstructed labor, fundal trauma, grand multiparity, uterine anomaly, cocaine use. Presenting signs are identical to scarred-uterus rupture but may be attributed to other causes due to the low index of suspicion. Any pregnant patient with acute abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, and fetal compromise requires consideration of uterine rupture regardless of surgical history.

7. **Attributing recurrent late decelerations during TOLAC to normal labor progress rather than impending rupture.** Recurrent variable or late decelerations during a trial of labor after cesarean may represent progressive scar dehiscence evolving toward complete rupture. Unlike abruption, which often presents with a sudden catastrophic deceleration, uterine rupture during TOLAC may manifest as a gradually worsening fetal heart rate pattern before an abrupt terminal bradycardia. A Category II tracing that fails to improve with standard resuscitative measures (position change, IV fluid bolus, oxygen, tocolysis) in a TOLAC patient should prompt immediate preparation for emergency cesarean rather than continued expectant management.
