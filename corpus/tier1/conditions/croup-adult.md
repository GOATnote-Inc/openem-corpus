# Adult Croup (Laryngotracheitis)

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Inspiratory stridor (hallmark)
- Barking/brassy cough
- Hoarseness, voice change
- Preceded by URI prodrome (1-3 days): rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, malaise
- Dyspnea, chest tightness
- Symptoms often worse at night

**Adult-specific features:**
- Rare in adults (< 5% of croup cases) — often underdiagnosed
- Milder than pediatric croup but can cause significant airway compromise
- Consider in any adult with acute stridor and URI prodrome
- Immunocompromised adults at higher risk for severe disease
- Must exclude other causes of adult stridor (epiglottitis, angioedema, tumor)

**Etiology:**
- Parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, 3) — most common
- Influenza A/B, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus
- COVID-19 (emerging association with croup-like illness in adults)
- Bacterial superinfection rare in adults

**Severity assessment:**
- Mild: occasional barking cough, no stridor at rest, no retractions
- Moderate: stridor at rest, mild retractions, no agitation
- Severe: prominent stridor at rest, significant retractions, agitation, cyanosis, decreased air entry

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Assess airway patency | Immediate |
| Dexamethasone | < 30 minutes |
| Nebulized epinephrine (if moderate-severe) | < 15 minutes |
| Prepare for airway management | If severe |

1. **Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IV/IM (max 10 mg)** — single dose; onset 2-6 hours; reduces subglottic edema
2. **Nebulized racemic epinephrine** for moderate-severe symptoms: 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution in 3 mL NS via nebulizer. Onset within 10-30 minutes, duration 1-2 hours. Alternative: L-epinephrine 5 mL of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) via nebulizer.
3. **Observe minimum 2-3 hours** after nebulized epinephrine — rebound worsening possible
4. **Humidified O2** — supplemental if hypoxic
5. **Heliox (70:30 helium-oxygen)** — consider for moderate-severe croup not responding to epinephrine; reduces turbulent flow
6. **Avoid agitating the patient** — crying and agitation worsen dynamic airway obstruction
7. **Prepare for intubation** in severe cases — use ETT 0.5-1 size smaller than predicted due to subglottic swelling

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Epiglottitis** — more toxic-appearing, drooling, "hot potato" voice, rapid progression; thumb sign on lateral neck XR
- **Bacterial tracheitis** — high fever, toxic appearance, fails to respond to croup treatment; purulent secretions
- **Angioedema** — lip/tongue/uvula swelling; no viral prodrome
- **Foreign body** — sudden onset without URI prodrome; unilateral findings
- **Peritonsillar/retropharyngeal abscess** — trismus, unilateral swelling, neck stiffness
- **Vocal cord dysfunction** — inspiratory stridor, often triggered by exercise or stress; normal between episodes
- **Laryngeal tumor** — progressive stridor, weight loss, hoarseness; no viral prodrome

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — imaging often unnecessary if classic presentation
- **Neck X-ray (AP):** Steeple sign (subglottic narrowing) — sensitivity ~50%; absence does not exclude croup
- **Lateral neck X-ray:** Rule out epiglottitis (thumb sign), retropharyngeal abscess
- **Flexible nasopharyngoscopy:** If diagnosis uncertain — visualize subglottic edema; rule out epiglottitis or other pathology
- **Labs:** Generally not needed; CBC if bacterial superinfection suspected
- **Pulse oximetry:** Continuous monitoring if moderate-severe
- **Respiratory viral panel:** If etiology needed for isolation decisions

## Treatment

### Mild Croup
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO (max 10 mg) single dose
- Supportive care: hydration, rest, humidified air
- Discharge after observation if improving

### Moderate Croup
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IV/IM (max 10 mg)
- Nebulized racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% in 3 mL NS
- May repeat epinephrine q15-20 min for severe symptoms (maximum 3 doses)
- Observe 2-3 hours post-last epinephrine dose
- If symptoms recur after epinephrine wears off: admit for observation

### Severe Croup
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg IV (max 10 mg)
- Nebulized racemic epinephrine (repeat as needed)
- Heliox (70:30) — reduces work of breathing in severe obstruction
- ICU admission for close airway monitoring
- Intubation if progressive respiratory failure (use smaller ETT)

### Adjunctive
- Budesonide 2 mg nebulized — alternative to systemic dexamethasone if unable to take PO/IV
- Avoid sedation (masks signs of deterioration)
- Avoid cough suppressants

## Disposition

- **ICU admission:** Severe stridor at rest, requiring repeated nebulized epinephrine, impending respiratory failure
- **Observation/admission:** Moderate croup requiring epinephrine that recurs after observation period
- **Discharge:** Mild croup after dexamethasone, no stridor at rest, tolerating PO, reliable follow-up
- **Return precautions:** Increased work of breathing, stridor at rest, inability to drink, drooling, high fever (concern for bacterial superinfection)
- **Minimum observation after epinephrine:** 2-3 hours without recurrence of symptoms

## Pitfalls

1. **Not considering croup in adults with acute stridor.** Croup is almost exclusively diagnosed in children, but it occurs in adults and is often misdiagnosed as asthma, bronchitis, or URI. Adult with inspiratory stridor + barking cough + URI prodrome = croup until proven otherwise.

2. **Discharging within 2 hours of nebulized epinephrine.** Epinephrine's effect is temporary (1-2 hours), and symptoms can rebound. Minimum observation of 2-3 hours post-last dose is required. Premature discharge risks airway deterioration at home.

3. **Failing to exclude epiglottitis in an adult with stridor.** Epiglottitis in adults is more common than croup and more dangerous. Drooling, toxic appearance, severe sore throat, and rapid progression favor epiglottitis. Flexible nasopharyngoscopy or lateral neck X-ray can differentiate.

4. **Omitting dexamethasone because "it's just a virus."** A single dose of dexamethasone significantly reduces symptom severity, ED revisits, and need for intubation. It is the most impactful intervention in croup management and should be given to all patients with confirmed croup, regardless of severity.
