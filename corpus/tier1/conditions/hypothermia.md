# Hypothermia

## Recognition

**Definition:** Core body temperature < 35°C (95°F). Classified by severity:
- **Mild:** 32-35°C (90-95°F) — shivering, tachycardia, vasoconstriction, confusion
- **Moderate:** 28-32°C (82-90°F) — loss of shivering, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, decreased consciousness, paradoxical undressing
- **Severe:** < 28°C (82°F) — absent shivering, coma, ventricular fibrillation/asystole, fixed dilated pupils, apparent death

**Risk Factors:**
- Environmental cold exposure (immersion, outdoor exposure, urban homelessness)
- Alcohol and drug intoxication (impaired thermoregulation, vasodilation, behavioral impairment)
- Extremes of age (neonates, elderly)
- Endocrine: hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypoglycemia
- Neurologic: spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury
- Sepsis
- Burns
- Dermatologic conditions (psoriasis, erythroderma)

**Presentation:**
- Mild: shivering, tachycardia, tachypnea, confusion, poor judgment, dysarthria
- Moderate: cessation of shivering, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness progressing to stupor, atrial dysrhythmias, J (Osborn) waves on ECG
- Severe: coma, areflexia, fixed dilated pupils, ventricular fibrillation, asystole, apnea, undetectable pulse

**Key Point:** Core temperature measurement requires esophageal, bladder, or rectal probe. Oral and tympanic thermometers are unreliable below 35°C. Standard thermometers may not read below 34°C — use a low-reading thermometer.

## Critical Actions

1. **Measure core temperature** — esophageal probe (gold standard in intubated patients) or rectal/bladder probe. Standard oral thermometers cannot read below 34°C.
2. **Handle gently** — rough movement triggers ventricular fibrillation in moderate/severe hypothermia. Minimize jostling, log-roll, cut off wet clothing.
3. **Remove wet clothing** — replace with dry insulation, vapor barrier.
4. **Begin active rewarming** immediately, method based on severity.
5. **Warm IV fluids** — normal saline 40-42°C via fluid warmer for all moderate/severe cases.
6. **Cardiac monitoring** — continuous; anticipate dysrhythmias. Avoid unnecessary invasive procedures until rewarming in progress.
7. **Check glucose** — hypoglycemia is common and exacerbates hypothermia. Dextrose 50% 50 mL IV if hypoglycemic.
8. **Withhold death declaration** until rewarmed to ≥ 32°C — "No one is dead until warm and dead." Exception: obvious lethal injuries, chest wall incompressible for CPR, avalanche burial > 60 min with packed airway and asystole.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Hypothyroidism/myxedema coma | History of thyroid disease, elevated TSH, hyponatremia, delayed relaxation of reflexes |
| Sepsis with hypothermia | Fever may be absent in elderly/immunocompromised; source of infection identified, elevated lactate, WBC abnormalities |
| Hypoglycemia | Rapid glucose check diagnostic; diaphoresis, tremor, altered mental status |
| Drug/alcohol intoxication | May coexist with hypothermia; toxicology screen, osmolar gap |
| Stroke/CNS event | Focal neurologic deficits, CT findings |
| Adrenal crisis | Hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, history of steroid use |
| DKA | Kussmaul respirations, glucose > 250, anion gap acidosis |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- Core temperature (continuous monitoring)
- Point-of-care glucose
- CBC
- BMP (potassium critical — hyperkalemia indicates poor prognosis and cellular death; K+ > 12 mEq/L associated with non-survivable injury)
- Coagulation studies (coagulopathy common; will not correct until rewarmed)
- Lactate
- ABG/VBG (do not temperature-correct; use alpha-stat management)
- Lipase (pancreatitis occurs with rewarming)
- TSH, cortisol (if endocrine etiology suspected)
- Troponin
- Ethanol, toxicology screen
- Blood cultures (if sepsis suspected)

**ECG:**
- J (Osborn) waves: pathognomonic but not always present; positive deflection at J-point, most prominent in leads II and V5-V6
- Progressive changes with decreasing temperature: sinus tachycardia → sinus bradycardia → atrial fibrillation → ventricular fibrillation → asystole
- Prolonged PR, QRS, QTc intervals
- ST changes mimicking ACS

**Imaging:**
- Chest X-ray (aspiration, pulmonary edema)
- CT head if trauma suspected or unclear etiology

## Treatment

**Mild Hypothermia (32-35°C):**
- Passive external rewarming: warm environment (≥ 28°C), remove wet clothing, dry insulation, warm blankets
- Active external rewarming: forced warm air (Bair Hugger), warm packs to axillae/groin/neck (avoid direct skin contact — use barrier)
- Warm oral fluids if alert with intact gag reflex
- Target rewarming rate: 0.5-2°C/hour

**Moderate Hypothermia (28-32°C):**
- Active external rewarming as above
- Warm IV normal saline 40-42°C via fluid warmer, bolus 250-500 mL
- Active internal rewarming if not responding: warm humidified oxygen 40-42°C via heated ventilator circuit
- Bladder irrigation with warm saline 40-42°C
- Handle gently — VF threshold is low

**Severe Hypothermia (< 28°C):**
- Active external + internal rewarming
- If cardiac arrest: CPR, ACLS with modifications
  - Limit defibrillation to 3 attempts if core temp < 30°C; reattempt after rewarming above 30°C
  - Withhold IV vasopressors (epinephrine) until core temp > 30°C (AHA); if > 30°C, increase interval between doses (double to q6-10 min)
  - Continue CPR — prolonged resuscitation is appropriate
- **ECMO/cardiopulmonary bypass:** definitive rewarming for severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest. Rewarming rate 7-10°C/hour. Transfer to ECMO-capable center if feasible with ongoing CPR.
- Thoracic lavage: 40-42°C normal saline via bilateral chest tubes if ECMO unavailable — rewarming rate 3°C/hour
- Peritoneal lavage: 40-42°C normal saline 20 mL/kg via peritoneal catheter

**Adjunctive:**
- Thiamine 100 mg IV (chronic alcohol use, malnourishment)
- Dextrose 50% 50 mL IV if hypoglycemic
- Magnesium 2 g IV if hypomagnesemic (reduces VF threshold)
- Treat hyperkalemia aggressively if present: calcium gluconate 10% 30 mL IV, insulin 10 units IV + dextrose 50% 50 mL IV

## Disposition

**ICU Admission:**
- Moderate or severe hypothermia (core temp < 32°C)
- Cardiac arrest, dysrhythmias
- Hemodynamic instability
- Requiring active internal rewarming
- Coagulopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or significant electrolyte derangements

**Transfer to ECMO Center:**
- Severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest or refractory hemodynamic instability
- Contact early — transport time is critical

**Floor/Observation Admission:**
- Mild hypothermia with significant comorbidities, recurrent exposure risk, or unclear etiology

**Discharge:**
- Mild hypothermia, successfully rewarmed to ≥ 36°C, observed ≥ 4 hours, normal ECG, normal labs, reliable social situation, no ongoing exposure risk

## Pitfalls

1. **Using standard oral thermometers.** Standard clinical thermometers do not read below 34°C. Hypothermia is missed when not specifically measured with low-reading or continuous core temperature probes (esophageal, rectal, bladder).

2. **Declaring death before rewarming.** Hypothermic patients can appear dead with fixed dilated pupils, absent pulses, and asystole — yet achieve full neurologic recovery after rewarming. Resuscitate until core temp ≥ 32°C unless obviously incompatible-with-life injuries or potassium > 12 mEq/L.

3. **Rough handling.** The cold myocardium is exquisitely sensitive to mechanical and electrical stimulation. Aggressive movement, central line placement, or rough handling can precipitate ventricular fibrillation. Log-roll, cut off clothing, minimize interventions until rewarming is underway.

4. **Repeated defibrillation below 30°C.** The hypothermic myocardium is refractory to defibrillation. Limit to 3 attempts below 30°C, then focus on rewarming. Reattempt defibrillation once core temp exceeds 30°C.

5. **Overcorrecting temperature too fast (afterdrop).** Core temperature continues to drop during initial rewarming as cold peripheral blood returns to the core (afterdrop phenomenon). Anticipate a 1-2°C further decline and prepare for arrhythmias during this period.

6. **Ignoring coexisting conditions.** Hypothermia commonly occurs alongside trauma, intoxication, sepsis, or endocrine emergencies. Treating only the temperature and missing a subdural hematoma, diabetic ketoacidosis, or occult hemorrhage is a lethal error.

7. **Forgetting to check potassium.** Serum potassium is the single best prognostic marker in hypothermic cardiac arrest. K+ > 12 mEq/L indicates irreversible cellular death and non-survivability. Check early to guide resuscitation intensity and family counseling.

8. **Administering full-dose vasopressors in severe hypothermia.** Medications accumulate in the hypothermic state due to reduced hepatic metabolism and peripheral vasoconstriction. Withhold epinephrine until core temp > 30°C. Above 30°C, extend dosing intervals. Bolus stacking causes rebound toxicity during rewarming.

9. **Failing to warm IV fluids.** Room-temperature crystalloid infusion drops core temperature further. All IV fluids must be warmed to 40-42°C via in-line fluid warmer.
