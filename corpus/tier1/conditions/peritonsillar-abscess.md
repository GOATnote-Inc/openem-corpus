# Peritonsillar Abscess

## Recognition

**Definition:** Collection of pus between the tonsillar capsule and the superior constrictor muscle, most commonly at the superior pole. The most common deep space head and neck infection. Peak incidence: 20-40 years.

**Clinical Features:**
- Severe unilateral sore throat (progressive over 3-5 days, often worsening despite antibiotics for pharyngitis)
- Trismus (limited mouth opening due to pterygoid muscle inflammation) — present in 50-70%
- "Hot potato" voice (muffled, hypernasal)
- Odynophagia with drooling (unable to swallow secretions)
- Referred otalgia (ipsilateral)
- Fever (38-40°C)

**Exam Findings:**
- Unilateral peritonsillar bulging with fluctuance
- Contralateral deviation of uvula
- Erythematous, edematous soft palate
- Tonsillar exudate (may be absent)
- Anterior cervical lymphadenopathy (ipsilateral)
- Trismus limiting exam

**Microbiology:**
- Polymicrobial in most cases
- Group A Streptococcus (GAS), Fusobacterium necrophorum (anaerobe implicated in Lemierre syndrome), Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess airway** — stridor, tripod positioning, inability to handle secretions, or bilateral peritonsillar swelling warrant immediate airway intervention. Most PTA patients have a stable airway.
2. **Pain control** — acetaminophen 1000 mg IV + ketorolac 15-30 mg IV. Viscous lidocaine 2% gargle or topical cetacaine spray for oropharyngeal anesthesia pre-procedure.
3. **Needle aspiration or incision and drainage** — the definitive ED procedure. Needle aspiration is first-line (equivalent efficacy to I&D, less pain). Aspiration of purulent material confirms diagnosis.
4. **Antibiotics** — amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID x 10 days. If severe/toxic: ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h. Add metronidazole 500 mg PO TID if high concern for anaerobic involvement.
5. **IV fluids** — rehydrate patients who have been unable to swallow for days.
6. **Dexamethasone 10 mg IV single dose** — reduces edema, pain, and trismus. Hastens symptom resolution.
7. **Reassess after drainage** — patient should have significant improvement in pain, trismus, and swallowing within 30-60 minutes.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Peritonsillar cellulitis (phlegmon) | Unilateral swelling without discrete fluctuant collection; CT or ultrasound shows no drainable abscess; treat with antibiotics alone initially |
| Retropharyngeal abscess | Posterior pharyngeal wall bulging, neck stiffness, torticollis; more common in children < 5; CT with contrast shows retropharyngeal collection |
| Parapharyngeal abscess | Medial displacement of tonsil/lateral pharyngeal wall, neck swelling; CT shows parapharyngeal space collection; requires operative drainage |
| Epiglottitis | Dysphagia, drooling, muffled voice; but no peritonsillar bulging. Lateral soft tissue neck X-ray shows "thumbprint" sign. |
| Ludwig angina | Bilateral submandibular swelling, floor-of-mouth elevation, airway emergency |
| Infectious mononucleosis | Bilateral tonsillar enlargement, posterior cervical LAD, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytes, positive heterophile/monospot |
| Tonsillar malignancy (lymphoma, SCC) | Unilateral tonsillar enlargement, chronic course, weight loss, no fever; biopsy required |
| Dental abscess (molar) | Dental tenderness, gingival swelling, trismus; periapical abscess on panoramic X-ray |

## Workup

**Bedside:**
- Intraoral ultrasound (endocavitary or hockey-stick probe) — differentiates abscess from cellulitis with sensitivity 89-95%. Identifies fluid collection depth and safe aspiration trajectory.
- Point-of-care ultrasound is the preferred first-line imaging modality in PTA

**Labs:**
- CBC — leukocytosis
- BMP — dehydration assessment
- Monospot/heterophile antibody — if bilateral tonsillar enlargement, posterior LAD, or young adult with atypical features (rule out mononucleosis before drainage)
- Blood cultures — only if systemically septic
- Abscess culture (aerobic and anaerobic) — guide antibiotic narrowing

**Imaging (if diagnosis uncertain or deep space extension suspected):**
- CT neck with IV contrast — gold standard for deep space infections. Obtain if: failed aspiration, suspected parapharyngeal/retropharyngeal extension, trismus preventing adequate exam, recurrent PTA.
- Lateral soft tissue neck X-ray — limited utility but can show retropharyngeal widening if concerned about retropharyngeal abscess

## Treatment

**Drainage (same-visit, performed by emergency physician):**

*Needle Aspiration (first-line):*
- Topical anesthesia: cetacaine spray + local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine
- 18-gauge needle on 10 mL syringe
- Aspirate at the point of maximal fluctuance (typically superior pole)
- Limit needle depth to 1 cm (avoid carotid artery — 2.5 cm posterolateral to tonsil)
- Aspirate in 3 locations if initial aspiration is dry (superior pole, middle, inferior pole)
- 90-95% success rate with single aspiration

*Incision and Drainage:*
- If needle aspiration non-diagnostic or abscess recurs
- #11 blade guarded with tape to 1 cm depth
- Incise at point of maximal fluctuance, spread with hemostat
- Suction drainage

**Antibiotics:**
- Outpatient: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID x 10 days
- Penicillin allergy: clindamycin 300 mg PO QID x 10 days
- Inpatient (if admitted): ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h OR clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h

**Adjuncts:**
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV x 1 — reduces pain, trismus, and time to symptom resolution
- Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h + ibuprofen 400-600 mg PO q6h (alternating)
- IV fluid rehydration
- Medicated gargles: warm saline, chlorhexidine 0.12%

## Disposition

**Discharge (most PTA patients):**
- Successful drainage with symptomatic improvement
- Tolerating oral fluids and medications
- No airway compromise
- Reliable follow-up within 24-48 hours (ENT or ED recheck)
- Prescriptions: antibiotics x 10 days, pain control, oral chlorhexidine rinse
- Return precautions: worsening swelling, difficulty breathing, inability to swallow, fever > 38.5°C

**Admit:**
- Airway compromise or concern for impending airway obstruction
- Inability to tolerate oral medications/fluids despite drainage
- Deep space extension (parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal)
- Failed aspiration requiring operative I&D under general anesthesia
- Immunocompromised patient
- Sepsis
- Suspected Lemierre syndrome (septic thrombophlebitis of internal jugular vein — high fever, rigors, neck pain/swelling, positive blood cultures for Fusobacterium)

**ENT Referral:**
- All PTA patients should have ENT follow-up
- Recurrent PTA (>= 2 episodes) — discuss interval tonsillectomy

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing severe unilateral sore throat to pharyngitis without examining the oropharynx.** PTA is missed when the provider does not examine the palate and tonsils. Trismus makes the exam difficult — use topical anesthesia and gentle technique.

2. **Not draining the abscess.** Antibiotics alone have a 20-25% failure rate. Drainage is the definitive treatment and provides immediate symptom relief. Emergency physicians should perform needle aspiration routinely.

3. **Failing to send abscess cultures.** Fusobacterium necrophorum is increasingly recognized as a PTA pathogen and predisposes to Lemierre syndrome. Culture results guide antibiotic therapy and identify high-risk organisms.

4. **Missing Lemierre syndrome.** A PTA patient with sepsis, rigors, neck swelling/tenderness along the SCM, or persistent fever despite drainage should be evaluated for internal jugular vein septic thrombophlebitis with CT neck with contrast. Fusobacterium is the classic pathogen. Requires prolonged IV antibiotics and possible anticoagulation.

5. **Not testing for mononucleosis in young adults.** EBV causes massive tonsillar enlargement that can mimic PTA. Incising an EBV-enlarged tonsil causes hemorrhage. Check monospot before drainage if bilateral tonsillar hypertrophy or atypical features are present.

6. **Penetrating the carotid artery during aspiration.** The internal carotid artery lies 2.5 cm posterolateral to the tonsil. Guard needle depth to 1 cm. Always aspirate at the point of maximal fluctuance (superior pole). If bright red pulsatile blood is aspirated, hold pressure and obtain vascular surgery consultation.

7. **Discharging without ensuring oral intake.** Patients who have not eaten or drunk for days are volume-depleted. Ensure adequate PO intake post-procedure before discharge. Patients who cannot tolerate oral intake require admission for IV fluids and IV antibiotics.

8. **Diagnosing PTA without considering parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal abscess.** Patients with neck stiffness, torticollis, or swelling extending below the mandible may have deep space extension requiring CT and operative management — not just bedside aspiration.
