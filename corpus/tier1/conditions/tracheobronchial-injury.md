# Tracheobronchial Injury

## Recognition

**Mechanism:**
- **Blunt:** MVC, clothesline injury, crush injury. Most injuries within 2.5 cm of carina. Right mainstem bronchus most common site.
- **Penetrating:** Stab, GSW to neck or chest. Cervical trachea more commonly injured in penetrating trauma.

**Classic presentation:**
- Massive subcutaneous emphysema (progressive, extending from neck to chest/abdomen)
- Pneumothorax with persistent large air leak despite chest tube (lung fails to re-expand)
- Pneumomediastinum
- Hemoptysis
- Respiratory distress
- Stridor (if cervical tracheal injury)
- "Fallen lung sign" on CXR — lung falls away from hilum toward diaphragm (pathognomonic for complete bronchial transection)

**Key diagnostic clue:** Pneumothorax that does NOT resolve with chest tube placement. Continuous large air leak through the chest tube drainage system.

**Missed in 25-68% of cases at initial presentation** — high index of suspicion required.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Secure airway | Immediate |
| Chest tube if pneumothorax | Immediate |
| CT chest/neck | After airway secured |
| Bronchoscopy | < 2 hours (definitive diagnosis) |
| Thoracic surgery consult | < 1 hour |

1. **Airway management** — the critical first step:
   - If breathing spontaneously, keep patient spontaneously ventilating as long as possible
   - Intubation: advance ETT under direct vision (video laryngoscopy or fiberoptic bronchoscope-guided preferred). May need to advance past the injury site.
   - For distal bronchial injury: selective intubation of uninjured mainstem bronchus
   - Avoid positive pressure ventilation until ETT is beyond injury (can worsen air leak, cause tension pneumothorax)
   - Surgical airway (tracheostomy) if cervical tracheal injury prevents oral intubation
2. **Tube thoracostomy** — 36-40 Fr if pneumothorax present. May need multiple tubes or continuous suction. Persistent air leak is a diagnostic clue, not a treatment failure.
3. **CT chest and neck with IV contrast** — delineates injury location, associated injuries, mediastinal emphysema
4. **Bronchoscopy** — definitive diagnostic study. Rigid or flexible. Identifies location, extent, and type of injury. Usually performed in OR.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Tension pneumothorax (resolves with chest tube; TBI does not)
- Esophageal rupture (mediastinal air, but no air leak through chest tube)
- Laryngeal fracture (more proximal, voice changes prominent)
- Pulmonary laceration with bronchopleural fistula (parenchymal, not central airway)
- Ruptured bullae/blebs (spontaneous pneumothorax, no trauma)
- Pneumomediastinum from other causes (esophageal, alveolar rupture)

## Workup

- **CT chest/neck with IV contrast** — may show: tracheal or bronchial discontinuity, peribronchial air, pneumomediastinum, fallen lung sign, persistent pneumothorax with tube in good position
- **Chest X-ray:** Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, persistent pneumothorax, fallen lung sign, deep cervical emphysema
- **Bronchoscopy (rigid or flexible)** — gold standard for diagnosis. Identifies tear location, extent (partial vs. complete transection), mucosal disruption
- **CT angiography** — if concern for concurrent great vessel injury
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, type and crossmatch, ABG, coagulation studies

## Treatment

**Non-operative management (select cases):**
- Small tears (< 1/3 circumference) without respiratory compromise
- Tears confined to membranous (posterior) trachea
- Patient tolerating spontaneous ventilation
- Management: close observation, antibiotics, serial imaging and bronchoscopy
- Humidified O2, HOB elevation, cough suppression (codeine 15-30 mg PO q4-6h PRN)

**Operative repair (majority of cases):**
- Indications: large tears (> 1/3 circumference), complete transection, persistent air leak, respiratory failure, mediastinitis
- **Cervical trachea:** Anterior cervical approach (collar incision)
- **Distal trachea/carina/mainstem bronchi:** Right posterolateral thoracotomy (4th ICS)
- **Left mainstem bronchus:** Left posterolateral thoracotomy
- Primary repair with interrupted absorbable sutures (3-0 or 4-0 PDS/Vicryl)
- Buttress repair with intercostal muscle flap, pericardial fat, or pleural flap
- Complete transection: resection and end-to-end anastomosis
- Tissue-sparing approach: debride minimally, preserve blood supply

**Airway management pearls:**
- Avoid high-pressure positive ventilation (worsens air leak)
- Consider jet ventilation or independent lung ventilation
- Advance ETT past injury under bronchoscopic guidance
- Double-lumen ETT for independent lung ventilation during repair

**Antibiotics (penetrating injuries):**
- Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h or cefazolin 2 g IV q8h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h

## Disposition

- **ICU:** All confirmed tracheobronchial injuries
- **OR:** Urgent repair for large tears, complete transection, or respiratory failure
- **Thoracic surgery consult:** Mandatory for all cases
- **Interventional pulmonology:** May assist with bronchoscopic diagnosis and management
- **Transfer:** Level I trauma center with thoracic surgery capability

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming persistent air leak after chest tube is a tube malfunction.** Persistent large air leak with failure of lung re-expansion is the hallmark of tracheobronchial injury. Do not reposition or replace the tube without considering this diagnosis.

2. **Positive pressure ventilation before securing ETT past the injury.** PPV can convert a partial tear to complete disruption, force air into mediastinum, and cause tension pneumothorax or cardiac arrest. Keep the patient spontaneously ventilating when possible.

3. **Missing the diagnosis because initial CT was read as "pneumomediastinum."** Pneumomediastinum in the setting of blunt thoracic trauma should prompt bronchoscopy to rule out tracheobronchial injury, not observation.

4. **Delayed diagnosis.** 25-68% of cases are missed initially. Undiagnosed injuries cause bronchial stenosis, recurrent pneumonia, and atelectasis weeks to months later. Any persistent air leak or non-resolving pneumothorax warrants bronchoscopy.

5. **Attempting to manage massive air leak with higher suction pressure on chest tube.** This does not address the underlying injury and may worsen it. The patient needs bronchoscopy and likely surgical repair, not more suction.
