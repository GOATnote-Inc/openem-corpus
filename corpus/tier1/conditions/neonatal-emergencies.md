# Neonatal Emergencies

## Recognition

### The Febrile Neonate (< 28 Days Old)
- **Any fever >= 38.0 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) in a neonate < 28 days is a medical emergency** until proven otherwise
- Neonates are immunocompromised: immature complement, low immunoglobulin, impaired neutrophil function
- Serious bacterial infection (SBI) prevalence: 10-15% in febrile neonates < 28 days
- Pathogens: Group B Streptococcus (GBS), E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, HSV, enterovirus

### Signs of the Sick Neonate
- Fever or hypothermia (< 36.0 degrees C)
- Lethargy, poor feeding, weak cry
- Tachypnea (RR > 60), grunting, nasal flaring, retractions
- Tachycardia (HR > 180) or bradycardia (HR < 100)
- Cyanosis (central — lips, tongue; not just acrocyanosis)
- Mottled or gray skin color
- Bulging fontanelle
- Seizures (subtle: lip smacking, bicycling, apnea; overt: tonic-clonic)
- Capillary refill > 3 seconds
- Abdominal distension, bilious vomiting

### Neonatal HSV — High Index of Suspicion
Three presentations:
1. **Skin-eyes-mouth (SEM):** Vesicular lesions, conjunctivitis, oral ulcers. Best prognosis if treated early.
2. **CNS disease:** Seizures, lethargy, CSF pleocytosis. Mortality 4% with treatment; 50% without.
3. **Disseminated:** Hepatitis, DIC, pneumonitis, shock. Mimics bacterial sepsis. Mortality 30% with treatment.

**Triggers for acyclovir:** Vesicular lesions anywhere, seizures, elevated AST/ALT, CSF pleocytosis with negative Gram stain, maternal HSV history, clinical deterioration on antibiotics

### Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) Presenting in the Neonate
- **Ductal-dependent lesions** present when the ductus arteriosus closes (typically 24-72 hours of life, up to 2 weeks):
  - **Ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow:** Pulmonary atresia, critical pulmonary stenosis, tricuspid atresia, tetralogy of Fallot (severe) — present with cyanosis
  - **Ductal-dependent systemic blood flow:** Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), critical coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch — present with shock, poor femoral pulses, differential cyanosis
  - **Ductal-dependent mixing:** Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) — cyanosis unresponsive to supplemental O2

- **Key finding:** Pre- and post-ductal pulse oximetry difference > 3% suggests ductal-dependent lesion or persistent pulmonary hypertension

### Neonatal Jaundice
- Physiologic jaundice: onset after 24 hours, peaks day 3-5, resolves by 2 weeks
- **Pathologic jaundice red flags:** Onset < 24 hours of life, total bilirubin > 95th percentile for age (use Bhutani nomogram), rate of rise > 0.2 mg/dL/hr, conjugated (direct) bilirubin > 1 mg/dL or > 20% of total
- **Kernicterus risk:** Total bilirubin > 25 mg/dL (term infant); lower thresholds for preterm, hemolysis, sepsis

### ALTE/BRUE (Brief Resolved Unexplained Event)
BRUE criteria (replaces ALTE): Episode in infant < 1 year with >= 1 of:
- Cyanosis or pallor
- Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing
- Marked change in tone (hyper- or hypotonia)
- Altered level of responsiveness

**Lower risk BRUE:** Age > 60 days, gestational age >= 32 weeks, first event, duration < 1 minute, no CPR by trained medical provider required. Higher risk = does not meet all low-risk criteria.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Rectal temperature | On arrival (most accurate in neonates) |
| Point-of-care glucose | Within 5 minutes |
| IV access | Within 15 minutes |
| Blood/urine/CSF cultures | Within 30 minutes |
| Empiric antibiotics + acyclovir | Within 1 hour of recognition |
| PGE1 for suspected ductal-dependent CHD | Immediately upon recognition |

1. Obtain rectal temperature. Confirm fever >= 38.0 degrees C.
2. Check point-of-care glucose immediately. Treat hypoglycemia (< 45 mg/dL) with D10W 2 mL/kg IV push.
3. Establish IV access. If unable, obtain IO access (proximal tibia, 18G IO needle).
4. Obtain full sepsis workup: blood culture, CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis with urine culture (catheterized specimen), lumbar puncture (CSF cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture, HSV PCR), blood gas, lactate.
5. Send HSV PCR (blood and CSF), LFTs (AST, ALT as markers of disseminated HSV).
6. Administer empiric antibiotics within 1 hour: ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV + gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV (or cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV if available, in place of gentamicin).
7. Add acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h if any HSV concern (vesicles, seizures, LFT elevation, CSF pleocytosis, maternal HSV history, ill-appearing without clear bacterial source).
8. If cyanosis unresponsive to supplemental O2 or signs of obstructive shock: start prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min IV. Prepare for apnea (have bag-valve-mask at bedside, prepare for intubation).

## Differential Diagnosis

### Febrile Neonate
- **Bacterial sepsis/meningitis:** GBS, E. coli, Listeria, Klebsiella
- **Neonatal HSV:** SEM, CNS, or disseminated
- **Urinary tract infection:** Most common focal bacterial infection in febrile neonates
- **Viral illness:** Enterovirus, parechovirus (can cause meningoencephalitis), RSV, influenza
- **Pneumonia:** Tachypnea, grunting, hypoxia
- **Congenital syphilis:** Rash, hepatosplenomegaly, snuffles, periostitis

### Cyanotic Neonate
- **Ductal-dependent CHD** (see Recognition)
- **Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN)**
- **Pneumonia/sepsis**
- **Pneumothorax** (especially after resuscitation)
- **Congenital diaphragmatic hernia:** Scaphoid abdomen, absent breath sounds, bowel sounds in chest
- **Methemoglobinemia** (rare; co-oximetry)

### Neonatal Shock
- **Septic shock:** Most common
- **Cardiogenic:** CHD (HLHS, critical coarctation), myocarditis
- **Obstructive:** Tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, ductal-dependent lesion
- **Hypovolemic:** Birth trauma, intraventricular hemorrhage, adrenal hemorrhage
- **Inborn errors of metabolism:** Hyperammonemia, organic acidemias (check ammonia, lactate, newborn screen)

## Workup

### Full Sepsis Workup (Mandatory for All Febrile Neonates < 28 Days)
- **Blood culture:** At least 1 mL in aerobic bottle; do not delay antibiotics for second set
- **CBC with differential:** WBC < 5,000 or > 20,000, bands > 10%, I:T ratio > 0.2, thrombocytopenia
- **CMP:** Glucose, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, calcium
- **Blood gas (venous or capillary):** Metabolic acidosis in sepsis/shock
- **Lactate:** Elevated (> 2 mmol/L) in sepsis and shock
- **CRP:** Useful for risk stratification; < 20 mg/L in conjunction with normal UA and ANC > 4,000 lowers SBI probability (per 2021 AAP guideline)
- **Procalcitonin:** < 0.5 ng/mL adds negative predictive value; caveat: physiologically elevated at birth, normalizes by 72 hours of life
- **Urinalysis and urine culture:** Catheterized specimen mandatory (bag specimens have unacceptable contamination rates). Positive UA: LE positive, > 5 WBC/HPF, nitrites, bacteria
- **Lumbar puncture:** CSF cell count, glucose, protein, Gram stain, culture, HSV PCR, enterovirus PCR. Do NOT delay antibiotics if LP delayed or unsuccessful; perform LP when stable.
- **HSV studies:** HSV PCR on blood and CSF; surface swabs (conjunctivae, oropharynx, rectum) for HSV culture; AST/ALT (disseminated HSV causes hepatitis)

### Additional Studies as Indicated
- **Chest X-ray:** Tachypnea, hypoxia, respiratory distress
- **Ammonia level:** If unexplained encephalopathy, seizures, or metabolic acidosis (inborn errors of metabolism)
- **Newborn screening results:** Review if available; may reveal metabolic or endocrine disorders
- **Pre- and post-ductal pulse oximetry:** Right hand (pre-ductal) and either foot (post-ductal); difference > 3% suggests ductal-dependent lesion or PPHN
- **Echocardiography:** If CHD suspected (cyanosis, murmur, shock without clear infectious source)
- **Total and direct bilirubin:** If jaundiced; plot on Bhutani nomogram

## Treatment

### Empiric Antibiotics for Neonatal Sepsis
**First-line (< 28 days):**
- Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV q8h (covers GBS, Listeria, enterococcus) PLUS
- Gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV q24h (synergy with ampicillin for GBS; Gram-negative coverage)

**Alternative (when gentamicin unavailable or contraindicated):**
- Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV q8h PLUS
- Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV q8h (broader Gram-negative coverage; note: ceftriaxone is CONTRAINDICATED in neonates due to bilirubin displacement and calcium-ceftriaxone precipitation)

**If concern for meningitis doses:**
- Ampicillin 75 mg/kg IV q8h (meningitis dosing)
- Gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV q24h

### Acyclovir for Neonatal HSV
- **Acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h** (high dose — not the adult 10 mg/kg dose)
- Duration: 14 days for SEM disease; 21 days for CNS or disseminated disease
- Start empirically if ANY of: vesicular lesions, seizures, CSF pleocytosis with negative Gram stain, elevated AST/ALT, maternal HSV history, clinical deterioration on antibiotics, no clear bacterial source and ill-appearing
- Maintain adequate hydration during acyclovir (crystalloid 1.5x maintenance) to prevent nephrotoxicity
- Monitor renal function (BUN/Cr) and CBC (neutropenia)

### Ductal-Dependent CHD — Prostaglandin E1
- **Alprostadil (PGE1) 0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min IV continuous infusion**
- Start at 0.05 mcg/kg/min; increase to 0.1 mcg/kg/min if no clinical response in 15-30 minutes
- Once ductus reopens, reduce to 0.01-0.03 mcg/kg/min for maintenance
- **Apnea occurs in 10-12%:** Have bag-valve-mask at bedside, prepare for endotracheal intubation (3.0 uncuffed ETT for term neonate, 2.5 for preterm)
- Other side effects: hypotension, fever, flushing, bradycardia
- Do NOT withhold supplemental O2 while awaiting PGE1; cyanosis kills faster than the theoretical concern of closing the ductus

### Neonatal Hypoglycemia
- **Definition:** Blood glucose < 45 mg/dL in a symptomatic neonate
- **Treatment:** D10W 2 mL/kg IV bolus (provides 200 mg/kg dextrose). Do NOT use D50W (hyperosmolar, causes sclerosis of peripheral veins and rebound hypoglycemia)
- Follow with D10W continuous infusion at glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 6-8 mg/kg/min
- Recheck glucose in 15-30 minutes; repeat bolus if still < 45 mg/dL
- If refractory to D10W: hydrocortisone 5 mg/kg IV or glucagon 0.03 mg/kg IV/IM (max 1 mg)

### Neonatal Jaundice / Kernicterus Prevention
- Plot total serum bilirubin on Bhutani nomogram for risk zone
- **Phototherapy:** Initiate per AAP 2022 thresholds based on gestational age, postnatal age, and neurotoxicity risk factors
- **Exchange transfusion:** If total bilirubin approaches exchange threshold (typically > 25 mg/dL in term infant, lower if risk factors), rising despite intensive phototherapy, or signs of acute bilirubin encephalopathy (hypertonia, retrocollis, opisthotonus, fever, high-pitched cry)
- Ensure adequate hydration; supplemental feeding q2-3h

### ALTE/BRUE
- **Lower risk BRUE:** Brief period of observation (1-4 hours), educate caregivers on CPR, no further workup required per AAP guidelines
- **Higher risk BRUE:** Admit for monitoring; workup based on clinical features (ECG, pertussis testing, glucose, lactate, consider EEG, echocardiography, neuroimaging)

### Resuscitation Targets in Neonatal Shock
- **Heart rate:** 120-160 bpm
- **MAP:** Gestational age in weeks (approximation; e.g., 40 mmHg for 40-week neonate)
- **Urine output:** 1-2 mL/kg/hr
- **Lactate trending down**
- **Fluid resuscitation:** Normal saline 10 mL/kg IV bolus over 10-20 minutes (NOT 20 mL/kg as in older pediatrics; neonates are sensitive to volume overload). Reassess after each bolus. Max 40-60 mL/kg in first hour.
- **Vasopressors if fluid-refractory:** Epinephrine 0.05-0.3 mcg/kg/min IV or dopamine 5-20 mcg/kg/min IV
- **Stress-dose hydrocortisone:** 1-2 mg/kg IV if vasopressor-refractory shock (adrenal insufficiency common in sick neonates)

## Disposition

- **All febrile neonates < 28 days require admission** for parenteral antibiotics pending culture results (minimum 36-48 hours for cultures)
- **NICU admission:** Ill-appearing, hemodynamic instability, seizures, respiratory distress requiring support, suspected HSV, ductal-dependent CHD, exchange transfusion
- **Monitored pediatric bed:** Well-appearing febrile neonate with reassuring labs (normal UA, ANC > 4,000, procalcitonin < 0.5, CRP < 20), pending cultures on empiric antibiotics
- **Neonatal CHD:** Stabilize with PGE1 and transfer to a pediatric cardiac surgery center. Contact accepting facility and neonatal/pediatric transport team immediately.
- **BRUE — lower risk:** May discharge after observation period with strict return precautions and outpatient follow-up within 24 hours. Educate caregivers on infant CPR.
- **BRUE — higher risk:** Admit for cardiorespiratory monitoring and evaluation.
- **No febrile neonate < 28 days should be discharged from the ED.** Period.

## Pitfalls

1. **Discharging a febrile neonate < 28 days.** No risk stratification tool reliably excludes serious bacterial infection in this age group. All febrile neonates < 28 days require full sepsis workup, empiric antibiotics, and admission.

2. **Not adding acyclovir when HSV is possible.** Neonatal HSV is rapidly fatal without treatment. Any febrile or ill-appearing neonate with vesicles, seizures, elevated LFTs, or CSF pleocytosis needs acyclovir 20 mg/kg IV q8h. Do not wait for PCR results.

3. **Using ceftriaxone in neonates.** Ceftriaxone displaces bilirubin from albumin (kernicterus risk) and forms calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates (fatal in neonates receiving calcium-containing IV fluids). Use cefotaxime instead.

4. **Using D50W for neonatal hypoglycemia.** D50W is hyperosmolar, scleroses peripheral veins, and causes rebound hypoglycemia. Use D10W 2 mL/kg IV bolus.

5. **Failing to check pre- and post-ductal pulse oximetry.** A saturation difference > 3% between the right hand and either foot suggests a ductal-dependent lesion or PPHN. This takes 30 seconds and can be life-saving.

6. **Withholding PGE1 because of apnea risk.** Apnea occurs in 10-12% but is manageable with bag-valve-mask or intubation. Ductal closure in a ductal-dependent lesion is immediately fatal. Start PGE1 and prepare airway equipment.

7. **Relying on WBC alone for risk stratification.** WBC in the first 28 days of life is an unreliable marker. Use the combination of CRP, procalcitonin, ANC, and UA as per AAP 2021 guidelines, and still treat empirically.

8. **Performing bag urine collection.** Bag specimens have contamination rates of 50-60%. Only catheterized or suprapubic aspirate urine specimens are acceptable in neonates.

9. **Not preparing for intubation when starting PGE1.** Have all airway equipment at bedside before infusion: appropriately sized ETT (3.0 uncuffed for term), laryngoscope with Miller 0 or 1 blade, bag-valve-mask with infant mask, suction.

10. **Forgetting inborn errors of metabolism.** A septic-appearing neonate with negative cultures, refractory metabolic acidosis, hyperammonemia, or unusual odor may have an inborn error of metabolism. Check ammonia, lactate, pyruvate, urine organic acids, and plasma amino acids.
