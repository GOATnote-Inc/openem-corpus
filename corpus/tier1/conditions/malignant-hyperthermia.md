# Malignant Hyperthermia

## Recognition

**Triggering agents:**
- Volatile inhalational anesthetics: sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, halothane, enflurane
- Depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: succinylcholine
- NOT triggered by: nitrous oxide, propofol, ketamine, etomidate, benzodiazepines, opioids, non-depolarizing NMBs (rocuronium, vecuronium)

**Earliest signs (often occur before temperature rise):**
- Unexplained rise in end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) despite increased minute ventilation (most sensitive early sign)
- Masseter muscle spasm/rigidity after succinylcholine (occurs in up to 1% of pediatric patients given succinylcholine; 15-30% of these are MH-susceptible)
- Unexplained tachycardia, tachypnea
- Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis

**Progressing signs:**
- Generalized skeletal muscle rigidity ("board-like")
- Hyperthermia: temperature rises 1-2C every 5 minutes, reaching >40C (104F); temperature rise is often a LATE sign
- Skin mottling, diaphoresis
- Tachyarrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation)
- Dark-colored urine (myoglobinuria from rhabdomyolysis)
- Unstable blood pressure

**Laboratory findings:**
- Hyperkalemia (from rhabdomyolysis and acidosis)
- Elevated CK (creatine kinase >10,000 IU/L, may exceed 100,000)
- Myoglobinuria
- Metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2, base excess < -8)
- Elevated lactate
- DIC (elevated PT/INR, PTT, D-dimer, decreased fibrinogen, thrombocytopenia)

**ED relevance:**
- Post-RSI in ED with succinylcholine (onset within minutes)
- Transfer from OR/ambulatory surgery center
- Recrudescence (recurrence 12-24 hours after initial treatment in up to 25% of cases)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Stop triggering agent | Immediately |
| Administer dantrolene | < 10 minutes from recognition |
| Call for help and MH hotline | Immediately |

1. **Stop all triggering agents immediately.** Discontinue volatile anesthetics, remove vaporizers from circuit. If post-RSI in ED: succinylcholine is already metabolized, but if volatile agent running, stop it
2. **Hyperventilate with 100% FiO2** at 2-3x normal minute ventilation using a clean anesthesia circuit or Ambu bag (do not use anesthesia machine that had volatile agent running through it)
3. **Dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV bolus** — reconstitute with sterile water (each 20 mg vial requires 60 mL sterile water; Ryanodex formulation: 250 mg/vial requires 5 mL). Repeat 2.5 mg/kg q5 minutes until symptoms resolve (tachycardia, rigidity, ETCO2 normalize). No maximum dose in a true MH crisis — continue until symptoms resolve
4. **Active cooling:** Ice packs to axillae, groin, neck; cold IV saline 1-2 L; cooling blankets; cold lavage (gastric, bladder, peritoneal if refractory). Target temperature < 38.5C, then stop active cooling to avoid overshoot hypothermia
5. **Treat hyperkalemia:** Calcium chloride 10 mg/kg IV (or calcium gluconate 30 mg/kg IV), regular insulin 0.1 units/kg IV + dextrose 0.5 g/kg IV (D50W), sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg IV
6. **Call MH hotline: 1-800-644-9737** (MHAUS 24/7 emergency consultation)
7. **Continuous core temperature monitoring** (esophageal, rectal, or bladder probe — not axillary or tympanic)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Serotonin syndrome (medication history: SSRIs + MAOIs, clonus prominent, no ETCO2 rise)
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (antipsychotic exposure, develops over days not minutes, "lead-pipe" rigidity)
- Thyroid storm (known thyroid disease, goiter, exophthalmos, no triggering agent exposure)
- Sepsis (infectious source, develops over hours, no muscle rigidity)
- Pheochromocytoma crisis (episodic hypertension, headache, diaphoresis)
- Drug-induced hyperthermia: sympathomimetics (cocaine, amphetamines), anticholinergic toxicity, MDMA
- Heatstroke (environmental exposure, no triggering agent)
- Succinylcholine-induced masseter spasm without MH (isolated masseter spasm resolves spontaneously; if generalized rigidity develops, treat as MH)

## Workup

- **Continuous ETCO2 monitoring:** Most sensitive early indicator; rising ETCO2 despite adequate ventilation
- **Core temperature monitoring:** Esophageal or rectal probe (continuous)
- **ABG/VBG:** pH, pCO2, pO2, base excess, lactate (mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis)
- **BMP:** Potassium (hyperkalemia), calcium, creatinine, glucose
- **CK (creatine kinase):** Obtain immediately and q6h for 24-36 hours (peaks at 12-24 hours)
- **Myoglobin (serum and urine):** Confirms rhabdomyolysis
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer (DIC screen)
- **CBC:** Thrombocytopenia (DIC), hematocrit changes
- **Urinalysis:** Myoglobinuria (dipstick positive for blood without RBCs on microscopy)
- **Serial potassium** q1-2 hours during acute phase

## Treatment

### Dantrolene Protocol
- **Initial bolus:** 2.5 mg/kg IV push
- **Reconstitution:** Standard dantrolene (Dantrium): 20 mg/vial + 60 mL sterile water each; requires multiple vials and personnel to reconstitute rapidly. Ryanodex: 250 mg/vial + 5 mL sterile water (much faster to prepare)
- **Repeat:** 2.5 mg/kg IV q5 minutes until ETCO2 normalizes, rigidity resolves, tachycardia abates, and temperature trending down
- **Maintenance dose:** Dantrolene 1 mg/kg IV q4-6h for 24-48 hours after resolution to prevent recrudescence
- **No maximum dose** in a true MH crisis — continue until clinical improvement

### Hyperkalemia Management
- Calcium chloride 10 mg/kg IV (central line preferred) or calcium gluconate 30 mg/kg IV (peripheral OK) — membrane stabilization
- Regular insulin 0.1 units/kg IV + dextrose 50% 0.5 g/kg IV — intracellular potassium shift
- Sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg IV — intracellular potassium shift and acidosis correction
- Avoid calcium channel blockers (interaction with dantrolene causes hyperkalemia and cardiovascular collapse)

### Active Cooling
- Cold IV normal saline 1-2 L (4C)
- Ice packs to groin, axillae, neck
- Cooling blankets
- Cold gastric and bladder lavage for refractory hyperthermia
- Stop cooling at core temperature 38.5C

### Rhabdomyolysis Management
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation: NS 1-2 mL/kg/hr targeting urine output > 2 mL/kg/hr
- Monitor CK q6h for 36 hours
- Mannitol 0.25 g/kg IV for diuresis (included in dantrolene reconstitution)
- Sodium bicarbonate 1-2 mEq/kg IV to alkalinize urine (target urine pH > 6.5)

### Arrhythmia Management
- Treat underlying cause (hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperthermia)
- Amiodarone 150 mg IV over 10 min for VT
- Defibrillation per ACLS for VF/pulseless VT
- **Do NOT use calcium channel blockers** — fatal hyperkalemia and cardiovascular collapse when combined with dantrolene

## Disposition

- **All confirmed or suspected MH episodes:** ICU admission for minimum 24-48 hours
- **Continued dantrolene** 1 mg/kg IV q4-6h for 24-48 hours (recrudescence occurs in up to 25%)
- **Serial labs:** CK, potassium, ABG, coagulation studies q6h for 36 hours
- **Monitor urine output** (rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury risk)
- **Genetic counseling referral** for patient and first-degree relatives (RYR1 mutation testing, caffeine-halothane contracture testing)
- **MedAlert bracelet** and documentation of MH susceptibility in medical record
- **Report to MHAUS North American MH Registry**
- **Transfer** if ICU not available or if ECMO needed for refractory cardiovascular collapse

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for fever to diagnose MH.** Temperature elevation is a LATE sign. Rising ETCO2, tachycardia, and masseter rigidity after succinylcholine precede hyperthermia. Waiting for fever delays dantrolene by critical minutes.

2. **Insufficient dantrolene stocked in the ED.** A 100-kg patient requires 13 vials of standard dantrolene (20 mg/vial) for a single 2.5 mg/kg dose; MHAUS recommends stocking at least 36 vials (sufficient for approximately 3 loading doses). Know where MH carts are stored. Ryanodex (250 mg/vial) is faster to reconstitute.

3. **Administering calcium channel blockers with dantrolene.** The combination of dantrolene + verapamil or diltiazem causes fatal hyperkalemia and cardiovascular collapse. This is an absolute contraindication.

4. **Attributing masseter spasm after succinylcholine to "normal" jaw tightness.** Masseter muscle rigidity lasting > 2 minutes after succinylcholine administration is abnormal and warrants monitoring for MH. Generalized rigidity following masseter spasm mandates immediate MH treatment.

5. **Stopping dantrolene too soon.** Recrudescence occurs in up to 25% of MH episodes, typically 12-24 hours after initial treatment. Continue maintenance dantrolene 1 mg/kg IV q4-6h for minimum 24 hours. Monitor in ICU.

6. **Using an anesthesia machine contaminated with volatile agent to ventilate the patient.** Volatile agent persists in anesthesia circuits. Switch to a self-inflating bag-valve-mask (Ambu bag) with 100% O2 or a clean circuit that has never had volatile agents.

7. **Failing to recognize MH in the ED context.** MH is not limited to the OR. ED physicians perform RSI with succinylcholine. Any patient developing unexplained rigidity, tachycardia, or rising ETCO2 after succinylcholine warrants immediate evaluation for MH.

8. **Not calling the MH hotline (1-800-644-9737).** MHAUS provides 24/7 expert guidance. MH is rare, and real-time consultation improves management. The hotline is free and immediate.

9. **Overlooking rhabdomyolysis-induced renal failure.** CK peaks 12-24 hours after the event and may exceed 100,000 IU/L. Aggressive IV hydration targeting urine output > 2 mL/kg/hr prevents myoglobin-induced acute tubular necrosis.
