# Autonomic Dysreflexia

## Recognition

**Definition:**
- Life-threatening hypertensive emergency in patients with spinal cord injury at or above T6
- Triggered by noxious stimulus below the level of injury causing unopposed sympathetic discharge
- SBP elevation >= 20-40 mmHg above baseline (baseline SBP in SCI often 90-110 mmHg; SBP 150 mmHg may represent a crisis)

**Classic presentation:**
- Severe pounding headache (most common symptom)
- Paroxysmal hypertension (SBP 200-300 mmHg possible)
- Profuse diaphoresis and flushing above level of injury
- Piloerection above level of injury
- Pallor, cool skin, goosebumps below level of injury
- Nasal congestion
- Bradycardia (reflex; though tachycardia can occur)
- Blurred vision, anxiety, malaise
- Cardiac arrhythmias in severe cases

**Most common triggers (identify and remove):**
- Bladder distension (75-85%): blocked catheter, UTI, bladder stones, overfilled collection bag
- Bowel impaction (13-19%): constipation, fecal impaction, rectal distension
- Skin: pressure ulcers, ingrown toenails, tight clothing, burns
- Other: DVT, fracture below level of injury, sexual activity, pregnancy/labor, surgical stimulation

## Critical Actions

1. **Sit the patient upright immediately** — lower legs over side of bed to reduce venous return and lower BP
2. **Loosen all restrictive clothing** — abdominal binders, leg bag straps, tight shoes
3. **Check bladder** — if catheterized: check for kinks, irrigate or replace Foley; if no catheter: straight catheterize immediately (use lidocaine jelly 2% to prevent further noxious stimulation)
4. **If bladder not the cause, check rectum** — digital disimpaction with lidocaine jelly 2% topical anesthesia first; wait 2 minutes after applying lidocaine before disimpaction
5. **If SBP remains > 150 mmHg after removing cause:** pharmacologic intervention
6. **Monitor BP every 2-5 minutes** until resolved; continue monitoring for 2 hours post-resolution (risk of recurrence)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Essential hypertensive emergency (no SCI history, no trigger pattern)
- Pheochromocytoma crisis (paroxysmal, no SCI association, elevated catecholamines)
- Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (pregnancy, proteinuria)
- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (MRI findings, different context)
- Thyroid storm (hyperthermia, tachycardia, goiter)
- Drug-related hypertensive crisis (sympathomimetics, MAO inhibitor interaction)
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage (thunderclap headache, neck stiffness)

## Workup

- **Blood pressure** — immediate, compare to patient's known baseline (may be 90-110 mmHg)
- **Bladder scan** — assess for distension
- **ECG** — arrhythmia screen (bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, PVCs)
- **Urinalysis, urine culture** — UTI is a common trigger
- **Abdominal X-ray** — fecal loading, bladder distension
- **CBC, BMP** — baseline
- **Skin survey** — pressure ulcers, ingrown toenails, burns, tight clothing
- **CT head** only if headache persists after BP resolution or if stroke/hemorrhage suspected

## Treatment

### Non-Pharmacologic (First-Line)
- Sit patient upright, lower legs
- Remove all constrictive clothing and devices
- Catheterize bladder or clear catheter obstruction
- Disimpact rectum (with topical anesthetic)
- Inspect skin head-to-toe for noxious stimuli

### Pharmacologic (If BP Remains Elevated After Trigger Removal)
- **Nitropaste (nitroglycerin 2% ointment)** 1 inch (2.5 cm) applied to chest/upper arm; wipe off when BP controlled — rapidly acting, easily titrated by removal
- **Nifedipine** 10 mg PO (bite and swallow, NOT sublingual) — onset 10-15 min; may repeat in 30 min
- **Captopril** 25 mg PO/SL — onset 15-30 min
- **Nitroprusside** 0.5-10 mcg/kg/min IV — for severe refractory cases only, ICU setting
- **Hydralazine** 10-20 mg IV — onset 10-20 min; less preferred (unpredictable)
- **Prazosin** 1 mg PO — for chronic prophylaxis, not acute management
- **Avoid beta-blockers as monotherapy** — unopposed alpha stimulation worsens hypertension

### Refractory AD (SBP > 180 Persisting After Above)
- Nicardipine 5 mg/hr IV, titrate
- Consider phenoxybenzamine for recurrent episodes (alpha-blocker)
- Transfer to ICU if not resolving within 30 minutes

## Disposition

- **AD resolved with trigger identification and removal, BP normalized:** observe 2 hours, discharge with education if stable and reliable follow-up
- **Refractory AD (> 30 min despite treatment):** ICU admission
- **Complications (seizure, ICH, MI, retinal hemorrhage):** ICU admission with appropriate consultations
- **All patients:** ensure patient/caregiver education on trigger avoidance and recognition before discharge

## Pitfalls

1. **Not recognizing autonomic dysreflexia in the ED.** Many ED physicians are unfamiliar with AD. Any patient with SCI at T6 or above presenting with headache and hypertension has AD until proven otherwise.

2. **Treating the hypertension without finding and removing the trigger.** Pharmacologic BP lowering without trigger removal leads to recurrence. The most common cause is bladder distension — catheterize immediately.

3. **Using normal BP thresholds in SCI patients.** Baseline SBP in chronic SCI is often 90-110 mmHg. A "normal" SBP of 140 mmHg may represent a crisis. Always compare to known baseline.

4. **Performing rectal exam without topical anesthesia.** Digital rectal stimulation without lidocaine jelly can worsen the noxious afferent stimulus and exacerbate the hypertensive crisis.

5. **Administering beta-blockers as monotherapy.** Beta-blockers cause unopposed alpha-adrenergic stimulation, potentially worsening hypertension. If a beta-blocker is used, it must be combined with an alpha-blocker.

6. **Discharging without education.** AD recurs. Patients and caregivers must know triggers, symptoms, and the immediate action of sitting upright and checking the catheter. Provide a wallet card listing AD management steps.
