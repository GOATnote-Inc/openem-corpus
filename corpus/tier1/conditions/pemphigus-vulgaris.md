# Pemphigus Vulgaris

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Flaccid blisters on non-erythematous or mildly erythematous skin
- Blisters rupture easily → painful erosions with slow healing
- Oral mucosal involvement in ~70% as initial presentation (painful erosions on buccal mucosa, palate, gingiva, pharynx)
- Skin involvement follows: trunk, scalp, face, intertriginous areas
- Nikolsky sign positive (extension of blister with lateral pressure on adjacent normal-appearing skin)
- Asboe-Hansen sign positive (extension of blister with direct pressure on blister roof)
- No pruritus (pain predominates)
- Progressive disease if untreated

**Demographics:**
- Peak incidence 40-60 years
- Higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish, Mediterranean, South Asian populations
- Equal sex distribution

**Triggers/exacerbations:**
- Medications: ACE inhibitors, penicillamine, rifampin, NSAIDs
- UV radiation
- Emotional stress
- Viral infections

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess BSA involvement** — extensive disease (> 20-30% BSA) requires ICU-level management analogous to burns
2. **Evaluate for airway compromise** — pharyngeal, laryngeal involvement can obstruct airway
3. **Fluid and electrolyte resuscitation** for extensive skin loss
4. **Start high-dose corticosteroids** after dermatology consultation
5. **Wound care** — non-adherent dressings, gentle cleansing
6. **Dermatology consultation** — urgent for diagnosis confirmation and treatment initiation

## Differential Diagnosis

- Bullous pemphigoid — TENSE blisters on erythematous base (pemphigus has FLACCID blisters); elderly; positive DIF at BMZ
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TEN — drug-triggered, targetoid lesions, epidermal necrosis
- Erythema multiforme — typical target lesions, acral predominance
- Paraneoplastic pemphigus — associated with lymphoma/CLL; polymorphous lesions, severe stomatitis
- Pemphigus foliaceus — superficial blistering, NO mucosal involvement, crusted erosions
- Herpetic gingivostomatitis — grouped vesicles on erythematous base, positive HSV testing
- Aphthous stomatitis — discrete ulcers, no skin involvement
- Linear IgA bullous dermatosis — "string of pearls" pattern, responds to dapsone

## Workup

- **Skin biopsy for histology:** Perilesional skin — suprabasal acantholysis (intraepidermal split), "tombstone row" of basal keratinocytes along basement membrane
- **Direct immunofluorescence (DIF):** Perilesional skin — intercellular IgG and C3 deposition in "chicken wire" or "fishnet" pattern (gold standard)
- **Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF):** Serum — circulating IgG against desmoglein 1 and/or desmoglein 3
- **Desmoglein ELISA:**
  - Anti-desmoglein 3 positive: Mucosal-dominant PV
  - Anti-desmoglein 1 + 3 positive: Mucocutaneous PV
- **CBC, BMP, hepatic panel** — baseline before immunosuppression
- **Serum protein, albumin** — loss through denuded skin
- **Wound cultures** if superinfection suspected
- **Chest X-ray** — baseline before immunosuppression
- **TB screening (IGRA)** — before rituximab
- **Hepatitis B/C serologies** — before rituximab

## Treatment

### Acute/Emergency Management
- **Prednisone 1-2 mg/kg/day PO** (or methylprednisolone equivalent IV if unable to swallow)
- For severe disease: Methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily x 3 days (pulse therapy), then transition to oral prednisone
- **Rituximab 1000 mg IV** on day 1 and day 15 (now recommended as first-line alongside corticosteroids per 2024 guidelines)

### Wound Care
- Gentle cleansing with saline or chlorhexidine
- Non-adherent dressings (petrolatum-impregnated gauze, silicone dressings)
- Avoid adhesive dressings (worsens skin fragility)
- Silver sulfadiazine or mupirocin 2% ointment for erosions to prevent bacterial superinfection
- Oral care: Chlorhexidine 0.12% mouthwash BID, viscous lidocaine 2% before meals

### Fluid/Nutritional Support
- IV fluids: Estimate losses similar to burn patients for extensive disease
- High-protein diet; supplemental albumin if serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL
- Caloric supplementation; NG tube feeding if severe oral involvement

### Steroid-Sparing Agents (Initiated by Dermatology)
- Rituximab 1000 mg IV day 1 and day 15 (preferred steroid-sparing agent)
- Mycophenolate mofetil 1-1.5 g PO BID
- Azathioprine 2-3 mg/kg/day PO
- IVIG 2 g/kg divided over 3-5 days (for refractory disease)

### Infection Prevention
- PCP prophylaxis: TMP-SMX DS 1 tab PO MWF (if on high-dose steroids > 4 weeks)
- Calcium 1200 mg + vitamin D 800 IU PO daily (osteoporosis prevention)
- Monitor for herpes reactivation; consider prophylactic valacyclovir 500 mg PO daily

## Disposition

- **Admit if:** Extensive BSA involvement (> 20-30%), unable to tolerate PO, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, signs of superinfection/sepsis, airway involvement
- **Outpatient management** appropriate for limited disease with adequate pain control and PO intake
- **Dermatology follow-up** within 1 week for all new diagnoses
- **Long-term management:** Requires ongoing immunosuppression and dermatology follow-up; disease course is chronic with remissions and flares
- **Isolation:** Standard precautions; NOT infectious
- **Reportable:** Not a reportable disease

## Pitfalls

1. **Confusing pemphigus vulgaris with bullous pemphigoid.** PV has FLACCID blisters and positive Nikolsky sign; BP has TENSE blisters on erythematous base. PV involves mucosa first; BP rarely involves mucosa severely. The distinction matters because PV is more aggressive and has higher mortality.

2. **Dismissing oral erosions as aphthous ulcers.** Persistent, non-healing oral erosions that fail to respond to standard aphthous treatment should raise suspicion for PV. Biopsy is diagnostic.

3. **Not assessing for airway involvement.** Pharyngeal and laryngeal pemphigus can cause airway obstruction. Dysphagia, odynophagia, or hoarseness in a pemphigus patient requires urgent ENT evaluation.

4. **Debriding blisters aggressively.** The blister roof in PV acts as a biologic dressing. Remove only necrotic tissue; leave intact blister roofs in place where possible.

5. **Starting rituximab without TB and hepatitis screening.** Rituximab causes profound B-cell depletion. Latent TB or hepatitis B can reactivate with fatal consequences. Screen before treatment.

6. **Underestimating fluid losses.** Extensive pemphigus with widespread erosions causes significant transepidermal water loss and protein loss analogous to burns. Aggressive fluid and albumin replacement may be needed.
