# Acute Ascending Cholangitis

## Recognition

### Pathophysiology
Bacterial infection of the biliary tract due to obstruction. Increased biliary pressure causes bacteremia and sepsis. Without decompression, progresses to suppurative cholangitis, hepatic abscess, and multiorgan failure.

### Charcot's Triad (present in 50-70%)
1. **Fever/chills** (rigors common)
2. **Jaundice** (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia)
3. **Right upper quadrant pain**

### Reynolds' Pentad (Charcot's triad plus — indicates severe/suppurative cholangitis)
4. **Hypotension**
5. **Altered mental status**

### Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) — Diagnostic Criteria
**Suspected diagnosis:** Systemic inflammation (fever > 38 degrees C, WBC > 10,000 or < 4,000, CRP >= 1 mg/dL) + cholestasis (jaundice, abnormal LFTs: ALP/GGT/AST/ALT > 1.5x upper limit of normal) OR biliary imaging showing etiology (biliary dilation, stone, stent, stricture)

**Definite diagnosis:** Systemic inflammation + cholestasis + biliary imaging evidence

### TG18 Severity Grading

| Grade | Criteria | Management |
|---|---|---|
| **Grade I (Mild)** | Does not meet Grade II or III criteria; responds to initial antibiotics | Antibiotics; elective biliary drainage |
| **Grade II (Moderate)** | Any 2 of: WBC > 12,000 or < 4,000, fever >= 39 degrees C, age >= 75, total bilirubin >= 5 mg/dL, albumin < 0.7x lower limit of normal | Antibiotics + early biliary drainage (within 48-72h) |
| **Grade III (Severe)** | Organ dysfunction: cardiovascular (hypotension requiring vasopressors), neurologic (altered mental status), respiratory (PaO2/FiO2 < 300), renal (creatinine > 2 mg/dL), hepatic (INR > 1.5), hematologic (platelets < 100,000) | Emergent biliary drainage (within 24h) + ICU care |

### Common Etiologies
- **Choledocholithiasis** (most common, 40-70%)
- **Benign biliary stricture** (post-surgical, chronic pancreatitis)
- **Malignant obstruction** (pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary carcinoma)
- **Biliary stent occlusion/migration**
- **Parasitic infection** (Clonorchis sinensis, Ascaris lumbricoides — endemic regions)
- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis** with superimposed infection

### Microbiology
- **Gram-negative:** E. coli (most common, 25-50%), Klebsiella (15-20%), Enterobacter, Pseudomonas
- **Gram-positive:** Enterococcus (10-20%)
- **Anaerobes:** Bacteroides, Clostridium (10-15%, more common with prior biliary-enteric anastomosis)
- Polymicrobial in 30-50%

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Blood cultures (2 sets) | Before antibiotics |
| Empiric IV antibiotics | Within 1 hour of recognition |
| IV fluid resuscitation | Immediately if hypotensive |
| RUQ ultrasound | Within 2 hours |
| ERCP (Grade III) | Within 24 hours |
| ERCP (Grade II) | Within 48-72 hours |
| Surgical/GI consult | Immediately for Grade III |

1. Obtain 2 sets of blood cultures (aerobic + anaerobic) from 2 sites before antibiotics. Blood cultures positive in 40-70% of cholangitis cases.
2. Start empiric IV antibiotics within 1 hour.
3. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with Ringer's lactate for sepsis/hypotension (30 mL/kg bolus if septic shock).
4. Order STAT labs: CBC, CMP, lipase, total and direct bilirubin, INR, lactate.
5. RUQ ultrasound: assess CBD diameter, stones, intrahepatic ductal dilation.
6. Consult GI/interventional endoscopy for ERCP and surgery if ERCP not available.
7. Vasopressors if fluid-refractory hypotension (norepinephrine first-line).

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute cholecystitis:** Murphy sign positive, gallbladder wall thickening > 3 mm, pericholecystic fluid, no biliary ductal dilation; less likely to have jaundice
- **Acute pancreatitis:** Epigastric pain radiating to back, lipase > 3x upper limit of normal; may coexist with cholangitis
- **Hepatic abscess:** Subacute fever, RUQ pain, CT shows hepatic collection
- **Acute hepatitis:** Viral, alcoholic, drug-induced; transaminases often > 1,000 (less typical of cholangitis)
- **Biliary colic:** Colicky RUQ pain without fever or laboratory evidence of infection/obstruction
- **Perforated peptic ulcer:** Acute abdomen, free air on imaging
- **Right lower lobe pneumonia:** RUQ pain referred from diaphragm, cough, CXR findings
- **Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome:** Perihepatitis from PID; young women, RUQ pain, elevated ESR
- **Mirizzi syndrome:** External compression of common hepatic duct by impacted cystic duct stone; mimics cholangitis

## Workup

### Laboratory Studies
- **CBC with differential:** Leukocytosis (WBC > 10,000) or leukopenia (WBC < 4,000); left shift
- **CMP:** Elevated direct (conjugated) bilirubin; alkaline phosphatase and GGT elevated (cholestatic pattern); AST/ALT moderately elevated (usually 2-5x normal, can be higher with acute obstruction)
- **Total and direct bilirubin:** Direct bilirubin typically > 2 mg/dL; total bilirubin >= 5 mg/dL suggests moderate severity (TG18 Grade II criterion)
- **INR/PT:** Prolonged if hepatic dysfunction or vitamin K deficiency from obstruction
- **Lipase:** Elevated if concomitant pancreatitis (common with choledocholithiasis)
- **Lactate:** Elevated in sepsis/severe cholangitis
- **Blood cultures:** 2 sets before antibiotics; positive in 40-70%
- **CRP/procalcitonin:** Elevated; support TG18 diagnostic criteria (CRP >= 1 mg/dL)

### Imaging
- **RUQ ultrasound (first-line):** CBD dilation > 6 mm (> 8 mm if postcholecystectomy), intrahepatic ductal dilation, CBD stones (sensitivity 50-80% for CBD stones). May show gallbladder stones suggesting choledocholithiasis as etiology.
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** If ultrasound equivocal; detects biliary dilation, stones (calcified), masses, abscess, pancreatitis. Sensitivity for CBD stones: 70-80%.
- **MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography):** Sensitivity 90-95% for CBD stones; preferred noninvasive study when ultrasound is equivocal and ERCP is not immediately indicated. Do not delay ERCP for MRCP in Grade III cholangitis.
- **EUS (endoscopic ultrasound):** Sensitivity > 95% for CBD stones; can be combined with ERCP in same session.

## Treatment

### Empiric Antibiotics (administer within 1 hour)

**Community-acquired, mild-moderate (Grade I-II):**
- Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (covers Gram-negatives, enterococcus, anaerobes)
- OR ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
- OR ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h (if enterococcal coverage not needed)

**Healthcare-associated or severe (Grade III):**
- Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (extended infusion over 4 hours preferred in sepsis)
- OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h (if ESBL-producing organisms suspected or prior antibiotic failure)
- Add vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose if MRSA risk or prior biliary instrumentation with indwelling device

**Penicillin allergy:**
- Ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV q12h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
- OR aztreonam 2 g IV q8h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h + vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV

**Duration:** 4-7 days after source control (biliary drainage). Longer if bacteremia or inadequate source control.

### Biliary Decompression

**ERCP (preferred first-line for biliary drainage):**
- **Grade III:** Emergent ERCP within 24 hours. Perform after initial hemodynamic stabilization. Biliary sphincterotomy + stone extraction or stent placement.
- **Grade II:** Early ERCP within 48-72 hours
- **Grade I:** Semi-elective ERCP; timing based on clinical trajectory

**Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD):**
- When ERCP fails or is unavailable (tumor obstruction with failed ERCP, surgically altered anatomy — Roux-en-Y)
- Interventional radiology placement of external or external-internal drain

**Surgical drainage (open or laparoscopic common bile duct exploration):**
- Last resort; reserved for failed ERCP and PTBD, or when surgical intervention needed for the underlying cause

### Hemodynamic Support
- IV crystalloid resuscitation: Ringer's lactate 30 mL/kg bolus for sepsis-induced hypotension
- Norepinephrine 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV for vasopressor-dependent shock (MAP target >= 65 mmHg)
- Vasopressin 0.03 units/min IV as second agent if norepinephrine insufficient

### Pain Management
- Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q2-4h or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV q3-4h
- Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV once (avoid if renal dysfunction, coagulopathy, or concurrent anticoagulation)
- Avoid meperidine (no evidence it causes less sphincter of Oddi spasm than other opioids; worse side effect profile)

## Disposition

- **All patients with ascending cholangitis require admission.** No exceptions.
- **Grade III (severe):** ICU admission. Emergent GI/ERCP consult. Emergent biliary decompression within 24 hours. If local ERCP unavailable, transfer to a facility with 24/7 ERCP capability.
- **Grade II (moderate):** Floor admission with telemetry. ERCP within 48-72 hours. Escalate to ICU if clinical deterioration.
- **Grade I (mild):** Floor admission. Antibiotics with planned elective biliary drainage. Monitor for escalation.
- **Transfer criteria:** If the facility lacks ERCP capability or interventional radiology for PTBD, initiate antibiotics and transfer to a tertiary center. Grade III patients should not wait.
- **Post-ERCP observation:** Monitor for post-ERCP pancreatitis (5-10%), bleeding, perforation. Repeat labs at 6 hours post-procedure.

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for the classic Charcot's triad to make the diagnosis.** Charcot's triad is present in only 50-70% of cases. Many patients present with only fever and abnormal LFTs, or with sepsis of unclear source. Use TG18 criteria for systematic diagnosis.

2. **Delaying antibiotics for imaging or ERCP.** Antibiotics within 1 hour reduce mortality in biliary sepsis. Start empiric antibiotics after blood cultures and before any imaging or procedural intervention.

3. **Ordering MRCP before ERCP in Grade III (severe) cholangitis.** Grade III cholangitis with organ dysfunction requires emergent biliary decompression. Obtaining MRCP delays definitive treatment. Proceed directly to ERCP.

4. **Missing choledocholithiasis on ultrasound.** Ultrasound sensitivity for CBD stones is only 50-80%. A normal ultrasound does not exclude choledocholithiasis. If clinical suspicion remains, pursue MRCP, EUS, or direct ERCP.

5. **Using the normal CBD diameter cutoff in postcholecystectomy patients.** After cholecystectomy, the CBD physiologically dilates to 8-10 mm. A CBD of 7 mm in a postcholecystectomy patient is normal, not pathologic.

6. **Failing to obtain blood cultures before antibiotics.** Blood cultures are positive in 40-70% of ascending cholangitis cases and guide antibiotic de-escalation. Draw 2 sets from 2 sites before the first antibiotic dose.

7. **Not recognizing biliary stent occlusion as a cause.** Patients with previously placed biliary stents (for malignancy or stricture) are at high risk for ascending cholangitis from stent occlusion or migration. Maintain high suspicion in any patient with a biliary stent presenting with fever.

8. **Discharging a patient with resolved fever after antibiotics.** Cholangitis recurs without definitive biliary decompression. Antibiotics treat the infection but do not relieve the obstruction. All patients need ERCP or alternative drainage before discharge is appropriate.

9. **Choosing meperidine over other opioids for "sphincter of Oddi concerns."** The claim that meperidine causes less sphincter of Oddi spasm is not supported by evidence. Use standard opioid analgesics (morphine, hydromorphone). Do not withhold analgesia based on this myth.

10. **Underestimating severity in elderly or immunosuppressed patients.** Elderly patients may be afebrile with cholangitis. Immunosuppressed patients may lack leukocytosis. A low threshold for workup is needed when any component of Charcot's triad is present, even in isolation.
