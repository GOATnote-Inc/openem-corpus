# Purpura Fulminans

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Rapidly progressive purpuric skin lesions — beginning as erythematous macules → purpura → hemorrhagic bullae → necrotic eschars
- Pain out of proportion to initial appearance
- Lesions expand rapidly (hours)
- Symmetric involvement of distal extremities (fingers, toes, ears, nose)
- Central body involvement in severe cases (trunk, buttocks, genitalia)
- Acral cyanosis progressing to gangrene
- Signs of septic shock: fever/hypothermia, tachycardia, hypotension

**Three types:**
1. **Acute infectious (most common):** Meningococcemia, pneumococcal sepsis, streptococcal (GAS), staphylococcal; occurs during active infection
2. **Post-infectious (idiopathic):** 7-10 days after varicella or streptococcal infection; autoantibodies against protein S
3. **Neonatal:** Homozygous protein C or protein S deficiency; presents within hours to days of birth

**Pathophysiology:**
- Overwhelming DIC with microvascular thrombosis
- Acquired protein C and S depletion (consumed during sepsis-associated DIC)
- Endothelial damage → thrombotic occlusion of dermal vessels → hemorrhagic skin necrosis

## Critical Actions

1. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation** — septic shock protocol; NS or LR 30 mL/kg IV bolus, repeat as needed
2. **Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics within 30 minutes:**
   - Ceftriaxone 2 g IV PLUS vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose
   - ADD clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h (toxin inhibition for GAS/Staph)
3. **Vasopressors** — norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min for septic shock
4. **Correct coagulopathy:** FFP 15-20 mL/kg, cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL, platelets if < 50,000 with active bleeding
5. **Protein C concentrate 100 IU/kg IV** if available — replenishes depleted natural anticoagulant
6. **Consider heparin** — low-dose UFH 10 units/kg/hr if thrombosis predominates and bleeding controlled
7. **ICU admission** immediately

## Differential Diagnosis

- Meningococcemia without purpura fulminans — petechial rash, but not rapidly progressive or necrotic
- DIC from other causes — sepsis, malignancy, obstetric; skin necrosis less prominent
- Warfarin-induced skin necrosis — temporal relationship to warfarin initiation (days 3-5), protein C depletion
- Calciphylaxis — chronic kidney disease, reticular purpura, calcified vessels
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia — thrombosis pattern, temporal relation to heparin
- Antiphospholipid syndrome — livedo reticularis, recurrent thromboses, prolonged aPTT
- Cryoglobulinemia — cold-triggered purpura, hepatitis C association
- Cholesterol crystal embolism — blue toe syndrome, livedo, renal failure, post-catheterization

## Workup

- **CBC:** Thrombocytopenia (often severe)
- **Coagulation studies:** Prolonged PT/INR, prolonged aPTT, low fibrinogen (< 100 mg/dL)
- **D-dimer:** Markedly elevated
- **Peripheral blood smear:** Schistocytes (microangiopathic hemolysis)
- **ISTH DIC score:** Typically >= 5 (overt DIC)
- **Protein C and S levels** (draw BEFORE FFP/anticoagulation if possible, but do not delay treatment)
- **Blood cultures** x 2 sets — before antibiotics if feasible
- **Meningococcal PCR** if suspected
- **Lactate** — elevated in septic shock
- **BMP, hepatic panel** — multi-organ dysfunction assessment
- **ABG** — metabolic acidosis, base deficit
- **Troponin** — myocardial dysfunction
- **Skin biopsy** (can be deferred acutely) — dermal vessel thrombosis with hemorrhagic infarction
- **Lumbar puncture** if meningitis suspected AND no contraindication (do NOT delay antibiotics for LP)

## Treatment

### Sepsis Management
- **Antibiotics:**
  - Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h PLUS vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h
  - ADD clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h (inhibits toxin production)
  - Narrow based on cultures
- **Fluid resuscitation:** Crystalloid 30 mL/kg IV bolus within first 3 hours; reassess
- **Vasopressors:** Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min; add vasopressin 0.04 units/min if refractory
- **Stress-dose hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h** for vasopressor-refractory shock

### Coagulation Support
- **FFP 15-20 mL/kg** — replenishes consumed clotting factors AND natural anticoagulants (protein C, S, antithrombin)
- **Cryoprecipitate 10 units** if fibrinogen < 150 mg/dL
- **Platelet transfusion** if < 50,000/mm3 with active bleeding or < 20,000 prophylactically
- **Protein C concentrate (Ceprotin) 100 IU/kg IV** if available — addresses the core deficiency
  - Neonatal homozygous PC deficiency: 100-120 IU/kg loading, then 60 IU/kg q6h; titrate to PC activity 100%

### Anticoagulation (Controversial, Case-Dependent)
- **Low-dose heparin 10 units/kg/hr IV** (no bolus) — may limit microvascular thrombosis if bleeding controlled
- Only when fibrinogen > 100 mg/dL AND platelets > 50,000
- Not appropriate in actively hemorrhaging patients
- Consult hematology before initiating

### Limb/Skin Management
- **Do NOT debride early** — demarcation may take 3-6 weeks
- **Vascular surgery consultation** — for limb salvage assessment
- **Fasciotomy** if compartment syndrome develops
- **Amputation** — delayed (weeks) after demarcation; often required for digits, distal extremities
- **Wound care:** Topical antimicrobials, non-adherent dressings

### IVIG
- Intravenous immunoglobulin 1 g/kg IV x 1-2 days — may neutralize bacterial toxins and modulate immune response

## Disposition

- **All purpura fulminans patients:** ICU admission with sepsis protocol
- **Surgical consultation** for potential limb salvage, fasciotomy, eventual debridement
- **Hematology consultation** for coagulopathy management and protein C replacement
- **Infectious disease consultation** for antibiotic optimization
- **Long-term:** Skin grafting, limb amputation, prosthetics referral
- **Neonatal PF:** Transfer to tertiary NICU with hematology expertise
- **Isolation:** Droplet precautions if meningococcal disease suspected
- **Reportable:** Meningococcal disease is IMMEDIATELY reportable; Group A streptococcal invasive disease is also reportable in most jurisdictions. All cases warrant public health notification.

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying antibiotics.** Purpura fulminans is a medical emergency with mortality 40-60%. Every minute of antibiotic delay increases mortality. Broad-spectrum antibiotics must be given within 30 minutes of recognition.

2. **Not adding clindamycin for toxin inhibition.** Clostridial, streptococcal, and staphylococcal infections driving purpura fulminans produce toxins that perpetuate the inflammatory cascade. Clindamycin inhibits toxin synthesis at the ribosomal level and should be added to the antibiotic regimen.

3. **Early debridement of necrotic skin.** Demarcation between viable and non-viable tissue takes weeks. Premature debridement removes potentially viable tissue and worsens outcomes. Wait for full demarcation unless infection of necrotic tissue occurs.

4. **Not considering protein C replacement.** Protein C concentrate directly addresses the pathophysiology. Where available, it should be administered early. If concentrate is unavailable, FFP provides partial protein C replacement.

5. **Confusing purpura fulminans with warfarin skin necrosis.** Both involve protein C depletion, but purpura fulminans is acute, sepsis-associated, and requires antibiotics + resuscitation. Warfarin necrosis occurs days after warfarin initiation in patients with protein C deficiency.

6. **Missing meningococcemia.** N. meningitidis is the most common infectious cause of purpura fulminans. Petechial/purpuric rash in a febrile patient is meningococcemia until proven otherwise. Close contacts need prophylaxis (rifampin 600 mg PO BID x 2 days or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO x 1 dose).
