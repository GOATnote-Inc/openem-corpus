# Ovarian Torsion

## Recognition

**Definition:** Partial or complete rotation of the ovary (and often the fallopian tube) around its vascular pedicle, causing venous congestion, ischemia, and eventual necrosis. Analogous to testicular torsion — a time-sensitive surgical emergency.

**Classic Presentation:**
- Sudden-onset unilateral lower abdominal/pelvic pain (typically severe)
- Nausea and vomiting (70%)
- Low-grade fever (late finding, suggests necrosis)
- Pain may radiate to the flank or ipsilateral groin
- Right-sided in ~60% of cases (long sigmoid mesentery may protect left ovary)

**Intermittent Torsion/Detorsion (diagnostic trap):**
- Waxing and waning pain with symptom-free intervals
- Patient may present repeatedly with "resolved" pelvic pain
- Partial torsion with spontaneous detorsion mimics ovarian cyst rupture, PID, or gastroenteritis
- Each episode of torsion causes cumulative ischemic damage

**Risk Factors:**
- Ovarian mass or cyst > 5 cm (most common predisposing factor; teratoma, cystadenoma, functional cyst)
- Reproductive age (peak incidence 20-30 years)
- Pregnancy (corpus luteum enlargement; 20% of torsion cases occur in pregnancy)
- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (IVF/fertility treatment — bilateral enlarged ovaries)
- Prior pelvic surgery or tubal ligation
- Hypermobile adnexa (long utero-ovarian ligament)

**Pediatric/Prepubertal:**
- Occurs at any age, including neonates and prepubertal girls
- Prepubertal torsion often involves a normal ovary (no mass)
- Presentation: acute abdominal pain, vomiting; frequently misdiagnosed as appendicitis or gastroenteritis

## Critical Actions

1. **Maintain high clinical suspicion.** Ovarian torsion is a clinical diagnosis supported by imaging. No test definitively excludes torsion short of surgery. Any woman with acute unilateral pelvic pain requires torsion on the differential.
2. **Pelvic ultrasound with Doppler** — obtain urgently. Evaluate for enlarged ovary, adnexal mass, free fluid, and ovarian blood flow. Absent/decreased arterial flow supports the diagnosis but normal flow does NOT exclude torsion.
3. **Consult OB/GYN emergently** — for operative laparoscopy (detorsion +/- oophoropexy). Do not delay consultation for additional testing.
4. **IV analgesia** — morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV. Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV as adjunct. Pain control should not delay surgical consultation.
5. **NPO status** — anticipate emergent surgery. Begin IV fluid resuscitation with NS or LR.
6. **Obtain pregnancy test** — urine or serum beta-hCG in all women of reproductive age. Torsion occurs in pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy is also on the differential).
7. **Antiemetics** — ondansetron 4 mg IV for nausea/vomiting.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Ruptured ovarian cyst | Sudden pain, often mid-cycle; free fluid on ultrasound; ovary normal size; pain often improves over hours; no ovarian enlargement |
| Ectopic pregnancy | Positive beta-hCG, adnexal mass or free fluid, no IUP on ultrasound; vaginal bleeding common |
| Acute appendicitis | RLQ pain, anorexia, fever; periumbilical-to-RLQ migration; CT shows inflamed appendix; no ovarian enlargement |
| Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) | Bilateral pain, cervical motion tenderness, vaginal discharge, fever; onset typically gradual; cervical cultures positive |
| Tubo-ovarian abscess | Fever, bilateral pain, adnexal mass; complex fluid collection on ultrasound; subacute presentation |
| Endometriosis/endometrioma | Cyclic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia; "chocolate cyst" on ultrasound; chronic history |
| Renal colic (ureteral stone) | Colicky flank-to-groin pain, hematuria, hydronephrosis on CT/ultrasound; no ovarian pathology |
| Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst | Acute pain, echogenic cyst on ultrasound; ovary not enlarged beyond the cyst; stable vs. torsion which progresses |
| Degenerating fibroid | Known fibroids; localized uterine tenderness; heterogeneous fibroid on ultrasound; subacute onset |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- **Pelvic ultrasound with Doppler (first-line):**
  - Enlarged ovary (> 4 cm in longest dimension; often > 6 cm) — edema from venous congestion
  - Adnexal mass (dermoid, cystadenoma, functional cyst)
  - Peripherally displaced follicles ("string of pearls" sign) — edematous stroma pushes follicles to periphery
  - Free pelvic fluid (small amount common)
  - Whirlpool sign: twisted vascular pedicle on color Doppler (pathognomonic when present)
  - Doppler flow assessment:
    - Absent arterial and venous flow: highly specific but late finding
    - Decreased or absent venous flow with preserved arterial flow: suggests early/partial torsion
    - **Normal Doppler flow does NOT exclude torsion** — sensitivity only 46-73% due to dual blood supply (ovarian artery + uterine artery collaterals) and intermittent torsion/detorsion
  - Compare to contralateral ovary: asymmetric enlargement supports diagnosis
- **CT abdomen/pelvis** (if obtained for undifferentiated abdominal pain):
  - Enlarged ovary, adnexal mass, deviation of uterus toward affected side
  - Thickened fallopian tube
  - Less sensitive than ultrasound for ovarian torsion; not first-line

**Labs:**
- Urine or serum beta-hCG: mandatory in reproductive-age women
- CBC: leukocytosis (nonspecific; may be elevated with necrosis)
- BMP: baseline renal function
- Urinalysis: exclude UTI, identify hematuria (renal colic)
- Lactate: may be elevated with tissue ischemia (nonspecific)
- Type and screen: if surgery anticipated and hemoglobin low

**Physical Exam:**
- Unilateral adnexal tenderness (most consistent finding)
- Palpable adnexal mass (present in ~50% on bimanual exam)
- Peritoneal signs: guarding, rebound (suggests necrosis or rupture)
- Cervical motion tenderness: may be present (overlaps with PID)
- Abdominal distension (if large mass)

## Treatment

**Definitive Treatment: Emergent Surgical Intervention**
- **Laparoscopy** is the surgical approach of choice
- **Detorsion** (untwisting the ovary): preferred over oophorectomy even if the ovary appears dusky/black. Ovarian viability cannot be reliably assessed by visual appearance alone. Reperfusion salvages ovaries in 88-100% of cases when detorsion is performed.
- **Oophoropexy** (fixation of the ovary): performed after detorsion to prevent recurrence, particularly in patients without a mass or with a history of prior torsion
- **Oophorectomy** (removal): reserved for confirmed necrosis that does not reperfuse, postmenopausal patients, or suspicion of malignancy
- **Cystectomy**: removal of the predisposing cyst/mass at the time of detorsion if benign-appearing

**Pre-Operative ED Management:**
- NPO status
- IV access with NS or LR at 125-250 mL/hr
- Analgesia: morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q2-4h PRN or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV q3-4h PRN
- Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV (unless pregnant or renal impairment)
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV for nausea/vomiting
- Preoperative labs: CBC, BMP, type and screen, coagulation studies
- Antibiotics: not routinely indicated unless necrosis or infection suspected (piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV if concern for tubo-ovarian abscess)

**In Pregnancy:**
- Torsion most common in first trimester (corpus luteum cyst)
- Laparoscopy is safe in all trimesters (preferred over laparotomy when feasible)
- Progesterone supplementation may be needed if the corpus luteum is removed before 10 weeks gestation
- Consult OB/GYN and MFM (maternal-fetal medicine) if second/third trimester

## Disposition

**Operative — All Confirmed or Highly Suspected Ovarian Torsion:**
- Emergent OB/GYN consultation and operative laparoscopy
- Time to detorsion determines ovarian salvage: salvage rate drops significantly after 6-8 hours of complete torsion
- Same-day surgery is the standard of care; overnight observation while waiting for OR is acceptable only if pain is controlled and index of suspicion is moderate (not high)

**Admit (Post-Operative):**
- Observation after detorsion: serial abdominal exams, pain reassessment
- Patients with ovarian necrosis/oophorectomy: monitor for post-operative complications
- Pregnant patients: fetal monitoring as appropriate for gestational age

**Discharge (with close follow-up):**
- Post-operative patients with uncomplicated detorsion: discharge same day or next morning with OB/GYN follow-up in 1-2 weeks
- Patients with negative surgical exploration: evaluate for alternative diagnoses; follow-up in 1 week
- Patients in whom torsion was considered but imaging and exam are reassuring: discharge ONLY if reliable follow-up in 24-48 hours and clear return precautions (worsening pain, vomiting, fever). Emphasize that torsion cannot be fully excluded without surgery.

## Pitfalls

1. **Excluding ovarian torsion because Doppler flow is present.** Normal arterial and venous flow on Doppler does NOT rule out torsion. The dual blood supply (ovarian artery from the aorta and collateral from the uterine artery) allows partial flow even with torsion. Doppler sensitivity is only 46-73%. Torsion is a clinical-surgical diagnosis.

2. **Diagnosing ovarian cyst rupture and discharging the patient without considering torsion.** Both present with acute pelvic pain and free fluid on ultrasound. An enlarged ovary with free fluid is more consistent with torsion than cyst rupture. Cyst rupture pain typically improves; torsion pain persists or worsens.

3. **Missing intermittent torsion/detorsion.** Patients with waxing-waning pelvic pain and an adnexal mass likely have intermittent torsion. A "normal" ultrasound obtained during a pain-free interval (after spontaneous detorsion) does not exclude the diagnosis. Correlate imaging with symptom timing.

4. **Not considering torsion in prepubertal girls.** Ovarian torsion occurs in children, including neonates. Prepubertal ovaries torse without a mass (normal ovary on a long pedicle). Acute abdominal pain in a girl should include torsion on the differential, not just appendicitis.

5. **Not considering torsion in pregnant patients.** Twenty percent of ovarian torsion cases occur during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester (corpus luteum cyst). Delay in diagnosis risks ovarian loss. Pelvic ultrasound is safe and indicated for acute pelvic pain in pregnancy.

6. **Performing oophorectomy based on dark/dusky ovarian appearance.** A visually necrotic-appearing ovary frequently recovers function after detorsion. Reperfusion salvages ovaries in 88-100% of cases. Oophorectomy should be reserved for tissue that clearly does not reperfuse or when malignancy is suspected.

7. **Delaying OB/GYN consultation while pursuing additional diagnostic testing.** Ovarian torsion is a time-sensitive surgical emergency. CT, MRI, and repeat labs should not delay surgical consultation. Consult OB/GYN based on clinical suspicion and ultrasound findings, not on a definitive imaging diagnosis.

8. **Attributing pelvic pain to PID without considering torsion.** Cervical motion tenderness is present in both PID and torsion. Torsion is typically unilateral and sudden in onset; PID is often bilateral and gradual. Obtain pelvic ultrasound before attributing acute unilateral pain to PID.

9. **Failing to check a pregnancy test.** Ectopic pregnancy and ovarian torsion have overlapping presentations (acute unilateral pelvic pain, adnexal mass, free fluid). A positive pregnancy test shifts the differential but does not exclude torsion (torsion occurs in pregnancy). A negative test does not exclude ectopic pregnancy if very early.

10. **Discharging a patient with persistent unilateral pelvic pain and an enlarged ovary on ultrasound.** An ovary > 5 cm with pain is torsion until proven otherwise. If torsion cannot be excluded by imaging, surgical exploration is warranted. Do not discharge for "outpatient follow-up" if clinical suspicion is moderate to high.
