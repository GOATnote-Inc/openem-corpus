# Neutropenic Fever

## Recognition

**Definition:** Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500 cells/mcL (or <1000 cells/mcL and expected to decline to <500 within 48 hours) PLUS single oral temperature >=38.3C (101F) or sustained temperature >=38.0C (100.4F) for >=1 hour.

### Classic Presentation
- Cancer patient on recent chemotherapy (typically 7-14 days post-cycle, during nadir)
- Fever — may be the ONLY sign of life-threatening infection
- Minimal or absent inflammatory response (no erythema, no purulence, no infiltrate on CXR) due to absent neutrophils
- Tachycardia, hypotension (sepsis without a localizable source)
- Mucositis (oral, GI) — common portal of entry for translocation of gut flora

### Common Infection Sources
- Bloodstream (bacteremia without a focus — most common identifiable source)
- Lungs (pneumonia — may have no infiltrate on initial CXR due to absent neutrophils)
- Skin/soft tissue (cellulitis, catheter exit site, perianal infections)
- GI tract (neutropenic enterocolitis/typhlitis, C. difficile, mucositis)
- Urinary tract

### Risk Stratification — MASCC Score
| Variable | Score |
|---|---|
| Burden of illness: mild or no symptoms | 5 |
| Burden of illness: moderate symptoms | 3 |
| No hypotension (SBP >90) | 5 |
| No COPD | 4 |
| Solid tumor or no prior fungal infection in hematologic malignancy | 4 |
| No dehydration requiring IV fluids | 3 |
| Outpatient at fever onset | 3 |
| Age <60 years | 2 |

- **MASCC >=21:** Low risk (~5% serious complications). May qualify for oral outpatient therapy if meeting all criteria.
- **MASCC <21:** High risk. Requires IV antibiotics and admission.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Door-to-antibiotic | <=60 minutes — treat this as a sepsis equivalent |
| Blood cultures (2 sets, peripheral + line) | Before antibiotics BUT do not delay antibiotics for cultures |
| Empiric anti-pseudomonal antibiotic | Monotherapy — no waiting for culture results |
| Assess for hemodynamic instability | Immediate fluid resuscitation if septic |
| Remove/examine all indwelling catheters | Assess for catheter-related infection |
| Rectal exam contraindicated | Risk of bacteremia from mucosal disruption |

1. Triage immediately — do NOT place in waiting room (immunocompromised patient in a room with other sick patients)
2. Obtain CBC with differential to confirm ANC
3. Draw blood cultures: 2 sets from separate peripheral sites + 1 set from each lumen of central venous catheter
4. Administer empiric anti-pseudomonal antibiotic within 60 minutes of triage — do NOT wait for culture results or ANC confirmation if high suspicion
5. Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation for hypotension: 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus
6. Obtain additional workup guided by symptoms (CXR, UA, wound cultures)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Drug fever (diagnosis of exclusion — timing with chemotherapy, no localizable source, patient appears well)
- Transfusion reaction (temporal relationship to blood product administration)
- Tumor fever (malignancy-related — typically low-grade, responds to naproxen)
- Venous thromboembolism (fever + cancer + immobility; evaluate with CT if clinical concern)
- Adrenal insufficiency (chronic steroid use common in cancer patients)
- Viral reactivation (HSV, VZV, CMV — particularly in hematologic malignancies and post-transplant)
- Fungal infection (if neutropenia >7 days — Aspergillus, Candida)
- Typhlitis/neutropenic enterocolitis (RLQ pain, fever, cecal wall thickening on CT)

## Workup

- **CBC with differential:** Confirm ANC. ANC = WBC x (% segs + % bands) / 100.
- **Blood cultures:** 2 sets from separate peripheral venipuncture sites PLUS 1 set from each lumen of any central venous catheter. Draw before antibiotics when possible — but NEVER delay antibiotics for cultures.
- **BMP:** Renal function (drug dosing), electrolytes (chemotherapy-related derangements)
- **Hepatic panel:** Baseline; hepatic dysfunction alters drug metabolism
- **Lactate:** Marker of tissue hypoperfusion; elevated lactate mandates aggressive resuscitation
- **Procalcitonin:** May guide de-escalation decisions; limited utility in ED
- **Urinalysis and urine culture:** Pyuria may be absent due to neutropenia. Send culture regardless.
- **CXR:** Obtain in all patients. Normal CXR does not exclude pneumonia — neutropenic patients lack the neutrophils to form infiltrates.
- **CT chest:** Obtain if CXR is negative and pulmonary infection is suspected clinically; high-resolution CT detects early fungal pneumonia (halo sign, air-crescent sign)
- **CT abdomen/pelvis:** If abdominal pain — evaluate for typhlitis (cecal wall thickening >4 mm), hepatosplenic candidiasis, or other intra-abdominal source
- **Wound/catheter cultures:** Culture any suspicious skin or catheter site

**Do NOT obtain:** Rectal temperature (risk of mucosal disruption and bacteremia). Do NOT perform digital rectal exam.

## Treatment

### Empiric Antibiotics — Administer Within 60 Minutes of Triage
**Anti-pseudomonal monotherapy (choose one):**
- **Cefepime 2 g IV q8h** (preferred first-line)
- **Meropenem 1 g IV q8h** (if beta-lactam allergy is non-anaphylactic, or high ESBL risk)
- **Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h** (acceptable alternative)

**Do NOT use:** Ceftriaxone (insufficient anti-pseudomonal activity). Do NOT use fluoroquinolone monotherapy.

### Add Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV (actual body weight) for:
- Hemodynamic instability or septic shock
- Blood culture with gram-positive cocci pending identification
- Suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection
- Skin or soft tissue infection
- Known MRSA colonization
- Severe mucositis (grade 3-4)
- Pneumonia with gram-positive cocci on sputum gram stain

Discontinue vancomycin at 48-72 hours if cultures are negative for resistant gram-positives.

### Antifungal Therapy
- **Not empiric at presentation.** Add if persistent fever after 4-7 days of appropriate antibiotics without source identification.
- **Caspofungin 70 mg IV load then 50 mg IV daily** or **voriconazole 6 mg/kg IV q12h x 2 doses then 4 mg/kg IV q12h** (if Aspergillus suspected)

### Sepsis/Shock Management
- **IV crystalloid:** 30 mL/kg bolus within first 3 hours
- **Vasopressors:** Norepinephrine 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min as first-line if hypotension persists after fluid resuscitation
- **Stress-dose steroids:** Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV q6h if vasopressor-refractory shock

### G-CSF (Filgrastim)
- **NOT an emergency treatment.** Does NOT replace antibiotics and does NOT change initial ED management.
- Decision to administer is made by the oncology team based on expected duration of neutropenia and clinical trajectory.

## Disposition

- **ICU:** Septic shock, hemodynamic instability, respiratory failure, altered mental status, high-risk patients with organ dysfunction
- **Inpatient (oncology or medicine):** All high-risk patients (MASCC <21), any patient requiring IV antibiotics
- **Outpatient (rare, with strict criteria):** MASCC >=21 AND solid tumor AND expected short duration of neutropenia AND no comorbidities AND reliable follow-up within 24 hours AND able to tolerate oral medications. Oral regimen: ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO q8h + amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO q12h. Must have 4-hour observation in ED first.
- **Oncology consultation:** Required for all patients — guides ongoing management, chemotherapy adjustments, and G-CSF decisions

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for ANC results before starting antibiotics.** In a cancer patient with recent chemotherapy and fever, assume neutropenia and start empiric anti-pseudomonal therapy immediately. Door-to-antibiotic >60 minutes increases mortality.

2. **Using ceftriaxone or fluoroquinolone monotherapy.** These agents have insufficient anti-pseudomonal coverage. Pseudomonas bacteremia in a neutropenic patient is rapidly fatal. Use cefepime, meropenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam.

3. **Performing a rectal exam or obtaining a rectal temperature.** Mucosal disruption in neutropenic patients causes bacteremia. Use oral or axillary temperature. No digital rectal exams, no rectal suppositories, no enemas.

4. **Expecting a normal inflammatory response.** Neutropenic patients lack the ability to mount a white cell response. CXR may show no infiltrate despite pneumonia. Skin infections have no erythema or purulence. Urine may have no pyuria despite UTI. Treat based on clinical suspicion, not laboratory markers of inflammation.

5. **Adding vancomycin to all patients empirically.** Routine vancomycin increases nephrotoxicity and VRE selection without mortality benefit. Add only for specific indications: hemodynamic instability, catheter infection, skin/soft tissue infection, MRSA colonization, severe mucositis.

6. **Relying on G-CSF (filgrastim) as an emergency treatment.** G-CSF takes days to increase neutrophil counts. It does not substitute for empiric antibiotics and has no role in the initial ED management of febrile neutropenia.

7. **Discharging high-risk patients.** Only low-risk patients (MASCC >=21, solid tumor, short expected neutropenia, reliable follow-up) qualify for outpatient management. Hematologic malignancy patients, those with comorbidities, and patients with any hemodynamic abnormality require admission.

8. **Neglecting to draw blood cultures from all central line lumens.** Differential time-to-positivity between peripheral and central cultures identifies catheter-related bloodstream infection. Draw from each lumen separately and label them.

9. **Missing neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis).** RLQ pain in a neutropenic patient is typhlitis until proven otherwise. CT abdomen shows cecal wall thickening. Management: bowel rest, IV antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem), surgical consultation for perforation or clinical deterioration.

10. **Failing to reassess for fungal infection in persistent fever.** If fever persists >4-7 days on appropriate antibacterial therapy without an identified source, empiric antifungal therapy is indicated. Invasive Aspergillus and Candida are common in prolonged neutropenia.
