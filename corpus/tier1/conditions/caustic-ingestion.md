# Caustic Ingestion

## Recognition

### History
- Identify the substance: alkali (drain cleaner, oven cleaner, dishwasher detergent, button batteries) vs acid (toilet bowl cleaner, pool chemicals, battery acid, rust remover)
- Volume ingested, concentration, intentional vs accidental
- Time since ingestion
- Presence of solid (granular) vs liquid form — liquids cause more extensive esophageal injury; granular caustics cause more oropharyngeal injury

### Acid vs Alkali Injury Pattern
| Feature | Alkali (pH > 12) | Acid (pH < 2) |
|---|---|---|
| Mechanism | Liquefactive necrosis | Coagulative necrosis |
| Depth | Penetrating — deeper injury, ongoing | Self-limiting (coagulum forms barrier) |
| Primary site | Esophagus (prolonged contact) | Stomach (acid pools in antrum) |
| Perforation risk | Higher (esophageal) | Gastric perforation |
| Long-term risk | Esophageal stricture, esophageal carcinoma | Gastric outlet obstruction |

### Presentation
- Oropharyngeal pain, odynophagia, dysphagia, drooling
- Chest pain, epigastric pain
- Stridor, hoarseness, dysphonia (laryngeal/airway involvement)
- Vomiting (may be hematemesis)
- Oral mucosal burns (erythema, edema, white patches, ulceration) — **absence of oral burns does NOT exclude esophageal/gastric injury** (up to 30% of patients with significant internal injury have no visible oral burns)

### Red Flags — Impending Airway Compromise
- Stridor
- Drooling / inability to manage secretions
- Hoarseness or voice change
- Respiratory distress
- Oropharyngeal edema on direct inspection

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Airway assessment | Immediately — intubate early if any airway concern |
| NPO | Immediately |
| IV access, fluids, monitoring | Within minutes |
| Poison control consultation | Early |
| CT chest/abdomen | Within 1-2 hours if perforation concern |
| Endoscopy (EGD) | Within 12-24 hours |
| Surgical consultation | If perforation, full-thickness injury, or hemodynamic instability |

1. Assess and secure airway FIRST. If stridor, drooling, or oropharyngeal edema: intubate early with direct visualization (video laryngoscopy preferred). Prepare for surgical airway. Edema will worsen over hours.
2. Strict NPO. Two large-bore IV lines. Crystalloid resuscitation.
3. Do NOT induce vomiting — re-exposes esophagus to caustic.
4. Do NOT give activated charcoal — does not bind caustics, obscures endoscopy, aspiration risk.
5. Do NOT attempt neutralization (exothermic reaction worsens injury).
6. Do NOT insert NG/OG tube blindly (perforation risk through injured tissue).
7. Contact poison control (1-800-222-1222) for substance identification and guidance.
8. Obtain CT chest/abdomen with IV contrast to evaluate for perforation, mediastinitis, peritonitis.
9. Arrange endoscopy within 12-24 hours (Zargar grading guides management).

## Differential Diagnosis

- Foreign body ingestion (button battery = caustic injury mechanism; coins, sharp objects)
- Esophageal perforation from other cause (Boerhaave syndrome — post-retching)
- Anaphylaxis (airway edema without ingestion history)
- Epiglottitis (drooling, stridor, dysphagia — infectious cause)
- Pill esophagitis (doxycycline, NSAIDs, bisphosphonates — localized mucosal injury)
- Intentional self-harm with other substances (acetaminophen, other toxic co-ingestions — screen broadly)
- Thermal burn of oropharynx/esophagus (hot liquid ingestion)

## Workup

### Laboratory
- **CBC:** Baseline hemoglobin, leukocytosis (WBC > 20 suggests severe injury)
- **BMP:** Electrolytes, renal function, acid-base status
- **Lactate:** Elevated suggests tissue necrosis or perforation with sepsis
- **Coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT):** Coagulopathy suggests hepatic injury or severe tissue necrosis
- **Type and screen:** Prepare for possible surgical intervention
- **VBG/ABG:** Metabolic acidosis suggests systemic absorption (acid ingestion) or tissue necrosis
- **LFTs:** If hepatic injury suspected
- **Lipase:** If pancreatic injury suspected from acid pooling

### Imaging
- **CT chest/abdomen with IV contrast:** Evaluate for perforation (pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, free fluid), transmural injury (lack of wall enhancement), mediastinitis, peritonitis. CT grading correlates with clinical outcomes and may guide need for surgery.
- **Chest/abdominal radiograph:** Free air under diaphragm (perforation), mediastinal widening
- Do NOT obtain barium swallow acutely (aspiration risk, perforation risk)

### Endoscopy (EGD)
- Perform within 12-24 hours of ingestion (optimal window)
- Do NOT perform < 6 hours (underestimates injury) or > 48 hours (perforation risk from tissue softening)
- Contraindicated if perforation already documented on imaging

### Zargar Endoscopic Classification
| Grade | Findings | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Normal | No injury |
| 1 | Edema, erythema | Heals without sequelae |
| 2a | Superficial ulcers, exudates, hemorrhage | Low stricture risk |
| 2b | Deep or circumferential ulcers | Stricture risk 70% |
| 3a | Focal necrosis | High perforation/stricture risk |
| 3b | Extensive necrosis | Surgical intervention; mortality 65% |

### pH Testing
- Test substance pH if available (pH paper on liquid or vomitus)
- Alkali pH > 12.5: high risk for full-thickness injury
- Acid pH < 2: high risk for full-thickness injury
- Neutral pH (5-9): low risk

## Treatment

### Airway Management
- Early intubation if ANY signs of airway compromise (stridor, drooling, voice change, oropharyngeal edema)
- Video laryngoscopy preferred for visualization of edematous anatomy
- Have surgical airway equipment at bedside (cricothyrotomy kit)
- Awake intubation if patient is cooperative and airway anatomy is distorted
- Avoid blind nasal intubation (nasal/oropharyngeal tissue may be friable)

### Supportive Care
- NPO — no oral fluids, no dilution attempts
- IV crystalloid resuscitation (LR or NS)
- Pain management: fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV q1h PRN or morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q4h PRN
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV for nausea (do NOT allow vomiting — re-exposure)
- Foley catheter for strict I/O monitoring

### Medications
- **PPI:** Pantoprazole 40 mg IV BID for acid injury (reduces ongoing acid contact with damaged mucosa)
- **Antibiotics:** Only if perforation documented or high-grade injury (Zargar 3). Broad-spectrum: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q8h or meropenem 1 g IV q8h.
- **Steroids: NOT recommended.** Multiple studies show no benefit in preventing strictures and may increase infection and perforation risk.
- **Sucralfate:** No proven benefit; do not use acutely.

### Contraindicated Interventions
- Do NOT induce vomiting (re-exposes esophagus)
- Do NOT give activated charcoal (ineffective, obscures endoscopy)
- Do NOT attempt neutralization (exothermic reaction causes thermal injury superimposed on chemical injury)
- Do NOT insert NG tube blindly (perforation risk)
- Do NOT give ipecac

### Surgical Management
- **Emergent indications:** Free perforation (pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum), peritonitis, mediastinitis, hemodynamic instability unresponsive to resuscitation, Zargar grade 3b
- Surgical options: esophagectomy, gastrectomy, or resection of necrotic segments
- Early surgical consultation for all grade 2b and above injuries

### Button Battery Ingestion (Special Case)
- Generates hydroxide ions at negative pole — creates alkali injury
- Esophageal button battery: emergent removal (endoscopy within 2 hours)
- Honey 10 mL PO q10min (if ≥1 year old) and sucralfate 10 mL PO q10min while awaiting removal — shown to reduce injury severity (2018 NBIH consensus)
- Post-removal: observe for delayed complications (aortoesophageal fistula — can present days to weeks later with sentinel bleed followed by massive hemorrhage)

## Disposition

### ICU Admission
- Airway compromise or intubation
- Hemodynamic instability
- Documented perforation
- Zargar grade 2b or higher
- Large-volume intentional ingestion
- Metabolic acidosis or coagulopathy

### Ward Admission
- All caustic ingestions require admission for observation and endoscopy within 12-24 hours
- Zargar grade 1-2a: admit for observation, advance diet gradually if endoscopy reassuring
- Psychiatry consultation for intentional ingestion before discharge

### Discharge
- Rarely appropriate from ED. Only if: accidental taste/sip of low-concentration product, completely asymptomatic, normal oropharyngeal exam, neutral pH substance, observed 4-6 hours with no symptoms
- Follow-up within 24-48 hours

### Long-Term Complications (Communicate to Admitting Team)
- Esophageal stricture (develops 2-8 weeks post-injury, grade 2b+)
- Esophageal carcinoma (increased risk, onset 15-40 years post-ingestion)
- Gastric outlet obstruction (acid injuries)
- Aortoesophageal fistula (button battery — delayed, catastrophic)

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming no oral burns = no internal injury.** Up to 30% of patients with significant esophageal or gastric injury have no visible oropharyngeal burns. All intentional ingestions and symptomatic patients require endoscopy regardless of oral exam findings.

2. **Delaying intubation in a patient with stridor or drooling.** Airway edema from caustic injury worsens progressively over hours. Early intubation with direct visualization is far safer than emergent cricothyrotomy after complete airway obstruction.

3. **Giving activated charcoal.** Charcoal does not adsorb caustic agents, obscures endoscopic visualization, and increases aspiration risk in patients with impaired airway protection.

4. **Attempting neutralization (e.g., giving vinegar for alkali or bicarbonate for acid).** The exothermic neutralization reaction produces heat, adding thermal injury to chemical injury. This is absolutely contraindicated.

5. **Inserting a nasogastric tube blindly.** Passage of NG/OG tube through caustic-injured esophageal tissue risks perforation. If gastric decontamination is needed (co-ingestion), defer to endoscopy team.

6. **Inducing vomiting.** Emesis re-exposes the esophagus to the caustic substance, doubling the mucosal contact and injury.

7. **Administering systemic corticosteroids to prevent stricture.** Multiple studies (including meta-analyses) show no benefit of steroids in preventing esophageal stricture formation. Steroids increase infection risk and may mask signs of perforation.

8. **Performing endoscopy too early (< 6 hours) or too late (> 48 hours).** Before 6 hours, injury may be underestimated as necrosis has not fully declared. After 48 hours, tissue softening increases perforation risk during endoscopy.

9. **Failing to screen for co-ingestion in intentional cases.** Suicidal caustic ingestions frequently involve co-ingested medications (acetaminophen, other pills). Obtain APAP level, salicylate level, and comprehensive toxicology screen.

10. **Not recognizing button battery ingestion as a caustic emergency.** Esophageal button batteries generate alkali injury within 2 hours. Emergent removal is required. Delayed complications include aortoesophageal fistula weeks later.
