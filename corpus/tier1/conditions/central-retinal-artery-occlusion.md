# Central Retinal Artery Occlusion

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute occlusion of the central retinal artery causing sudden, painless, monocular vision loss. The retina is end-organ tissue supplied by the central retinal artery (branch of the ophthalmic artery, from the internal carotid). CRAO is a stroke equivalent — the retina is brain tissue.

**Pathophysiology:**
- Embolism (most common): carotid atherosclerosis, cardiac emboli (atrial fibrillation, valvular disease), aortic arch atheroma
- Thrombosis in situ
- Dissection of internal carotid or ophthalmic artery
- Vasculitis: giant cell arteritis (GCA) — must be excluded in all patients > 50 years
- Hypercoagulable states: especially in young patients without traditional vascular risk factors

**Presentation:**
- Sudden, painless, monocular vision loss — typically profound (counting fingers or light perception only)
- Onset within seconds to minutes
- May report transient monocular vision loss (amaurosis fugax) in preceding days/weeks (30%)
- No pain (pain suggests alternative diagnosis: acute angle closure, optic neuritis, temporal arteritis with associated headache)

**Exam Findings:**
- Visual acuity: markedly reduced (counting fingers, hand motion, light perception)
- Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD / Marcus Gunn pupil) — present unless bilateral
- Fundoscopy:
  - Retinal whitening/pallor (edematous, ischemic retina)
  - Cherry-red spot at the macula (fovea appears red against pale retina because it is thin enough to show underlying choroidal circulation)
  - Attenuated (narrowed) retinal arterioles
  - Cattle-trucking (segmentation of blood column in arterioles)
  - Emboli visible in 20% (Hollenhorst plaques = cholesterol; calcific = valvular; fibrin-platelet)
- Note: fundoscopic findings may take 1-2 hours to develop. A normal-appearing fundus in the first hour does not exclude CRAO.

**Key Point:** CRAO is a stroke equivalent. These patients have a 30% risk of stroke or MI within 1 week.

## Critical Actions

1. **Recognize the diagnosis immediately** — sudden, painless monocular vision loss with RAPD = CRAO until proven otherwise. Time is retina.
2. **Determine symptom onset** — treatment window is narrow (< 4.5 hours for thrombolysis consideration; retinal damage begins at 90 minutes).
3. **Exclude giant cell arteritis** — in ALL patients ≥ 50 years: ask about headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness, weight loss, polymyalgia symptoms. Check ESR and CRP immediately. If GCA suspected, start methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily before biopsy confirmation.
4. **Emergent ophthalmology and neurology/stroke team consultation** — CRAO is now increasingly managed as an acute stroke with potential for thrombolysis or intra-arterial therapy at specialized centers.
5. **Stroke workup** — carotid imaging, echocardiography, ECG, hypercoagulable labs in young patients. These patients need full acute stroke evaluation.
6. **Attempt temporizing measures** (low evidence but low risk): ocular massage, anterior chamber paracentesis (ophthalmology), sublingual nitroglycerin — while awaiting definitive intervention.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) | Painless vision loss (less acute), dilated tortuous veins, widespread retinal hemorrhages, disc edema — NOT pale retina |
| Optic neuritis | Pain with eye movement, younger patient, gradual onset over hours-days, color desaturation, MRI shows optic nerve enhancement |
| Giant cell arteritis (arteritic CRAO) | Age > 50, headache, jaw claudication, elevated ESR/CRP, bilateral vision loss possible |
| Acute angle closure glaucoma | Severe eye PAIN, mid-dilated fixed pupil, injected conjunctiva, elevated IOP, halos |
| Retinal detachment | Curtain/shadow in visual field, floaters, flashes, relative preservation of central vision initially, no RAPD unless extensive |
| Vitreous hemorrhage | Sudden vision loss, unable to visualize fundus through hemorrhage, history of diabetes/trauma |
| Ophthalmic artery occlusion | More severe than CRAO; both retinal and choroidal circulation affected; no cherry-red spot (choroid also ischemic) |
| Transient ischemic attack (resolved) | Vision returned to normal; same workup indicated |

## Workup

**Emergent (in ED):**
- Visual acuity (each eye)
- Pupil exam (RAPD)
- Slit lamp exam and fundoscopy (dilated)
- Intraocular pressure measurement
- ESR and CRP — mandatory in all patients ≥ 50 years (rule out GCA; ESR > 50 mm/hr and CRP > 5 mg/L highly suggestive)
- Point-of-care glucose
- CBC, BMP
- Coagulation studies (PT/INR, PTT)
- ECG (atrial fibrillation, ischemia)
- Troponin (concurrent MI)

**Urgent (within hours):**
- Carotid duplex ultrasound or CTA head/neck (carotid stenosis, dissection)
- Echocardiography (TTE; TEE if high suspicion for cardiac emboli)
- MRI/MRA brain (concurrent cerebral ischemia — present in 25% of CRAO patients)

**In Young Patients (< 50 years, no vascular risk factors):**
- Hypercoagulable panel: antiphospholipid antibodies, factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C/S, antithrombin III, homocysteine
- RPR/VDRL
- Consider toxicology screen (cocaine-induced vasospasm)

**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** Retinal edema consistent with acute ischemia. Useful for diagnosis and monitoring.

## Treatment

**Traditional Temporizing Measures (low evidence, used while awaiting definitive therapy):**
- **Ocular massage:** intermittent digital pressure on the globe through closed eyelid (10-15 seconds on, 10-15 seconds off) for 5-15 minutes. Goal: mechanically dislodge embolus distally.
- **Anterior chamber paracentesis:** performed by ophthalmology — 0.1-0.2 mL aqueous humor removed with 27-30 gauge needle. Acutely lowers IOP, creating a pressure gradient favoring perfusion.
- **IOP-lowering agents:** timolol 0.5% 1 drop topically, acetazolamide 500 mg IV — reduce IOP to improve retinal perfusion pressure.
- **Sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL** — systemic vasodilation.
- **Carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2) inhalation** — retinal arteriolar dilation. Limited availability.
- Evidence for all traditional measures is weak; none have demonstrated improved outcomes in controlled trials.

**Thrombolysis (emerging standard at stroke centers):**
- **IV alteplase (tPA) 0.9 mg/kg IV (max 90 mg)** — 10% as bolus, remainder over 60 minutes. Same protocol as acute ischemic stroke. Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Increasing evidence supports treating CRAO as a stroke equivalent.
- **Intra-arterial thrombolysis:** selective catheterization of ophthalmic artery with tPA infusion. Available at interventional neuroradiology centers. May be offered within 6-8 hours at experienced centers.
- Contraindications: same as stroke thrombolysis (recent surgery, active bleeding, INR > 1.7, platelet count < 100,000)
- Decision to lyse should involve neurology/stroke team and ophthalmology jointly.

**Giant Cell Arteritis (if suspected or confirmed):**
- Methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 days, then prednisone 1 mg/kg PO daily (max 80 mg)
- Do NOT wait for temporal artery biopsy to start steroids — biopsy remains positive for 2 weeks after steroid initiation
- Temporal artery biopsy within 2 weeks (arrange as inpatient or urgent outpatient)
- Protects the contralateral eye from involvement

**Secondary Prevention:**
- Antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 325 mg PO daily (initiate in ED if thrombolysis not pursued)
- Statin therapy: atorvastatin 80 mg PO daily for atherosclerotic etiology
- Anticoagulation with heparin drip, then warfarin or DOAC if atrial fibrillation or cardiac emboli confirmed
- Aggressive vascular risk factor management (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking cessation)

## Disposition

**Admission (most CRAO patients):**
- Stroke unit / telemetry admission for acute CRAO (stroke-equivalent monitoring)
- Complete stroke workup (carotid imaging, echocardiography, telemetry for 24-48 hours)
- Post-thrombolysis monitoring if tPA administered (ICU or stroke unit per protocol)
- GCA with CRAO: admission for IV methylprednisolone and monitoring of contralateral eye

**Transfer to Stroke Center:**
- If presenting facility does not have stroke team, interventional neuroradiology, or ophthalmology
- Within treatment window (< 4.5 hours for IV tPA, < 6-8 hours for IA therapy)
- Do not delay transfer for extensive ED workup

**Outpatient (rare — only if):**
- Symptom onset > 24 hours ago (treatment window passed)
- Full stroke workup already completed
- Ophthalmology and neurology follow-up confirmed within 24-48 hours
- Antiplatelet and statin therapy initiated
- Educated on stroke risk and warning signs

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to recognize CRAO as a stroke equivalent.** The retina is CNS tissue. CRAO patients have a 30% risk of stroke or MI within 1 week. Full acute stroke evaluation (carotid imaging, ECG, echocardiography, telemetry) is mandatory. Treating CRAO as an isolated ophthalmologic problem misses the systemic vascular emergency.

2. **Not checking ESR/CRP in patients over 50.** Giant cell arteritis causes arteritic CRAO and threatens the contralateral eye with permanent bilateral blindness. ESR and CRP must be obtained in every patient ≥ 50 years. If GCA is suspected clinically (headache, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness), start methylprednisolone 1 g IV immediately — do not wait for biopsy.

3. **Delayed recognition because fundus looks normal.** The classic cherry-red spot and retinal pallor take 1-2 hours to develop. In the hyperacute phase, the fundus may appear normal. Diagnose on clinical grounds: sudden painless monocular vision loss + RAPD = CRAO. Do not wait for textbook fundoscopic findings.

4. **Treating CRAO only with traditional measures.** Ocular massage and anterior chamber paracentesis have no proven efficacy in controlled trials. Emerging evidence supports IV thrombolysis for CRAO within 4.5 hours, analogous to acute ischemic stroke. Consult neurology/stroke team early for thrombolysis candidacy.

5. **Missing the treatment window by prolonged ED workup.** Retinal ischemia begins at 90 minutes and is typically irreversible by 4-6 hours. Extended ED evaluations, delays in ophthalmology consultation, or transfer delays waste the narrow treatment window. Time is retina — parallel processing.

6. **Confusing CRAO with CRVO.** Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) also causes sudden monocular vision loss, but presents with widespread retinal hemorrhages, dilated tortuous veins, and disc edema. CRAO shows a pale retina with cherry-red spot. The workup, treatment, and prognosis differ significantly.

7. **Discharging without secondary prevention.** CRAO patients who do not receive antiplatelet therapy, statin, and vascular risk factor management are at high risk for subsequent stroke and MI. Aspirin 325 mg PO and atorvastatin 80 mg PO should be initiated in the ED before discharge if admission is not possible.

8. **Forgetting to evaluate young patients for hypercoagulable states.** CRAO in patients < 50 years without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors warrants evaluation for antiphospholipid syndrome, factor V Leiden, protein C/S deficiency, and other thrombophilias. Cocaine use causing vasospasm is another missed etiology.
