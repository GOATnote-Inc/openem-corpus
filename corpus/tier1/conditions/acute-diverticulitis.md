# Acute Diverticulitis

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Left lower quadrant (LLQ) pain — gradual onset over hours to days
- Low-grade fever
- Change in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)
- Nausea, anorexia
- Urinary symptoms if inflammation adjacent to bladder (dysuria, frequency)

**Complicated vs uncomplicated:**
- **Uncomplicated (75%):** localized inflammation without abscess, perforation, fistula, or obstruction
- **Complicated (25%):** abscess, perforation (free or contained), fistula (colovesical, colovaginal), obstruction, stricture

**Hinchey classification (for complicated):**
- I: pericolic/mesenteric abscess
- II: pelvic or distant abscess
- III: purulent peritonitis (perforated)
- IV: fecal peritonitis (perforated)

**Exam findings:**
- LLQ tenderness with or without palpable mass (phlegmon)
- Low-grade fever (high fever suggests complicated disease)
- Peritoneal signs (guarding, rebound) suggest perforation
- Right-sided diverticulitis: RLQ pain (more common in Asian populations, younger patients) — mimics appendicitis

## Critical Actions

1. **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast** — confirm diagnosis, stage severity, exclude complications
2. **Assess for complicated disease** (abscess, perforation, obstruction)
3. **NPO if vomiting or complicated disease; clear liquids for uncomplicated**
4. **Antibiotics for complicated disease, immunocompromised, or severe presentation:**
   - Outpatient: ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID + metronidazole 500 mg PO TID x 7-10 days; OR amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID
   - Inpatient: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
5. **Uncomplicated diverticulitis in immunocompetent patients: antibiotics may be selectively withheld** (AGA recommendation)
6. **Surgical consultation** for Hinchey III/IV, failed medical management, or obstruction
7. **IR consultation for percutaneous drainage** of abscess > 3-4 cm

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Colorectal carcinoma** — weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, age > 50 with new symptoms; colonoscopy after resolution
- **Ischemic colitis** — bloody diarrhea, watershed distribution on CT, elderly with vascular disease
- **Acute appendicitis** — RLQ pain (right-sided diverticulitis mimics); CT distinguishes
- **Ovarian pathology** — ovarian cyst rupture, torsion, tubo-ovarian abscess; pelvic US or CT
- **Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn)** — younger patients, chronic/recurrent symptoms, skip lesions
- **Urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis** — dysuria, pyuria, CVA tenderness; UA and cultures
- **Sigmoid volvulus** — massive distension, coffee-bean sign on X-ray

## Workup

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (gold standard):**
  - Sensitivity 94%, specificity 99%
  - Pericolonic fat stranding, bowel wall thickening (> 4 mm), diverticula
  - Abscess (rim-enhancing fluid collection)
  - Free air (perforation)
  - Oral contrast: optional; IV contrast most important
- **Labs:** CBC (leukocytosis), BMP, CRP (> 140 mg/L predicts complicated disease), lactate (if sepsis suspected), urinalysis (exclude UTI, assess for pyuria from colovesical fistula)
- **Do NOT perform colonoscopy acutely** — perforation risk; schedule 6-8 weeks after resolution to exclude malignancy (especially age > 40 or atypical features)
- **Abdominal X-ray:** limited utility; may show ileus, free air (if perforated)
- **Pelvic US:** if ovarian/gynecologic pathology on differential

## Treatment

**Uncomplicated, immunocompetent, mild symptoms:**
- Selective antibiotic use (AGA recommendation — antibiotics may be withheld)
- Clear liquid diet advancing as tolerated
- Acetaminophen 1 g PO q6h for pain (avoid NSAIDs — perforation risk)
- Follow-up in 2-3 days to confirm improvement
- If antibiotics used: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID x 7-10 days OR ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID + metronidazole 500 mg PO TID x 7-10 days

**Complicated — abscess (Hinchey I/II):**
- < 3 cm abscess: IV antibiotics alone (piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h)
- ≥ 3-4 cm abscess: CT-guided percutaneous drainage + IV antibiotics
- Duration: IV antibiotics until improving, then transition to PO for total 10-14 days

**Complicated — perforation (Hinchey III/IV):**
- Emergent surgical consultation
- IV antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation
- Hinchey III: laparoscopic lavage (controversial) or Hartmann procedure
- Hinchey IV: Hartmann procedure (sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy)
- Primary anastomosis with diverting ileostomy in selected stable patients

**Post-episode management:**
- Colonoscopy 6-8 weeks after resolution (exclude malignancy)
- High-fiber diet after acute phase resolves
- Elective sigmoid colectomy: considered after complicated diverticulitis or in immunocompromised patients (not routinely after uncomplicated episodes per AGA)

## Disposition

- **Discharge (uncomplicated, immunocompetent):**
  - Tolerating PO, pain controlled, no high-risk features
  - Clear follow-up in 2-3 days
  - Return precautions: worsening pain, fever, inability to tolerate PO, rectal bleeding
- **Admit:** complicated disease (abscess, perforation, obstruction), unable to tolerate PO, failed outpatient management, immunocompromised (steroids, chemotherapy, transplant), significant comorbidities, unreliable follow-up
- **ICU:** peritonitis (Hinchey III/IV), sepsis, hemodynamic instability

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing colorectal cancer.** Up to 2-5% of patients initially diagnosed with diverticulitis on CT are found to have colorectal cancer on follow-up colonoscopy. Colonoscopy 6-8 weeks after resolution is mandatory, especially for age > 40, first episode, or atypical features.

2. **Right-sided diverticulitis misdiagnosed as appendicitis.** Right-sided diverticulitis is common in Asian populations and younger patients. CT is essential to distinguish from appendicitis. Surgical approach differs.

3. **Prescribing NSAIDs for pain.** NSAIDs increase the risk of diverticular perforation. Use acetaminophen for analgesia. Opioids are acceptable short-term but constipation may worsen disease.

4. **Routine antibiotics for all uncomplicated diverticulitis.** AGA guidelines recommend selective antibiotic use in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated disease. Randomized trials (AVOD, DIABOLO) show no difference in outcomes with observation alone.

5. **Performing colonoscopy during acute diverticulitis.** Colonoscopy during the acute phase increases perforation risk. Wait 6-8 weeks for inflammation to resolve.

6. **Draining small abscesses unnecessarily.** Abscesses < 3 cm typically respond to antibiotics alone. Percutaneous drainage is reserved for collections ≥ 3-4 cm.
