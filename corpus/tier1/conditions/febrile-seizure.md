# Febrile Seizure

## Recognition

**Definition:** Seizure occurring in a febrile child (temp ≥ 38°C / 100.4°F) aged 6 months to 5 years, without CNS infection, metabolic derangement, or history of afebrile seizures.

**Classification:**
- **Simple febrile seizure (70-75%):** generalized tonic-clonic, duration < 15 minutes, does not recur within 24 hours, child returns to neurologic baseline
- **Complex febrile seizure (25-30%):** focal features, duration ≥ 15 minutes, recurs within 24 hours, or incomplete recovery (post-ictal Todd paralysis)

**Epidemiology:**
- 2-5% of children aged 6 months to 5 years
- Peak incidence 12-18 months
- Male predominance (1.6:1)
- 30-35% recurrence after first febrile seizure
- Family history in 25-40%

**Risk Factors for Recurrence:**
- First febrile seizure before age 18 months
- Lower peak temperature at time of seizure
- Shorter duration of fever before seizure (seizure early in illness)
- Family history of febrile seizures
- Frequent febrile illnesses (daycare attendance)

**Presentation:**
- Generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a febrile child
- Typically brief (< 5 min), self-limited
- Post-ictal drowsiness (minutes to hours; should be improving)
- Fever from any source: viral URI (most common), otitis media, roseola (HHV-6), UTI, gastroenteritis, pneumonia
- Seizure may be the first sign of fever (parents unaware of fever)

## Critical Actions

1. **ABCs** — maintain airway, position lateral (recovery position), suction if needed. Do NOT place anything in the mouth.
2. **Actively seizing > 5 minutes — treat as status epilepticus:**
   - Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IM (max 10 mg) or 0.2 mg/kg intranasal (max 10 mg)
   - Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg rectal (max 20 mg)
   - Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg) if IV access established
3. **Identify the fever source** — thorough exam for meningitis, UTI, otitis media, pneumonia, bacteremia. The seizure is not the diagnosis; the fever source is.
4. **Assess for meningitis** — in children < 12 months, meningeal signs are unreliable. Low threshold for LP in: < 12 months (especially if unimmunized or on antibiotics), complex febrile seizure, prolonged post-ictal state, meningeal signs, petechial rash, toxic-appearing.
5. **Check glucose** — dextrose 10% (D10) 5 mL/kg IV if hypoglycemic (< 60 mg/dL in children).
6. **Treat fever** — acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO/PR or ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO. Antipyretics do not prevent febrile seizure recurrence but treat discomfort.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Meningitis/encephalitis | Toxic appearance, bulging fontanelle, nuchal rigidity, petechiae, persistent altered mental status, CSF pleocytosis |
| Epilepsy | Afebrile seizures, recurrent unprovoked seizures, abnormal EEG |
| Febrile status epilepticus | Febrile seizure lasting > 30 minutes — requires aggressive treatment and workup |
| Shigella gastroenteritis | Seizure with diarrheal illness, often before fever; stool studies |
| Electrolyte abnormality | Hyponatremia (excessive free water), hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia — BMP diagnostic |
| Drug ingestion/toxicity | Accidental ingestion, toxicology screen, pupil exam, history |
| Intracranial mass | Focal seizure, focal deficits, papilledema, progressive symptoms |
| HHV-6 (roseola) | Classic presentation: high fever followed by rash; very common trigger of febrile seizures |

## Workup

**Simple Febrile Seizure in a Well-Appearing Child > 12 Months:**
- Identify fever source (clinical exam)
- Point-of-care glucose
- Routine labs, LP, neuroimaging, and EEG are NOT recommended (AAP 2011)
- Focused testing for fever source: UA/UCx if no clear source (especially < 2 years), CXR if respiratory symptoms, rapid strep if pharyngitis

**Indications for Lumbar Puncture:**
- Age 6-12 months: LP strongly recommended if Hib or pneumococcal immunization status is incomplete or unknown
- Age 12-18 months: LP should be performed if meningeal signs present or clinical suspicion exists
- Any age: meningeal signs, petechial rash, toxic appearance, prolonged altered mental status, complex seizure with incomplete recovery, pretreated with antibiotics (may mask meningitis)

**Complex Febrile Seizure:**
- Labs: CBC, BMP (glucose, sodium, calcium), blood culture
- LP: lower threshold, especially if prolonged post-ictal state, focal seizure, or multiple recurrences within 24 hours
- Neuroimaging: MRI (preferred, non-emergent) for prolonged febrile seizures (> 15 min) or focal features; emergent CT if concern for mass/hemorrhage
- EEG: not emergently indicated; outpatient EEG if recurrent complex febrile seizures

## Treatment

**Acute Seizure Management (if actively seizing in ED):**
- Position on side, suction airway, apply O2
- Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IM (max 10 mg) — fastest IM onset
- Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg intranasal via mucosal atomizer (max 10 mg)
- Diazepam 0.5 mg/kg PR (max 20 mg) — preferred rectal option
- Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV (max 4 mg) — if IV access available
- If seizure continues after 2 benzodiazepine doses: levetiracetam 40-60 mg/kg IV (max 4500 mg) over 15 min, or fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV (max 1500 mg PE) over 10-20 min

**Fever Management:**
- Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO or PR q4h (max 75 mg/kg/day)
- Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO q6h (age > 6 months; max 40 mg/kg/day)
- Tepid sponge bath (adjunctive only)
- Antipyretics reduce discomfort but do NOT prevent recurrence of febrile seizures (AAP 2008)

**Treat the Underlying Fever Source:**
- Antibiotics as indicated for identified bacterial infection (UTI, AOM, pneumonia)
- Do not delay antibiotics if meningitis is suspected — ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV (max 2 g) + vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV before LP results

**Prophylactic Antiepileptic Therapy:**
- NOT recommended for simple febrile seizures (AAP 2008)
- Daily antiepileptics (phenobarbital, valproate) are effective at preventing recurrence but adverse effects outweigh benefits given the benign nature of simple febrile seizures
- Intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg PO q8h during febrile illness) can reduce recurrence but is not routinely recommended due to sedation

## Disposition

**Discharge (majority of simple febrile seizures):**
- Child has returned to neurologic baseline (alert, interactive, age-appropriate behavior)
- Fever source identified and treated (or no serious bacterial source after evaluation)
- Parents educated on:
  - Febrile seizures do not cause brain damage or epilepsy (risk of epilepsy: 1-2% vs. 1% general population)
  - Recurrence risk (30-35% after first episode)
  - Seizure first aid (lateral position, do not put anything in mouth, time the seizure, call 911 if > 5 min)
  - Fever management with acetaminophen/ibuprofen
  - Return for: seizure > 5 min, repeated seizures, persistent lethargy, stiff neck, petechial rash, not feeding

**Observation/Admission:**
- Complex febrile seizure (focal, prolonged, recurrent within 24 hours)
- Febrile status epilepticus
- Ongoing post-ictal state > 30-60 minutes
- Concern for meningitis or encephalitis (pending LP, antibiotics initiated)
- Toxic-appearing child
- Uncertain diagnosis
- Unreliable follow-up / caregiver concern

**ICU Admission:**
- Febrile status epilepticus requiring ongoing anticonvulsant infusion
- Meningitis/encephalitis confirmed or strongly suspected
- Hemodynamic instability

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing meningitis.** Meningeal signs (nuchal rigidity, Kernig, Brudzinski) are unreliable in children < 12 months. A well-appearing child after a simple febrile seizure rarely has meningitis, but a persistently lethargic, toxic, or irritable child requires LP regardless of age. Pretreating with antibiotics before presentation masks CSF findings.

2. **Over-investigating simple febrile seizures.** AAP guidelines do not recommend routine labs, neuroimaging, or EEG for simple febrile seizures. Unnecessary head CTs expose children to radiation and sedation risk. The workup is for the fever source, not the seizure.

3. **Telling parents the child has epilepsy.** Febrile seizures are NOT epilepsy. The risk of developing epilepsy after a simple febrile seizure is 1-2% (barely above baseline). Mislabeling creates unnecessary anxiety, medication exposure, and activity restrictions.

4. **Prescribing prophylactic anticonvulsants.** Daily phenobarbital or valproate prevents recurrence but causes sedation, behavioral changes, and hepatotoxicity. AAP guidelines explicitly recommend against prophylactic antiepileptic drugs for simple febrile seizures. The benefit-risk ratio does not favor treatment.

5. **Failing to check glucose.** Hypoglycemia causes seizures in children and is rapidly correctable. A bedside glucose takes seconds and excludes a treatable emergency.

6. **Not treating the seizure that does not stop.** Most febrile seizures self-terminate in < 3 minutes. When a seizure continues beyond 5 minutes, it is unlikely to stop spontaneously and requires benzodiazepine treatment. Waiting and watching beyond 5 minutes allows progression to status epilepticus.

7. **Assuming the fever source is viral without evaluation.** UTIs in febrile infants and toddlers are common, often without localizing symptoms, and are easily missed without urinalysis. Febrile children < 2 years without a clear source need a UA. Occult bacteremia, though rare in the post-PCV13 era, still occurs.

8. **Discharging before return to baseline.** Post-ictal drowsiness after a simple febrile seizure should improve progressively over 15-30 minutes. A child who remains lethargic or irritable beyond 60 minutes post-seizure requires reassessment for meningitis, complex seizure, or other pathology. Do not discharge a child who is not at neurologic baseline.
