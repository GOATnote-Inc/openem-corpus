# Urolithiasis (Renal Colic)

## Recognition

### Classic Presentation
- Acute onset of severe, colicky flank pain radiating to ipsilateral groin, labia, or testicle
- Pain follows ureteral course: flank → lateral abdomen → groin → genitalia
- Patient cannot find a comfortable position (writhes in pain — distinguishes from peritonitis where patients lie still)
- Nausea and vomiting (common due to shared autonomic innervation with GI tract)
- Urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria (distal ureteral or UVJ stones)
- Hematuria: present in 85-90% — **absence does NOT exclude diagnosis** (10-15% have no hematuria)

### Stone Location and Symptoms
| Location | Typical Symptoms |
|---|---|
| Renal pelvis / UPJ | Deep flank pain, CVA tenderness |
| Mid-ureter | Pain radiating to lower abdomen |
| Distal ureter / UVJ | Groin/genital pain, urgency, frequency |
| Bladder | Suprapubic pain, dysuria |

### Red Flags Suggesting Complicated Stone
- Fever + obstructing stone = **infected stone / obstructive pyelonephritis / urosepsis** — urologic emergency
- Anuria or oliguria (bilateral obstruction or solitary kidney)
- Sepsis criteria (tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Pain control | Immediately — ketorolac 30 mg IV first-line |
| Urinalysis | At triage |
| CT non-contrast abdomen/pelvis | Within 1-2 hours of presentation |
| BMP + creatinine | All patients |
| Blood cultures + IV antibiotics | If fever or suspected infected stone |
| Emergent urology consultation | Infected obstructing stone, bilateral obstruction, solitary kidney, AKI |

1. Aggressive pain management: ketorolac 30 mg IV (15 mg if ≥65 years, renal insufficiency, or <50 kg), repeat in 6 hours if needed
2. Obtain CT non-contrast abdomen/pelvis (low-dose protocol acceptable)
3. Send UA, BMP, CBC
4. If fever or pyuria with obstruction: obtain blood cultures, start IV antibiotics (piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV or cefepime 2 g IV), and consult urology for emergent decompression
5. Assess stone size and location to guide disposition

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm** (age >60, cardiovascular risk factors, pulsatile abdominal mass, hemodynamic instability — obtain bedside POCUS aorta in all patients >50 with first-episode flank pain)
- Renal artery dissection or infarction (atrial fibrillation, history of endovascular procedure, persistent severe flank pain with LDH elevation)
- Mesenteric ischemia (age >60, atrial fibrillation, pain out of proportion, lactic acidosis)
- Pyelonephritis (fever, pyuria, bacteriuria, no stone on imaging)
- Appendicitis (right-sided — periumbilical pain migrating to RLQ, anorexia)
- Ectopic pregnancy (reproductive-age female — obtain beta-hCG)
- Ovarian torsion (female, sudden onset pelvic pain, nausea)
- Diverticulitis (left-sided — fever, LLQ tenderness, CT findings)
- Musculoskeletal pain (positional, reproducible with palpation)
- Herpes zoster (dermatomal, vesicular rash — may precede rash)

## Workup

### Imaging
- **CT non-contrast abdomen/pelvis:** Gold standard. Sensitivity >95%, specificity >98%. Determines stone size, location, number, hydronephrosis, and alternate diagnoses. Low-dose CT reduces radiation with preserved sensitivity.
- **Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS):** First-line in pregnancy, pediatrics, and young patients with prior stone history. Sensitivity 45% for ureteral stones but detects hydronephrosis (sensitivity 72-87%). Does NOT reliably determine stone size or exact location.
- **KUB plain radiograph:** Low sensitivity (45-59%). Useful only for monitoring known radiopaque stones.

### Laboratory
- **Urinalysis:** Hematuria (microscopic or gross) supports diagnosis but absent in 10-15%. Pyuria + bacteriuria with obstruction = infected stone.
- **BMP/creatinine:** Assess renal function; identify AKI from obstruction
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis with left shift suggests infection
- **Lactate:** If sepsis suspected
- **Urine culture:** If pyuria present
- **Beta-hCG:** All women of reproductive age
- **Type and screen:** If surgical intervention anticipated

### Stone Size and Spontaneous Passage Rates
| Stone Size | Spontaneous Passage Rate | Average Time |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 2 mm | 97% | 8 days |
| 3-4 mm | 80% | 12 days |
| 5 mm | 68% | 22 days |
| 6-7 mm | 47% | — |
| 8-9 mm | 25% | — |
| > 10 mm | Unlikely (<10%) | Intervention required |

## Treatment

### Pain Management
- **Ketorolac 30 mg IV** (15 mg if ≥65, renal impairment, or <50 kg): First-line. NSAIDs are equivalent or superior to opioids for renal colic in multiple RCTs.
- **Ibuprofen 800 mg PO** if IV not needed
- **Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV** or **hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV:** For refractory pain or NSAID contraindication
- **Lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes:** Emerging evidence for refractory renal colic
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV:** For nausea/vomiting
- **IV normal saline:** Hydration for comfort; forced IV fluids do NOT accelerate stone passage and may worsen pain from hydronephrosis

### Medical Expulsive Therapy (MET)
- **Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO daily** for distal ureteral stones 5-10 mm
- NNT approximately 4-5 for facilitating stone passage
- Benefit most established for distal ureteral stones 5-10 mm; benefit for smaller stones debated (2018 AUA re-analysis supports use)
- Duration: up to 4-6 weeks or until stone passes
- Side effects: orthostatic hypotension, retrograde ejaculation

### Infected Obstructing Stone (Urologic Emergency)
- **Do NOT attempt to pass the stone medically** — this is a surgical emergency
- IV antibiotics immediately: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q8h or cefepime 2 g IV q8h
- Emergent urology consultation for decompression: percutaneous nephrostomy tube or ureteral stent placement
- Vasopressors as needed for septic shock
- ICU admission

## Disposition

### Discharge Criteria (Most Patients)
- Pain controlled with oral medications
- Tolerating PO fluids
- Stone ≤ 10 mm without signs of infection
- Normal renal function (or stable baseline)
- Reliable follow-up with urology within 1-2 weeks
- Prescribe: ketorolac 10 mg PO q6h PRN x 5 days or ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6h, oxycodone 5 mg PO q4h PRN breakthrough, ondansetron 4 mg SL q8h PRN, tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO daily (if stone 5-10 mm), urine strainer

### Admission Criteria
- Infected obstructing stone (pyuria + obstruction ± fever ± sepsis)
- Intractable pain despite IV analgesia
- Intractable vomiting (unable to tolerate PO)
- Acute kidney injury (creatinine rise >0.3 mg/dL or >50% above baseline)
- Solitary kidney with obstructing stone
- Bilateral obstructing stones
- Stone > 10 mm unlikely to pass
- Pregnancy with obstructing stone and uncontrolled symptoms

### Return Precautions
- Fever, chills, rigors
- Worsening or uncontrolled pain
- Inability to tolerate PO fluids
- Decreased urine output

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to consider ruptured AAA in patients >50 with first-episode "renal colic."** A leaking AAA mimics renal colic precisely. Obtain bedside POCUS of the aorta in any patient >50 with first-time flank pain, especially with hemodynamic instability, back pain, or absence of hematuria.

2. **Assuming no hematuria = no stone.** 10-15% of proven urolithiasis cases have no hematuria on UA. Complete ureteral obstruction can eliminate hematuria. CT is required if clinical suspicion is present regardless of UA result.

3. **Discharging an infected obstructing stone.** Fever or pyuria with an obstructing stone is a urologic emergency requiring emergent decompression (nephrostomy or stent). Antibiotics alone are insufficient — the infected urine above the obstruction cannot drain.

4. **Forcing IV fluids to "flush" the stone.** Aggressive IV hydration does not accelerate stone passage and worsens pain by increasing hydrostatic pressure above the obstruction.

5. **Prescribing tamsulosin for stones < 5 mm without shared decision-making.** Stones ≤ 5 mm have high spontaneous passage rates (>80%). MET benefit is most established for stones 5-10 mm. For smaller stones, the NNT is less favorable.

6. **Missing bilateral obstruction in a patient with rising creatinine and no urine output.** Bilateral obstructing stones cause post-renal AKI. This diagnosis requires imaging and emergent bilateral decompression.

7. **Not obtaining a pregnancy test before CT in reproductive-age women.** CT delivers ionizing radiation. POCUS is first-line in pregnancy. A positive beta-hCG changes the imaging algorithm entirely.

8. **Anchoring on known stone history and missing alternative diagnoses.** Patients with recurrent stones can also have appendicitis, AAA, ectopic pregnancy, or mesenteric ischemia. The CT obtained for "stone protocol" must be reviewed for alternate findings.

9. **Using meperidine (Demerol) for renal colic.** Meperidine has a neurotoxic metabolite (normeperidine), is no more effective than other opioids, and is not recommended. Use morphine, hydromorphone, or fentanyl if opioids are needed.
