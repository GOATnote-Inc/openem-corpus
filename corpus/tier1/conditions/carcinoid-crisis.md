# Carcinoid Crisis

## Recognition

**Definition:**
- Life-threatening exacerbation of carcinoid syndrome caused by massive release of bioactive amines (serotonin, histamine, kallikrein, prostaglandins) from neuroendocrine tumor
- Characterized by hemodynamic instability (severe hypotension or hypertension), bronchospasm, and flushing

**Classic presentation:**
- Profound hypotension (most common and dangerous feature) — may be refractory to standard vasopressors
- Severe flushing (diffuse, deep red to purple)
- Bronchospasm/wheezing
- Tachycardia (or occasionally bradycardia)
- Diarrhea (profuse, watery)
- Altered mental status (from hypoperfusion)
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Hypertensive episodes (less common; catecholamine co-secretion)

**Common triggers:**
- Surgical manipulation of tumor (intraoperative crisis — most classic setting)
- Anesthesia induction
- Hepatic artery embolization/chemoembolization
- Biopsy of primary or metastatic tumor
- Catecholamines (exogenous epinephrine/norepinephrine — may worsen crisis)
- Chemotherapy
- Emotional stress, alcohol

**Carcinoid syndrome (chronic, not crisis):**
- Flushing (90%), diarrhea (75%), wheezing (15%)
- Right-sided valvular heart disease (carcinoid heart disease)
- Usually requires hepatic metastases to bypass first-pass metabolism

## Critical Actions

1. **Octreotide 500 mcg IV bolus** — first-line treatment; may repeat q5-10 min up to 3 doses
2. **Start octreotide infusion 50-200 mcg/hr IV** after bolus; titrate to hemodynamic stability
3. **Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation** — NS 1-2 L bolus for hypotension; crystalloid-responsive before vasopressors
4. **Vasopressors for refractory hypotension:** vasopressin 0.04 units/min IV (preferred) — AVOID catecholamines initially (epinephrine, norepinephrine may worsen crisis by stimulating hormone release)
5. **Bronchospasm:** ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized (preferred); albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized; avoid epinephrine if possible
6. **If intraoperative:** communicate with surgical team to stop tumor manipulation; anesthesia to deepen sedation

## Differential Diagnosis

- Anaphylaxis (urticaria, angioedema, allergen exposure; responds to epinephrine)
- Pheochromocytoma crisis (paroxysmal hypertension, elevated catecholamines)
- Serotonin syndrome (medication history, clonus, agitation, hyperthermia)
- Mastocytosis / systemic mast cell activation (urticaria pigmentosa; elevated tryptase)
- Thyroid storm (fever, tachycardia, tremor; elevated T3/T4)
- Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIPoma) — profuse watery diarrhea, hypokalemia
- Septic shock (fever, infection source, positive cultures)
- Drug reaction/hypersensitivity

## Workup

- **Serum serotonin** — elevated (may not be available emergently)
- **24-hour urine 5-HIAA** (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) — gold standard for carcinoid syndrome (not useful in acute crisis; delayed result)
- **Chromogranin A** — elevated in neuroendocrine tumors; nonspecific
- **BMP:** electrolytes (diarrhea-induced hypokalemia, dehydration)
- **CBC** — baseline
- **Lactate** — assess tissue perfusion
- **ECG** — arrhythmia screen; right heart strain
- **Troponin** — demand ischemia from hemodynamic instability
- **Echocardiogram** — assess for carcinoid heart disease (thickened, retracted tricuspid and pulmonic valves)
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast** — identify primary tumor, hepatic metastases (if not already known)
- **Tryptase** — to distinguish from anaphylaxis/mastocytosis

## Treatment

### Octreotide (First-Line)
- **Octreotide 500 mcg IV bolus** — repeat q5-10 min as needed (total up to 2000 mcg in acute crisis)
- **Octreotide infusion 50-200 mcg/hr IV** — continue until stable; may need > 200 mcg/hr in severe cases
- Taper slowly (25-50% q6-12h) once stable for 24 hours
- Mechanism: somatostatin analog that inhibits release of serotonin and other bioactive peptides

### Hemodynamic Support
- **IV crystalloid** (NS or LR) 1-2 L bolus — intravascular depletion from vasodilation and third-spacing
- **Vasopressin** 0.04 units/min IV — preferred first-line vasopressor (does not stimulate hormone release)
- **Phenylephrine** 100-200 mcg IV bolus, then 0.5-2 mcg/kg/min — pure alpha-agonist; reasonable alternative
- **Norepinephrine** 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min — if vasopressin/phenylephrine insufficient; use with caution (beta-adrenergic stimulation may trigger more hormone release)
- **AVOID epinephrine** if possible — may paradoxically worsen crisis

### Bronchospasm
- **Ipratropium** 0.5 mg nebulized q20min — anticholinergic; no beta-adrenergic concerns
- **Albuterol** 2.5 mg nebulized — acceptable if needed
- Avoid theophylline (may trigger hormone release)
- Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV — adjunctive for severe bronchospasm

### Perioperative Prophylaxis
- **Octreotide** 250-500 mcg IV prior to induction
- Continue octreotide infusion 50-100 mcg/hr intraoperatively
- Have additional octreotide and vasopressin immediately available
- Avoid morphine, succinylcholine, histamine-releasing agents

### Carcinoid Heart Disease
- Echocardiographic assessment of tricuspid/pulmonic valves
- Diuretics for right heart failure (furosemide 20-40 mg IV)
- Valve replacement for severe valvular dysfunction (cardiothoracic surgery referral)

## Disposition

- **All carcinoid crisis:** ICU admission with invasive hemodynamic monitoring
- **Stable carcinoid syndrome exacerbation (flushing, diarrhea without hemodynamic instability):** oncology consult, may manage on monitored floor
- **Known carcinoid patient pre-procedure:** ensure octreotide prophylaxis protocol in place; ICU bed reserved post-procedure
- **New diagnosis:** oncology consultation, staging workup

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating carcinoid crisis like anaphylaxis with epinephrine.** Epinephrine can worsen carcinoid crisis by stimulating further hormone release from the tumor. Octreotide is the specific first-line treatment, not epinephrine.

2. **Using catecholamine vasopressors as first-line.** Norepinephrine and epinephrine may exacerbate hormone secretion. Use vasopressin or phenylephrine first for refractory hypotension.

3. **Not having octreotide available during procedures on known carcinoid patients.** Tumor manipulation predictably causes mediator release. Perioperative octreotide prophylaxis is standard of care.

4. **Missing carcinoid crisis as the diagnosis.** Intraoperative or peri-procedural refractory hypotension with flushing in a patient with a known neuroendocrine tumor (or hepatic metastases) is carcinoid crisis until proven otherwise.

5. **Inadequate octreotide dosing.** Standard carcinoid syndrome doses (150 mcg SQ TID) are insufficient for crisis. Bolus doses of 500 mcg IV with continuous infusion at 50-200 mcg/hr (or higher) are required.

6. **Not assessing for carcinoid heart disease.** Up to 60% of patients with carcinoid syndrome develop right-sided valvular disease. An echocardiogram is essential for management planning, especially before surgery.
