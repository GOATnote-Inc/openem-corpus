# Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)

## Recognition

**Definition:** Large- and medium-vessel granulomatous vasculitis affecting the aorta and its extracranial branches, especially the temporal, ophthalmic, posterior ciliary, and vertebral arteries. Exclusively occurs in patients >50 years. The ophthalmologic emergency: untreated GCA causes irreversible vision loss.

**Epidemiology:**
- Age >50 (virtually never younger; mean age at diagnosis 72 years)
- Female:male ratio 2-3:1
- Northern European descent: highest incidence (15-25 per 100,000 >50 years)
- 40-60% of GCA patients have concurrent polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)

**Presentation:**
- **New-onset headache:** temporal location, unilateral or bilateral, throbbing or constant. Present in 65-75% of patients. New headache quality or location in an elderly patient.
- **Jaw claudication:** pain in masseter muscles with chewing that resolves with rest. Most specific symptom (LR+ 4.2). Present in 30-50%.
- **Scalp tenderness:** pain with hair brushing, wearing hat, or resting head on pillow. Present in 30-50%.
- **Visual symptoms (the emergency):**
  - Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular vision loss): precedes permanent loss in 30-50%. THIS IS THE WARNING — treat immediately.
  - Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION): sudden, painless, monocular vision loss. The most common mechanism of permanent visual loss in GCA.
  - Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO): 10-15% of GCA-related vision loss.
  - Diplopia (from cranial nerve ischemia or extraocular muscle ischemia): 5-10%.
  - Contralateral eye involvement: occurs within days to 2 weeks in untreated patients.
- **Constitutional symptoms:** fever (up to 39°C, often low-grade; GCA is a cause of FUO in elderly), weight loss, malaise, anorexia.
- **Polymyalgia rheumatica symptoms:** bilateral shoulder and hip girdle pain/stiffness, morning stiffness >45 minutes, difficulty raising arms above head.

**Exam Findings:**
- Temporal artery: tender, thickened, nodular, decreased or absent pulse
- Reduced visual acuity (if AION or CRAO has occurred)
- Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) if optic neuropathy is unilateral
- Fundoscopy: pale, swollen optic disc (AION); cherry-red spot (CRAO); may be normal in amaurosis fugax
- Diminished pulses in upper extremities (large-vessel GCA with subclavian/axillary involvement)

**ACR 1990 Classification Criteria (≥3 of 5):**
1. Age ≥50 at disease onset
2. New headache
3. Temporal artery tenderness or decreased pulse
4. ESR ≥50 mm/hr
5. Positive temporal artery biopsy (granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells)

## Critical Actions

1. **Treat empirically based on clinical suspicion — do NOT wait for biopsy results.** If GCA is suspected clinically (age >50, new headache, jaw claudication, visual symptoms, elevated ESR/CRP), start high-dose corticosteroids immediately. Temporal artery biopsy pathology remains interpretable for 2-6 weeks after steroid initiation.
2. **Acute vision loss or amaurosis fugax: methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 consecutive days.** Then transition to prednisone 1 mg/kg/day PO (max 80 mg). IV pulse dosing is for any visual symptom — including transient episodes.
3. **No visual symptoms: prednisone 1 mg/kg/day PO (max 80 mg).** Start immediately. Do not wait for ESR results.
4. **Arrange temporal artery biopsy within 2 weeks.** Unilateral biopsy with ≥2 cm specimen. Sensitivity is 85-90% (skip lesions cause false negatives). If unilateral biopsy is negative and clinical suspicion remains high, biopsy the contralateral side.
5. **Urgent ophthalmology consultation** — same day. Formal visual field testing, fundoscopy, fluorescein angiography can confirm ischemic optic neuropathy or CRAO.
6. **Rheumatology consultation** for long-term management (steroid taper, steroid-sparing agents, tocilizumab).
7. **Protect the contralateral eye.** In unilateral vision loss from GCA, the contralateral eye can be lost within days without treatment. This is the primary treatment goal.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Tension-type headache | Bilateral, band-like, no systemic symptoms, no elevated inflammatory markers. Chronic pattern unlike the new-onset headache of GCA. |
| Migraine | Episodic, often with aura, photophobia/phonophobia, nausea. Younger age. Normal ESR/CRP. |
| Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) | Sudden monocular vision loss with disc edema, but: younger age range (50-70), associated with small "disc at risk" (small cup-to-disc ratio), nocturnal hypotension, no jaw claudication, normal ESR/CRP. |
| Trigeminal neuralgia | Lancinating, electric-shock-like facial pain in V2/V3 distribution. Triggered by touch, chewing, talking. No systemic inflammation. |
| TMJ dysfunction | Jaw pain with chewing, but pain is at the TMJ joint, not masseter muscles. No systemic symptoms, normal ESR. |
| Takayasu arteritis | Large-vessel vasculitis, but age <40 years. Pulseless upper extremities, aortic regurgitation. |
| Primary CNS vasculitis | Headache, cognitive changes, focal neuro deficits. Angiography shows beading of intracranial vessels. Normal ESR. |
| Malignancy (lymphoma, myeloma) | Elevated ESR, constitutional symptoms. No jaw claudication, no temporal artery abnormalities. Peripheral smear, SPEP/UPEP, imaging distinguish. |

## Workup

**Emergent (in ED):**
- ESR (Westergren method): elevated >50 mm/hr in 85% of GCA. Sensitivity 85%, specificity ~70%. ESR >100 mm/hr is highly suggestive but not diagnostic.
- CRP: elevated in >95% of GCA. More sensitive than ESR. Normal CRP has high negative predictive value.
- CBC: thrombocytosis (platelet count >400,000) is common and supports the diagnosis. Normochromic normocytic anemia in 30%.
- CMP: baseline hepatic and renal function before starting high-dose steroids.
- Visual acuity (each eye separately).
- Pupil exam (RAPD).
- Fundoscopy (disc edema, pallor, CRAO findings).
- Point-of-care glucose (hyperglycemia monitoring with high-dose steroids).

**Important Nuance:** A NORMAL ESR does not exclude GCA. Up to 15% of biopsy-proven GCA has ESR <50 mm/hr. If clinical suspicion is high, treat regardless of ESR.

**Diagnostic Confirmation:**
- Temporal artery biopsy: gold standard. Obtain within 2 weeks of starting steroids. Minimum 2 cm specimen (skip lesions). Pathology: transmural inflammation with mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells (in 50%), intimal hyperplasia, fragmentation of internal elastic lamina.
- Temporal artery ultrasound: halo sign (hypoechoic wall thickening) has 77% sensitivity, 96% specificity in experienced hands. Can be used to guide biopsy or as alternative in some centers.
- CTA/MRA of temporal arteries: wall thickening and enhancement. Increasingly used but not yet standard of care in ED.
- PET-CT: for large-vessel GCA (aortitis). Not an ED test.

## Treatment

**Acute Vision Loss (AION, CRAO, diplopia, or amaurosis fugax):**
- Methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 consecutive days
- Then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day PO (max 80 mg/day)
- Aspirin 81-100 mg PO daily (reduces risk of ischemic events including vision loss and stroke — start in ED)
- PPI for GI prophylaxis: omeprazole 20 mg PO daily (high-dose steroid + aspirin)

**No Vision Loss (systemic GCA, suspected on clinical/lab grounds):**
- Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day PO (max 80 mg/day)
- Aspirin 81-100 mg PO daily
- PPI: omeprazole 20 mg PO daily

**Adjunctive ED Measures:**
- Calcium 1,200 mg + vitamin D 800 IU daily (osteoporosis prevention with chronic steroids)
- Blood glucose monitoring (steroid-induced hyperglycemia, especially in diabetics)
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis already addressed by PPI

**Long-term (rheumatology-directed, document in ED notes):**
- Steroid taper: slow, over 12-24 months total. Guided by symptoms and ESR/CRP.
- Tocilizumab 162 mg SC weekly: FDA-approved steroid-sparing agent for GCA. Reduces relapse and cumulative steroid exposure. Initiated by rheumatology.
- Methotrexate: modest steroid-sparing effect, used in some patients.
- Bone density monitoring, diabetes screening, PCP prophylaxis if prolonged high-dose steroids.

## Disposition

**Admission:**
- Acute vision loss (AION, CRAO, amaurosis fugax): admit for IV methylprednisolone pulse therapy, serial visual acuity checks, ophthalmology monitoring, and biopsy scheduling
- New diplopia concerning for GCA: admit for IV steroids and evaluation
- Significant comorbidities complicating high-dose steroid initiation (uncontrolled diabetes, active GI bleeding)

**Discharge with Urgent Follow-up (if NO visual symptoms):**
- Start prednisone 1 mg/kg/day PO and aspirin 81 mg PO daily in ED
- Temporal artery biopsy within 1-2 weeks (arrange before discharge: vascular surgery or interventional radiology)
- Ophthalmology appointment within 1-3 days (visual screening even if asymptomatic)
- Rheumatology appointment within 1-2 weeks
- Return precautions: any visual change (blurriness, transient vision loss, double vision), severe headache escalation
- Glucose monitoring instructions (especially if diabetic)

**Transfer:**
- If facility lacks ophthalmology and patient has visual symptoms: emergent transfer to tertiary center
- Start IV methylprednisolone before transfer — do not delay treatment

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for ESR results to start treatment.** GCA with visual symptoms is a medical emergency measured in hours. Methylprednisolone 1 g IV should be started on clinical suspicion alone. ESR is normal in up to 15% of biopsy-proven GCA. Waiting for lab confirmation while the contralateral eye loses perfusion is the cardinal error.

2. **Treating amaurosis fugax as benign.** Transient monocular vision loss in a patient >50 with elevated inflammatory markers is GCA until proven otherwise. Amaurosis fugax precedes permanent vision loss in 30-50% of GCA patients. These patients need IV methylprednisolone immediately, not outpatient follow-up.

3. **Using oral steroids instead of IV pulse for acute vision loss.** Oral prednisone is insufficient for acute arteritic vision loss. Methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily for 3 days is the standard. The goal is to prevent contralateral eye involvement and salvage any remaining perfusion.

4. **Relying on a normal temporal artery exam to exclude GCA.** The temporal artery is clinically normal (nontender, pulsatile) in 30-40% of biopsy-proven GCA. Many patients have occult large-vessel GCA affecting the aorta and its branches without superficial temporal involvement.

5. **Dismissing jaw claudication as TMJ.** Jaw claudication (masseter pain with chewing that resolves with rest) is the most specific symptom for GCA (LR+ 4.2). TMJ pain localizes to the joint, not the muscles. Jaw claudication in a patient >50 with headache and elevated ESR demands empiric treatment.

6. **Not ordering CRP alongside ESR.** CRP is more sensitive than ESR for GCA (>95% sensitivity vs. 85%). A normal ESR with elevated CRP still warrants treatment. Ordering both together provides the highest diagnostic sensitivity.

7. **Assuming biopsy will be ruined by starting steroids.** Temporal artery biopsy remains pathologically interpretable for 2-6 weeks after starting corticosteroids. Starting treatment should NEVER be delayed to preserve biopsy yield. Arrange biopsy within 2 weeks.

8. **Forgetting aspirin.** Low-dose aspirin (81-100 mg daily) reduces ischemic events (vision loss, stroke, TIA) in GCA patients on corticosteroids. It should be started in the ED alongside steroids.

9. **Missing large-vessel GCA.** GCA is not limited to the temporal arteries. Large-vessel GCA affects the aorta and great vessels, causing limb claudication, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, and stroke. Upper extremity blood pressure discrepancy (>15 mmHg) or diminished pulses should raise suspicion.
