# Threatened Abortion / Miscarriage

## Recognition

**Definitions and Classification:**
Early pregnancy loss (miscarriage) refers to nonviable intrauterine pregnancy up to 13 weeks 0 days gestational age. Classification by clinical presentation:

- **Threatened abortion (O20.0):** Vaginal bleeding with closed cervical os and viable intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) on ultrasound. Fetal cardiac activity present. Occurs in 20-25% of all pregnancies; approximately 50% will progress to pregnancy loss.
- **Inevitable abortion:** Vaginal bleeding with open (dilated) cervical os. Membranes may be intact. Pregnancy loss is imminent or unavoidable.
- **Incomplete abortion:** Partial expulsion of products of conception (POC). Open os, ongoing bleeding, retained tissue on ultrasound.
- **Complete abortion:** Complete expulsion of all POC. Bleeding diminishing. Os closing or closed. Empty uterus on ultrasound with prior confirmed IUP.
- **Missed abortion / embryonic demise (O02.1):** Nonviable pregnancy retained in utero. Closed os, minimal or no bleeding. Diagnosed on ultrasound (absent fetal cardiac activity or anembryonic gestation).
- **Spontaneous abortion, unspecified (O03.9):** Completed pregnancy loss without further specification.

**Incidence:** 15-20% of clinically recognized pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion. The true rate including preclinical losses is 30-50%. Most occur in the first trimester (< 13 weeks).

**Risk Factors:**
- Advanced maternal age (risk doubles from age 20 to age 35; exceeds 50% after age 45)
- Prior miscarriage (recurrent loss defined as 3 or more consecutive losses)
- Chromosomal abnormalities (cause 50-60% of first trimester losses; most common: trisomies, monosomy X, triploidy)
- Uterine anomalies (septate uterus, fibroids, Asherman syndrome)
- Uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease
- Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Tobacco, alcohol, cocaine use
- Infections (Listeria, Toxoplasma, CMV, syphilis)
- Trauma

**Presentation:**
- Vaginal bleeding (ranges from spotting to hemorrhage)
- Lower abdominal or pelvic cramping
- Passage of tissue or clots
- Back pain
- Symptoms may be absent in missed abortion (diagnosed incidentally on ultrasound)

**Exam Findings:**
- Speculum exam: source of bleeding (cervical os vs. other), os open or closed, tissue at or protruding from os, amount of active bleeding
- Bimanual exam: uterine size (appropriate for dates vs. small-for-dates), tenderness, cervical motion tenderness (raises concern for ectopic), adnexal mass or tenderness

**The Central Clinical Question:** In every patient presenting with first trimester vaginal bleeding, the emergency physician must determine: (1) is the pregnancy intrauterine, (2) is it viable, and (3) is the patient hemodynamically stable. Failure to exclude ectopic pregnancy is the most dangerous pitfall.

## Critical Actions

1. **Quantitative beta-hCG** on every reproductive-age patient with vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or syncope. Regardless of stated sexual history, contraceptive use, or prior tubal ligation.
2. **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)** to confirm intrauterine pregnancy, assess viability, and exclude ectopic pregnancy. This is the single most important diagnostic step.
3. **Type and Rh status** on all patients with first trimester bleeding. Administer Rh(D) immune globulin to Rh-negative patients: 50 mcg MICRhoGAM IM if < 12 weeks gestation, 300 mcg RhoGAM IM if >= 12 weeks. **Note:** ACOG 2024 Clinical Practice Update states that Rh testing and RhIg administration may be foregone for pregnancy loss at < 12 weeks based on newer evidence of low sensitization risk; however, many EDs still administer per ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 181 (2017) until institutional protocols update. When in doubt, administer.
4. **Exclude ectopic pregnancy** in every patient. An IUP on TVUS effectively excludes ectopic in natural conception (heterotopic risk 1:30,000). In IVF patients, heterotopic risk is up to 1:100 -- IUP does NOT exclude concurrent ectopic.
5. **Hemodynamic assessment.** Two large-bore IVs and crystalloid resuscitation if significant hemorrhage. Type and crossmatch if hemodynamically unstable.
6. **Cervical exam** to classify threatened vs. inevitable vs. incomplete. Check for tissue at the os (remove with ring forceps if causing cervical shock -- vasovagal bradycardia and hypotension from cervical distention).

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Ectopic pregnancy | No IUP on TVUS; adnexal mass or free fluid; hCG above discriminatory zone with empty uterus. Must be excluded in every patient with first trimester bleeding. |
| Cervical or vaginal pathology | Trauma, cervicitis, cervical polyp, cervical cancer. Bleeding from a non-uterine source on speculum exam. Pregnancy test may be positive or negative (independent finding). |
| Subchorionic hemorrhage | IUP present with crescent-shaped hypoechoic collection between gestational sac and uterine wall. Most resolve spontaneously. Large hematomas (> 50% of sac) associated with higher loss rates. |
| Gestational trophoblastic disease (molar pregnancy) | Markedly elevated hCG (often > 100,000 mIU/mL). "Snowstorm" or "cluster of grapes" appearance on ultrasound. Uterus large for dates. Theca lutein cysts. |
| Implantation bleeding | Light spotting around time of expected menses (4-6 weeks gestation). Brief, self-limited, painless. Normal hCG trend and ultrasound. |
| Cervical ectopic pregnancy | Rare. Bleeding with gestational sac within the cervix on TVUS. High hemorrhage risk. OB/GYN consultation for management. |
| Corpus luteum cyst rupture | Unilateral adnexal pain with free pelvic fluid. IUP present. Self-limited hemoperitoneum in most cases. |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- **Quantitative beta-hCG (serum):**
  - Discriminatory zone: 1,500-3,000 mIU/mL for TVUS (an IUP should be visible above this level). Transabdominal US discriminatory zone is approximately 6,500 mIU/mL.
  - If hCG above the discriminatory zone and no IUP on TVUS: ectopic pregnancy until proven otherwise.
  - If hCG below the discriminatory zone: pregnancy of unknown location (PUL). Obtain serial hCG in 48 hours. In a normal viable IUP, hCG rises > 53% in 48 hours (Barnhart 2004). A rise < 53%, plateau, or decline suggests ectopic or nonviable IUP but does not differentiate between them.
  - Falling hCG does not exclude ectopic pregnancy (ruptured ectopics can have falling hCG).
- **CBC** -- hemoglobin baseline; serial if ongoing bleeding.
- **Type and screen / Rh type** -- mandatory. Crossmatch if hemodynamically unstable.
- **BMP** -- if significant hemorrhage or hemodynamic instability.
- **Coagulation studies (PT/INR, fibrinogen)** -- if heavy hemorrhage or suspected DIC (rare; seen with retained products and septic abortion).

**Imaging:**
- **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS):** First-line imaging for all first trimester bleeding.
  - **Viable IUP:** Gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole, fetal cardiac activity present.
  - **Definitive criteria for nonviability (SRU/ACOG 2013):**
    - CRL >= 7 mm with no cardiac activity (definitive pregnancy failure)
    - Mean sac diameter (MSD) >= 25 mm with no embryo (definitive anembryonic pregnancy)
  - **Findings suspicious but not definitive for nonviability (require follow-up US in 7-14 days):**
    - CRL < 7 mm with no cardiac activity
    - MSD 16-24 mm with no embryo
    - Absence of embryo with heartbeat >= 14 days after a sac without yolk sac was seen
    - Absence of embryo with heartbeat >= 11 days after a sac with yolk sac was seen
  - **Subchorionic hematoma:** Crescent-shaped hypoechoic collection. Quantify size relative to gestational sac.
  - **Empty uterus with positive hCG:** Very early IUP (hCG below discriminatory zone), completed miscarriage, or ectopic pregnancy. Correlate with hCG level and clinical context.

- **POCUS (emergency physician bedside):** Goal is to identify IUP (gestational sac with yolk sac or fetal pole). An IUP on bedside US effectively excludes ectopic in natural conception. Free fluid in Morison's pouch or pelvis with no IUP and positive pregnancy test is ruptured ectopic until proven otherwise.

**Do NOT order:**
- Progesterone levels are not recommended in the ED for predicting viability (poor sensitivity and specificity at the individual patient level).
- Transvaginal ultrasound should not be delayed in favor of transabdominal approach; TVUS is superior for early pregnancy evaluation.

## Treatment

**Threatened Abortion (Viable IUP, Closed Os):**
- **Expectant management** is standard. No intervention has been proven to prevent progression to miscarriage.
- **Progesterone:** The PRISM trial (Coomarasamy 2019, NEJM) showed no significant benefit of vaginal progesterone for threatened miscarriage overall (75% vs 72% live birth rate, p=0.08). A subgroup with history of >= 3 prior miscarriages showed benefit (72% vs 57%). Routine progesterone is NOT standard ED practice; defer to OB/GYN for outpatient consideration in recurrent loss.
- **Bed rest is NOT recommended** (ACOG 2018). No evidence of benefit and may cause harm (VTE risk, psychological distress, lost productivity).
- **Pelvic rest:** Avoid intercourse, douching, and tampon use until bleeding resolves (expert consensus; limited evidence).
- **Rh(D) immune globulin:** 50 mcg MICRhoGAM IM for Rh-negative patients at < 12 weeks; 300 mcg RhoGAM IM at >= 12 weeks. See Critical Actions note regarding 2024 ACOG update on < 12-week administration.

**Inevitable or Incomplete Abortion (Open Os, Active Bleeding):**

Hemodynamically stable -- three management options (shared decision-making with patient):

1. **Expectant management:** Appropriate for incomplete abortion with minimal retained tissue and light bleeding. Complete expulsion occurs in 80% within 2 weeks. Requires reliable follow-up and patient understanding of warning signs.

2. **Medical management (misoprostol):**
   - Misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally (preferred route for efficacy). May repeat dose in 24-48 hours if incomplete expulsion.
   - Mifepristone 200 mg PO followed by misoprostol 800 mcg vaginally 24-48 hours later is more effective than misoprostol alone (88% vs 71% complete expulsion by day 8; Schreiber 2018, NEJM). Combination regimen is recommended by ACOG when mifepristone is available.
   - Prescribe analgesics: ibuprofen 600-800 mg PO q6h (first-line), acetaminophen-oxycodone for breakthrough pain.
   - Antiemetic: ondansetron 4 mg ODT PRN for nausea associated with misoprostol.

3. **Surgical management (uterine aspiration):**
   - Manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) or suction dilation and curettage (D&C).
   - Indications: patient preference, heavy hemorrhage, hemodynamic instability, failed medical management, suspected infected retained products, contraindication to medical management.
   - MVA can be performed in the ED or clinic for gestations < 12 weeks.
   - Procedural sedation or paracervical block for pain management.

**Missed Abortion (Embryonic Demise, Closed Os):**
- Same three options as incomplete abortion (expectant, medical, surgical). Success rate of expectant management is lower for missed abortion than incomplete (approximately 50-65% at 4 weeks).
- Medical management with mifepristone + misoprostol is preferred over misoprostol alone (ACOG 2018).
- Surgical management provides definitive treatment with fastest resolution.

**Hemorrhagic Miscarriage (Hemodynamically Unstable):**
- ABCs, two large-bore IVs, crystalloid resuscitation with isotonic fluids.
- Type and crossmatch, transfuse pRBCs for hemorrhagic shock (do not wait for type-specific blood -- use O-negative if critical).
- **Uterotonic agents** for hemorrhage from incomplete abortion:
  - Methylergonovine (Methergine) 0.2 mg IM (contraindicated in hypertension)
  - Misoprostol 800-1000 mcg rectally
  - Oxytocin 20-40 units in 1L NS IV infusion
- Emergent OB/GYN consultation for surgical evacuation (D&C or MVA).
- **Cervical shock:** Tissue impacted in the cervical os causes vasovagal response (bradycardia, hypotension). Remove tissue with ring forceps or sponge forceps -- hemodynamics often improve immediately. Atropine 0.5 mg IV if persistent bradycardia.
- Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 min (extrapolated from postpartum hemorrhage data; reasonable adjunct in significant hemorrhage).

**Rh(D) Immune Globulin -- All Scenarios:**
- Administer to ALL Rh-negative patients with first trimester bleeding regardless of diagnosis or management path.
- < 12 weeks: 50 mcg MICRhoGAM IM (mini-dose sufficient for fetomaternal hemorrhage up to 2.5 mL of fetal RBCs).
- >= 12 weeks: 300 mcg RhoGAM IM (standard dose covers up to 30 mL fetal whole blood).
- **2024 ACOG update:** For pregnancy loss at < 12 0/7 weeks, ACOG states that Rh testing and RhIg may be forgone based on evidence that fetal RBC volume at this gestational age is below the sensitization threshold. Institutional protocols vary; err on the side of administration until local guidance updates. For threatened abortion with ongoing viable pregnancy, standard RhIg administration remains appropriate.

**Emotional Support:**
- Acknowledge the loss. Miscarriage is common but the emotional impact is significant.
- Use patient-preferred language. Many patients prefer "miscarriage" over "abortion" (medical terminology may be misunderstood).
- Offer social work consultation, grief counseling resources, and support group information.
- Address guilt: reassure that miscarriage is almost never caused by anything the patient did or failed to do.

## Disposition

**Emergent Surgical Intervention:**
- Hemorrhagic shock from incomplete abortion unresponsive to uterotonics
- Suspected septic abortion (fever, uterine tenderness, foul discharge, retained products)

**Admission:**
- Hemodynamically unstable but stabilized (observation for recurrent hemorrhage)
- Ongoing hemorrhage requiring transfusion
- Suspected septic abortion (IV antibiotics + surgical evacuation)

**Discharge with OB/GYN Follow-Up (48-72 hours):**
- **Threatened abortion (viable IUP):** Pelvic rest. Repeat ultrasound in 1-2 weeks for viability. Return for heavy bleeding (soaking > 1 pad/hour), severe pain, fever, dizziness/syncope.
- **Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL):** hCG below discriminatory zone with no IUP on TVUS. Serial hCG in 48 hours is mandatory. Patient must understand ectopic precautions.
- **Confirmed pregnancy loss (expectant or medical management):** Misoprostol instructions, analgesic prescription, expected course (bleeding and cramping for 1-2 weeks), warning signs for return (heavy bleeding, fever, foul-smelling discharge).
- **Post-procedural (MVA/D&C):** If stable, minimal bleeding, no complications. Follow-up in 1-2 weeks.

**Discharge Instructions Must Include:**
- Return immediately for: heavy bleeding (soaking > 1 pad/hour for > 2 hours), dizziness or fainting, fever > 38.0C (100.4F), severe abdominal pain unresponsive to prescribed analgesics, foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
- No intercourse, tampons, or douching until bleeding stops and follow-up completed.
- hCG follow-up schedule if PUL or serial monitoring planned.
- Contraception counseling: ovulation may resume within 2-4 weeks after pregnancy loss. If pregnancy spacing desired, contraception can be initiated immediately (including IUD placement at time of surgical management).
- Future pregnancy counseling: one prior miscarriage does not significantly increase risk for future pregnancies. Evaluation for recurrent pregnancy loss is indicated after 3 or more consecutive losses.

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to exclude ectopic pregnancy.** This is the life-threatening miss. Every patient with first trimester bleeding must have ectopic ruled out with TVUS and hCG correlation. An empty uterus with hCG above the discriminatory zone (1,500-3,000 mIU/mL for TVUS) is ectopic until proven otherwise. Anchoring on "miscarriage" without imaging kills patients.

2. **Diagnosing nonviable pregnancy too early.** Applying outdated or less stringent ultrasound criteria for pregnancy failure can lead to intervention on a viable pregnancy. Use the SRU/ACOG 2013 criteria: CRL >= 7 mm with no cardiac activity, or MSD >= 25 mm with no embryo. If findings are indeterminate, repeat ultrasound in 7-14 days. Never diagnose nonviability on a single borderline scan.

3. **Forgetting Rh(D) immune globulin in Rh-negative patients.** Fetomaternal hemorrhage occurs even in early pregnancy. Failure to administer RhIg jeopardizes all future pregnancies through Rh alloimmunization. Administer to every Rh-negative patient with first trimester bleeding regardless of gestational age or management path. This applies to threatened abortion, miscarriage, AND ectopic pregnancy.

4. **Confusing a pseudosac with an IUP.** A pseudosac (decidual reaction to ectopic pregnancy) appears as a small intrauterine fluid collection without a yolk sac, fetal pole, or double decidual sign. Misidentifying this as an IUP causes false reassurance and delays ectopic diagnosis. A true IUP must show a yolk sac or embryo within the gestational sac.

5. **Discharging a PUL without ectopic precautions.** A patient with hCG below the discriminatory zone and no IUP on TVUS has a pregnancy of unknown location. This may be a very early IUP, a completed miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. The patient must understand she has a pregnancy whose location is not yet confirmed, must return for serial hCG in 48 hours, and must return immediately for severe pain, syncope, or heavy bleeding.

6. **Not performing a speculum exam.** Failure to examine the cervix misses tissue at the os (which causes cervical shock -- bradycardia and hypotension reversible by removing the tissue) and misses alternative bleeding sources (cervicitis, polyp, laceration, cervical cancer).

7. **Recommending bed rest.** Bed rest does not prevent miscarriage (ACOG 2018) and may cause harm (VTE risk, psychological distress, lost wages). Providers who recommend bed rest propagate a myth that causes patients to blame themselves when miscarriage occurs despite compliance.

8. **Underestimating hemorrhage in incomplete abortion.** Patients with retained products and an open cervical os can hemorrhage rapidly. The uterus cannot contract and achieve hemostasis with retained tissue. Resuscitation, uterotonics, and emergent surgical evacuation may be needed. Do not discharge a patient with active heavy bleeding and incomplete abortion for "expectant management."

9. **Ignoring the emotional impact.** Early pregnancy loss is a grief event. Rushing through the clinical encounter without acknowledging the loss, using insensitive language ("at least it was early," "you can try again"), or discharging without support resources causes lasting harm to the patient-provider relationship and patient mental health. Provide empathetic communication and counseling resources.
