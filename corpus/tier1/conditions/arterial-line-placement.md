# Arterial Line Placement

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Continuous real-time blood pressure monitoring in hemodynamically unstable patients (shock, vasopressor use, post-cardiac arrest)
- Frequent arterial blood gas sampling (respiratory failure, DKA, severe metabolic derangement)
- Non-invasive BP cuff unreliable (severe obesity, arrhythmia with irregular pulse, burns)
- Titration of vasoactive medications requiring beat-to-beat pressure monitoring
- Cardiac output monitoring via pulse contour analysis (PiCCO, FloTrac)

**Site Selection:**

| Site | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Radial artery (first-line) | Superficial, collateral flow via ulnar artery, compressible, low complication rate | Smaller caliber, prone to vasospasm |
| Femoral artery | Large caliber, reliable in shock, closest to aortic pressure | Infection risk higher, limits patient mobility, difficult to compress |
| Dorsalis pedis | Alternative when radial unavailable | Distal site, pressure overestimation, smaller caliber |
| Brachial artery | Accessible, reasonable caliber | End-artery risk (no collateral), risk of median nerve injury |

**Contraindications:**
- Absent pulse at target site (relative — US can still identify vessel)
- Raynaud phenomenon or severe peripheral vascular disease at target site
- Local infection overlying insertion site
- AV fistula or graft in the ipsilateral extremity
- Abnormal Allen test (radial site) — controversial; many practitioners proceed regardless if US shows dual supply

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Ultrasound identification | Before needle insertion |
| First-pass cannulation | Goal > 70% with US guidance |
| Arterial waveform on monitor | Immediately post-connection |
| Zeroing and leveling transducer | At phlebostatic axis (4th ICS, mid-axillary line) |

1. **Ultrasound-guided technique** is recommended (first-pass success 75-96% vs 47-64% by palpation)
2. **Modified Allen test** (or US assessment of ulnar/radial dual supply) — if radial artery is target
3. **Sterile technique** — gloves, chlorhexidine prep, sterile drape
4. **Catheter-over-needle insertion** under US guidance → confirm arterial flash → advance catheter
5. **Connect to transducer system** → zero at phlebostatic axis → confirm arterial waveform
6. **Secure with suture or transparent dressing**

## Differential Diagnosis

**Alternative Hemodynamic Monitoring:**

| Alternative | When to Use |
|-------------|------------|
| Non-invasive BP cuff (oscillometric) | Stable patients; intermittent monitoring sufficient |
| Non-invasive continuous monitoring (ClearSight) | When arterial access not feasible; less accurate in shock |
| Central venous catheter (for CVP) | Volume status assessment; does not provide arterial pressure |
| Pulmonary artery catheter | Detailed hemodynamic profiling (cardiac output, wedge pressure) |
| Point-of-care ultrasound (cardiac) | Qualitative assessment of cardiac function; no continuous monitoring |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- Pulse palpation or US assessment at target site
- Modified Allen test (radial): compress both radial and ulnar arteries, release ulnar — hand should reperfuse within 5-7 seconds (positive Allen = adequate collateral flow)
- Coagulation status: arterial lines can be placed in coagulopathy (compressible site) but monitor for hematoma
- Assess for prior arterial punctures, grafts, or surgery at the site

**Equipment:**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Arterial catheter | 20g x 4.5 cm (radial, adults); 18g x 12 cm (femoral); Arrow or BD Insyte arterial |
| Guidewire | 0.021-inch (for Seldinger technique kits) |
| Ultrasound | Linear high-frequency probe (10-12 MHz) with sterile cover |
| Pressure transducer kit | With flush system (heparinized saline 1 unit/mL or plain saline at 3 mL/hr continuous flush) |
| Sterile supplies | Chlorhexidine, sterile gloves, drape |
| Lidocaine | 1% lidocaine 1-2 mL SC for local anesthesia (conscious patients) |
| Armboard | Wrist in 20-30 degrees dorsiflexion (radial); secured with tape |
| Transparent dressing | Tegaderm or equivalent |

## Treatment

### Radial Artery — Ultrasound-Guided (First-Line)

**Step 1: Position**
- Supine, arm on armboard with wrist in 20-30 degrees dorsiflexion (tape hand to board)
- Excessive dorsiflexion (> 45 degrees) compresses the artery against the radius

**Step 2: Ultrasound Identification**
- Linear probe in short-axis (transverse) over the radial artery at the wrist
- Radial artery: round, pulsatile, non-compressible; typically 2-3 mm diameter
- Identify relationship to flexor carpi radialis tendon (artery is lateral)

**Step 3: Prep and Anesthetize**
- Chlorhexidine skin prep
- Lidocaine 1% 0.5-1 mL SC (avoid deep injection that obscures artery)

**Step 4: Catheter-Over-Needle Technique (Short-Axis)**
- Hold 20g arterial catheter at 30-45 degree angle
- Insert under US guidance, tracking the needle tip in short-axis
- Arterial flash in catheter hub = needle tip in vessel lumen
- Drop angle to 10-15 degrees and advance catheter 1-2 mm further, then slide catheter off needle into artery
- If flash lost: transfixion technique — advance needle through posterior wall, remove needle, slowly withdraw catheter until blood returns, then advance

**Step 5: Alternative — Long-Axis (In-Plane)**
- Probe longitudinal over artery
- Visualize entire needle shaft entering the artery — superior needle tip visualization
- More technically demanding but lower posterior wall perforation rate

**Step 6: Alternative — Seldinger Technique**
- Arterial flash → pass 0.021-inch guidewire through needle → remove needle → advance catheter over wire
- Higher success rate in difficult cannulation (vasospasm, obesity, hypotension)

**Step 7: Connect and Confirm**
- Attach arterial extension tubing to pressure transducer
- Zero transducer at phlebostatic axis (4th ICS, mid-axillary line)
- Arterial waveform on monitor: dicrotic notch, systolic/diastolic/MAP displayed
- If dampened waveform: flush, reposition wrist, check for kinking

**Step 8: Secure**
- Suture or tape catheter to skin
- Transparent dressing over insertion site
- Label "ARTERIAL" prominently — prevent inadvertent medication injection

### Femoral Artery
- US-guided: linear probe in short axis over femoral artery at inguinal crease
- 18g catheter or Seldinger kit; insert at 45 degrees
- Advance until arterial flash; thread catheter or wire
- Confirm waveform, secure, label

### Post-Procedure
- Continuous waveform monitoring
- Assess distal perfusion (capillary refill, pulse oximetry on ipsilateral finger/toe) every 4 hours
- Flush system: continuous at 3 mL/hr (heparinized or plain saline)
- Rezero transducer with position changes
- Remove as soon as no longer clinically indicated — infection risk increases after 5-7 days

## Disposition

- **Successful placement:** ICU or monitored bed; continuous hemodynamic monitoring
- **Failed cannulation (> 3 attempts):** attempt alternate site; do not persist — vasospasm worsens with repeated attempts
- **Hematoma post-removal:** direct pressure x 10 minutes (radial), 15-20 minutes (femoral); assess for pseudoaneurysm with US if expanding
- **Ischemic complications (rare, < 1%):** remove catheter immediately; vascular surgery consultation if hand/foot ischemia persists after removal

## Pitfalls

1. **Not using ultrasound for radial artery cannulation.** Meta-analysis demonstrates US guidance increases first-pass success by 71% compared to palpation. In hypotensive patients, the radial pulse may be absent by palpation but easily visualized on US. US-guided technique is now standard of care.

2. **Excessive wrist dorsiflexion compressing the radial artery.** Dorsiflexion > 45 degrees stretches the radial artery over the radius, compressing its lumen and making cannulation more difficult. Optimal position is 20-30 degrees of dorsiflexion.

3. **Injecting medications through the arterial line.** Intra-arterial injection of vasopressors, sedatives, or other medications causes severe vasospasm, tissue necrosis, and potential limb loss. All arterial lines must be clearly labeled "ARTERIAL" with red tubing or marking. Use Luer-lock connections that differ from venous lines.

4. **Ignoring a dampened arterial waveform.** Damping indicates catheter kink, thrombus formation, air bubble in tubing, or catheter against the vessel wall. A dampened trace gives inaccurate pressure readings (underestimates systolic, overestimates diastolic). Troubleshoot systematically: flush, reposition, check tubing for air.

5. **Failing to zero the transducer at the correct level.** The phlebostatic axis (4th intercostal space, mid-axillary line) is the reference point. If the transducer is below this level, pressures read falsely high; if above, falsely low. Every 10 cm of height difference equals approximately 7.5 mmHg error.

6. **Leaving the arterial catheter in place beyond clinical need.** Radial artery thrombosis occurs in 5-25% of prolonged cannulations (usually asymptomatic due to ulnar collateral flow) but infection risk and thrombotic risk increase with duration. Remove when continuous monitoring and frequent ABGs are no longer needed.
