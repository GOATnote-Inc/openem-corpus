# Non-Accidental Trauma (Child Abuse)

## Recognition

**Definition:** Intentional physical injury inflicted on a child by a caregiver or other person. Encompasses direct trauma (hitting, shaking, burning, biting) and neglectful supervision patterns. A medical diagnosis and a legal mandate.

**Epidemiology:**
- ~700,000 confirmed cases of child maltreatment annually in the US; physical abuse accounts for ~18%
- Leading cause of traumatic death in infants < 1 year
- ~1,700 child abuse fatalities per year in the US
- Missed on initial ED presentation in approximately 30% of cases
- 25-50% of children returned to abusive environments after a missed diagnosis are re-injured; 5-10% die

**Risk Factors (child):**
- Age < 3 years (highest risk < 1 year)
- Prematurity and low birth weight
- Developmental delay, chronic illness, or disability
- Colic or excessive crying
- Unwanted pregnancy, twin gestation

**Risk Factors (caregiver/environment):**
- Young, single, or socially isolated parents
- Substance abuse, mental illness, domestic violence
- History of being abused themselves
- Financial stress, unstable housing
- Prior CPS involvement

**Red Flags for Inflicted Injury:**
- Injury inconsistent with stated mechanism or developmental stage (e.g., "rolled off the couch" with complex skull fracture)
- History that changes between caregivers or over time
- Delayed presentation (hours to days after injury)
- Multiple injuries in different stages of healing
- Injuries in non-ambulatory infants ("those who don't cruise rarely bruise")
- Bruising in unusual locations: torso, ears, neck, cheeks, buttocks, genitalia
- **TEN-4 Bruising Rule:** bruising to Torso, Ear, or Neck in a child < 4 years, OR any bruising in an infant < 4 months — sensitivity 97% for abuse
- Patterned injuries: loop marks (cords/belts), bite marks, cigarette burns (circular, uniform), immersion burns (stocking-glove distribution with sharp demarcation, sparing of flexion creases)

**Classic Fracture Patterns (high specificity for abuse):**
- Corner (bucket-handle) metaphyseal fractures — classic metaphyseal lesion (CML), nearly pathognomonic
- Posterior rib fractures (from anterior-posterior chest compression)
- Sternal fractures, scapular fractures, spinous process fractures
- Multiple fractures in different stages of healing
- Femur fractures in non-ambulatory children (< 1 year)
- Complex or bilateral skull fractures without adequate mechanism

**Abusive Head Trauma (formerly Shaken Baby Syndrome):**
- Triad: subdural hematoma (often interhemispheric) + retinal hemorrhages + encephalopathy
- Subdural hematoma without adequate mechanism in an infant
- Retinal hemorrhages (especially multilayered, extending to periphery) — highly specific for abusive head trauma
- Apnea, seizures, bulging fontanelle, altered consciousness, vomiting
- May present as apparent life-threatening event (ALTE/BRUE) or sudden death

## Critical Actions

1. **Stabilize the patient.** ABCs first. Abusive head trauma may present with apnea, seizures, or herniation. Manage airway and treat raised ICP per TBI protocols. Hemorrhagic shock from solid organ injury requires fluid resuscitation (NS 20 mL/kg bolus, repeat as needed) and blood products.
2. **Maintain high clinical suspicion.** The diagnosis is missed 30% of the time on first presentation. Any injury inconsistent with mechanism, developmental stage, or stated history warrants further evaluation. Do not accept implausible explanations.
3. **Skeletal survey — mandatory for all children < 2 years with suspected abuse.** Two-view radiographs of entire skeleton per AAP/ACR guidelines. Follow-up skeletal survey at 2 weeks detects healing occult fractures missed on initial study (increases yield by 25%).
4. **CT head — obtain for any concern of abusive head trauma in children < 1 year.** Non-contrast CT identifies acute subdural/epidural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral edema. MRI is more sensitive for diffuse axonal injury and posterior fossa lesions but is not the acute screening study.
5. **Dilated fundoscopic exam by ophthalmology.** Retinal hemorrhages are present in 85% of abusive head trauma cases. Must be performed by ophthalmology (direct ophthalmoscopy in the ED is insufficient for peripheral retinal evaluation).
6. **Report to CPS immediately.** Physicians are mandatory reporters in all 50 US states. Reporting requires reasonable suspicion, NOT certainty. Failure to report is a legal violation. Contact hospital social work and local CPS/law enforcement.
7. **Document meticulously.** Photograph all injuries with a measurement ruler. Document exact location, size, shape, color, and pattern of every injury. Record caregiver history verbatim (in quotes). Note developmental milestones (can the child roll, sit, crawl, walk?). Record time, date, and who provided the history.
8. **Do not discharge the child to the suspected abuser.** Ensure safe disposition. The child must not be released until CPS involvement and a safety plan are established.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Accidental trauma | History consistent with injury pattern and developmental stage; single mechanism; no delay in presentation; no prior concerning injuries |
| Osteogenesis imperfecta | Blue sclerae, wormian bones on skull films, osteopenia, family history, multiple fractures with minimal trauma; genetic testing confirms |
| Henoch-Schonlein purpura | Palpable purpura on buttocks/legs (may mimic bruising), arthritis, abdominal pain, renal involvement, normal coagulation studies |
| Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) | Petechiae and bruising, thrombocytopenia on CBC, no skeletal injuries |
| Coagulopathy (hemophilia, von Willebrand) | Excessive bruising/bleeding with minor trauma, prolonged PT/PTT, factor levels abnormal, no fractures |
| Mongolian spots | Blue-gray macules on buttocks/back in dark-skinned infants; present from birth, non-tender, flat (no swelling), fade over years |
| Vitamin D deficiency rickets | Metaphyseal changes on radiograph (cupping, fraying), low 25-OH vitamin D, elevated alkaline phosphatase, craniotabes |
| Ehlers-Danlos syndrome | Hypermobile joints, fragile skin, easy bruising, family history; no fracture pattern typical of abuse |
| Glutaric aciduria type 1 | Macrocephaly, subdural hematomas mimicking abusive head trauma, metabolic crisis; urine organic acids diagnostic |
| Birth trauma | Clavicle fracture, cephalohematoma — presents in neonatal period with documented delivery history |

## Workup

**Mandatory in All Suspected Abuse (children < 2 years):**
- **Skeletal survey (AAP/ACR protocol):** AP and lateral skull, AP chest, AP pelvis, AP bilateral humeri, AP bilateral forearms, AP bilateral femurs, AP bilateral tibiae/fibulae, lateral thoracolumbar spine, AP hands, AP feet. Follow-up survey at 2 weeks increases fracture detection by 25%.
- **CT head without contrast:** for any infant < 1 year with suspected abuse, or any child with neurologic signs, scalp swelling, or facial bruising
- **Ophthalmologic exam (dilated fundoscopy):** mandatory when abusive head trauma is suspected

**Laboratory Studies:**
- CBC with differential and platelet count (screen for hematologic disease)
- PT, PTT, INR, fibrinogen (exclude coagulopathy before attributing bruising to abuse)
- AST, ALT (screen for occult abdominal trauma — elevation > 80 IU/L warrants abdominal CT)
- Lipase (pancreatic injury screen)
- Urinalysis (hematuria suggesting renal/bladder injury)
- Alkaline phosphatase, calcium, phosphorus, 25-OH vitamin D (if rickets in differential)

**Additional Imaging as Indicated:**
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** if AST or ALT > 80, lipase elevated, hematuria, or abdominal tenderness/distension — occult abdominal injury present in 2-8% of physically abused children
- **MRI brain:** superior to CT for dating subdural hematomas, detecting diffuse axonal injury, and posterior fossa injury. Obtain after initial CT stabilization.
- **Bone scan:** rarely needed if skeletal survey is complete; may supplement for rib fractures or subtle diaphyseal injuries

**Documentation Workup:**
- Photograph all injuries with ruler for scale and color standard card
- Body map diagram marking all injuries
- Developmental assessment (Denver II or milestone checklist)
- Verbatim caregiver statements documented in medical record

## Treatment

**Acute Traumatic Injuries — treat per standard trauma protocols:**

*Abusive Head Trauma:*
- Airway management: RSI if GCS < 8 (etomidate 0.3 mg/kg IV or ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV + rocuronium 1 mg/kg IV)
- ICP management: head of bed 30 degrees, maintain midline head position, target PaCO2 35-40 mmHg (avoid prophylactic hyperventilation)
- Hypertonic saline 3%: 2-5 mL/kg IV over 10-20 minutes for signs of herniation
- Mannitol 0.5-1 g/kg IV over 20 minutes (alternative to hypertonic saline for herniation)
- Seizure treatment: levetiracetam 40-60 mg/kg IV (max 4500 mg) or fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg IV
- Neurosurgical consultation for surgical subdural hematoma evacuation

*Hemorrhagic Shock (solid organ injury):*
- NS 20 mL/kg bolus, repeat up to 3 times
- Packed RBCs 10 mL/kg if no response to crystalloid
- Activate massive transfusion protocol if hemodynamically unstable
- Surgical consultation for operative abdominal injury

*Fracture Management:*
- Splint/immobilize acute fractures
- Pain management: acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO/PR q4h (max 75 mg/kg/day), ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO q6h (> 6 months), morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q3-4h or fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV q1-2h for severe pain
- Orthopedic consultation for operative fractures

*Burns:*
- Immersion burns: cool running water for 20 minutes, sterile dressings
- Burn center referral criteria per ABA guidelines (> 10% TBSA partial thickness, full thickness, or circumferential)

**Psychosocial/Safety Interventions (concurrent with medical care):**
- Activate child protection team or hospital social work
- CPS report filed by treating physician (mandatory reporter obligation)
- Law enforcement notification as per local protocol
- Sibling evaluation — siblings of abused children must also be assessed (skeletal survey if < 2 years)
- Ensure safe disposition before discharge planning begins

## Disposition

**Admission (majority of cases):**
- Any child with acute injuries requiring medical management (head injury, fractures, abdominal injury, burns)
- Any child in whom safe discharge cannot be assured (CPS has not cleared the home environment)
- Pending completion of workup (skeletal survey, ophthalmologic exam, lab evaluation)
- Neurosurgical ICU for abusive head trauma with altered consciousness, expanding subdural, or signs of raised ICP
- PICU for hemodynamic instability, multisystem injury, or need for close monitoring

**Hospital-Based Observation:**
- Even with minor injuries, admission is appropriate if the child cannot be safely discharged or workup is pending
- CPS and social work must be involved before any discharge

**Discharge (only when ALL of the following are met):**
- Medical workup complete and injuries treated
- CPS investigation initiated and safety plan in place
- Child is not being discharged to the suspected abuser
- Appropriate follow-up arranged (primary care within 48-72 hours, subspecialty as needed)
- Clear return precautions given to safe caregiver

**Never Discharge:**
- To the suspected abuser
- Before CPS notification and safety assessment
- Before skeletal survey and appropriate workup are completed

## Pitfalls

1. **Accepting an implausible mechanism of injury.** The most common reason for missed child abuse is accepting a history that does not match the injury pattern. A 3-month-old cannot roll off a bed, grab a hot stove, or "bruise easily." Developmental stage must be reconciled with the stated mechanism for every injury. If the story does not match, pursue a workup for abuse regardless of caregiver demeanor.

2. **Not considering abuse in well-appearing children with isolated fractures.** A well-dressed child with attentive parents can still be an abuse victim. Abuse crosses all socioeconomic, racial, and educational boundaries. An isolated femur fracture in a non-ambulatory infant, a posterior rib fracture on incidental chest X-ray, or a metaphyseal corner fracture found on imaging for another complaint all require a full abuse workup.

3. **Failing to perform a skeletal survey in children under 2.** Occult fractures in various stages of healing are the hallmark of physical abuse. Plain films of the presenting injury alone miss additional fractures in 11-25% of cases. A full skeletal survey per ACR/AAP guidelines is mandatory for all children < 2 years with suspected abuse, and a follow-up survey at 2 weeks identifies an additional 25% of fractures missed initially.

4. **Attributing bruising in non-mobile infants to normal activity.** "Those who don't cruise rarely bruise." Bruising in a non-ambulatory infant (< 6 months, or any child not yet pulling to stand/cruising) is abuse until proven otherwise. The TEN-4 rule — bruising on the Torso, Ear, or Neck in a child < 4 years, or ANY bruising in an infant < 4 months — has 97% sensitivity for identifying abusive bruising.

5. **Not obtaining screening labs to exclude medical mimics.** Coagulopathies (hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, ITP), metabolic bone disease (rickets, osteogenesis imperfecta), and glutaric aciduria can mimic abuse. A basic coagulation panel (PT, PTT, fibrinogen, platelet count) is mandatory before attributing bruising to inflicted injury. Failure to exclude medical causes weakens the legal case and puts an innocent family at risk.

6. **Omitting hepatic transaminases in the abuse workup.** Occult abdominal injury is present in 2-8% of physically abused children and is the second leading cause of child abuse death. AST and ALT elevations > 80 IU/L have high sensitivity for hepatic/pancreatic injury. Without screening labs, duodenal hematoma, hepatic laceration, and pancreatic injury are missed until the child decompensates.

7. **Failing to report to CPS.** Physicians are mandatory reporters in all 50 US states. The legal threshold is reasonable suspicion, not diagnostic certainty. Fear of being wrong, discomfort with confrontation, or reluctance to "accuse" a family does not override the legal and ethical obligation. Failure to report exposes the child to ongoing abuse (25-50% re-injury rate) and exposes the physician to legal liability.

8. **Not evaluating siblings.** If one child in a household is abused, siblings are at high risk. AAP guidelines recommend evaluation of all children in the home, including skeletal survey for siblings < 2 years. Failing to evaluate siblings leaves vulnerable children in a dangerous environment.

9. **Anchoring on a single injury and missing the pattern.** Abuse is rarely a single event. A child presenting with a forearm fracture may also have healing rib fractures, retinal hemorrhages, or abdominal organ injury not evident on focused exam. A comprehensive head-to-toe examination with clothing fully removed, complete skeletal survey, hepatic transaminases, and urinalysis are needed to identify the full extent of injury.

10. **Inadequate documentation undermining the legal case.** Child abuse cases go to court. Vague documentation ("bruise on arm," "child fell") is insufficient. Every injury must be photographed with a ruler, mapped on a body diagram, and described precisely (location, size, shape, color, tenderness, pattern). Caregiver statements must be recorded verbatim in quotation marks. The developmental assessment must be documented. Poor documentation undermines prosecution and child protection.
