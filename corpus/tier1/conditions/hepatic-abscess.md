# Hepatic Abscess

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Fever (most common presenting symptom — 90%), often spiking with rigors
- RUQ pain (50-75%), may radiate to right shoulder
- Malaise, anorexia, weight loss (subacute course over days to weeks)
- Jaundice (25%) — suggests biliary source or large abscess compressing bile ducts
- Cough, right pleuritic pain (if adjacent to diaphragm)

**Types:**
- **Pyogenic (80% in developed countries):** polymicrobial (E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, Bacteroides, Enterococcus); Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KPLA) — invasive K. pneumoniae K1/K2 serotype, common in East/Southeast Asia, diabetics; metastatic septic spread to eyes, brain
- **Amebic (Entamoeba histolytica):** travel/exposure to endemic area, younger male patients, single large abscess usually right lobe; diarrhea may precede
- **Fungal (Candida):** immunocompromised patients (neutropenic recovery phase), multiple small abscesses

**Sources of pyogenic abscess:**
- Biliary (40-50%): choledocholithiasis, biliary stricture, stent/ERCP complications
- Portal vein (pylephlebitis): appendicitis, diverticulitis, IBD
- Hepatic artery: endocarditis, bacteremia
- Direct extension: cholecystitis, subhepatic abscess
- Cryptogenic (15-20%): consider occult GI malignancy (especially colon)

**Exam findings:**
- RUQ tenderness, hepatomegaly
- Fever, tachycardia
- Right basilar decreased breath sounds (sympathetic pleural effusion)
- Jaundice (if biliary obstruction)
- Peritoneal signs suggest rupture — emergent intervention

## Critical Actions

1. **Blood cultures (x2 sets)** before antibiotics
2. **Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics immediately:**
   - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (covers polymicrobial pyogenic)
   - Add metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h if amebic abscess suspected (travel history, endemic exposure)
3. **CT abdomen with IV contrast** — characterize abscess, guide drainage
4. **Interventional radiology consultation** for percutaneous drainage of abscess ≥ 5 cm
5. **Entamoeba serology** (IgG) if travel history or amebic abscess suspected
6. **NPO if peritoneal signs or surgery anticipated**
7. **Evaluate for underlying source** — biliary imaging, colonoscopy (after acute phase)

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Hepatocellular carcinoma** — chronic liver disease, elevated AFP, arterial enhancement on CT
- **Hepatic cyst (simple or infected)** — thin-walled, no internal septations; infected cyst mimics abscess
- **Hepatic hemangioma** — characteristic peripheral nodular enhancement on contrast CT
- **Cholangitis** — Charcot triad (fever, jaundice, RUQ pain); CBD dilation on imaging
- **Acute cholecystitis** — GB wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, positive Murphy sign
- **Right lower lobe pneumonia/empyema** — cough, abnormal CXR, pleuritic pain
- **Subhepatic/subdiaphragmatic abscess** — post-surgical, inferior to liver on CT
- **Echinococcal (hydatid) cyst** — endemic exposure, calcified wall, daughter cysts; do NOT aspirate without antihelminthic pretreatment

## Workup

- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (gold standard):**
  - Hypodense lesion(s) with peripheral rim enhancement
  - Internal septations, gas (pyogenic)
  - Cluster sign (coalescent microabscesses)
  - Perilesional edema, right pleural effusion
  - Assess for biliary dilation, portal vein thrombosis (pylephlebitis)
  - Sensitivity > 95%
- **Ultrasound (RUQ):**
  - Useful for initial evaluation and guided aspiration
  - Hypoechoic or heterogeneous lesion with debris
  - May miss small or isoechoic lesions
- **Labs:** CBC (leukocytosis, left shift), BMP, hepatic panel (elevated ALP, GGT; transaminases mildly elevated), blood cultures x2, CRP/ESR (markedly elevated), Entamoeba histolytica serology (IgG — sensitivity > 95% for invasive amebiasis)
- **Aspirate analysis:** Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic cultures, cytology (exclude malignancy), amebic trophozoites (rarely seen; "anchovy paste" aspirate classic for amebic)
- **CXR:** right pleural effusion, elevated right hemidiaphragm (50%)
- **Colonoscopy:** after acute phase to exclude colon malignancy (cryptogenic pyogenic abscess in age > 50)
- **Echocardiography:** if endocarditis suspected as source

## Treatment

**Pyogenic liver abscess:**
- **Antibiotics (empiric):**
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (first-line)
  - OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h (if ESBL risk or treatment failure)
  - Add vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q12h if MRSA suspected
  - Duration: IV antibiotics for 2-3 weeks, then transition to oral for total 4-6 weeks
  - Oral step-down: amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID or ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID + metronidazole 500 mg PO TID
- **Drainage:**
  - Abscess ≥ 5 cm: CT- or US-guided percutaneous needle aspiration or catheter drainage
  - Catheter drainage preferred for abscesses > 5 cm (higher success rate than needle aspiration alone)
  - Abscess < 5 cm: may respond to antibiotics alone; aspirate for culture
  - Multi-loculated or failed percutaneous drainage: surgical drainage (laparoscopic or open)
- **Source control:** address underlying biliary pathology (ERCP for CBD stones, stent for stricture)

**Amebic liver abscess:**
- Metronidazole 750 mg IV/PO TID x 7-10 days (first-line)
- PLUS luminal agent: paromomycin 25-35 mg/kg/day PO divided TID x 7 days (eliminate intestinal carriage)
- Most amebic abscesses respond to metronidazole alone without drainage
- Drain if: > 10 cm, left lobe (rupture risk into pericardium), no clinical improvement at 5-7 days, or imminent rupture

**Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess (KPLA):**
- Third-generation cephalosporin: ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily
- Screen for metastatic complications: ophthalmology exam (endophthalmitis), brain imaging if neurologic symptoms
- Drainage per standard indications

## Disposition

- **Admit all patients** with newly diagnosed hepatic abscess
- **ICU:** sepsis, hemodynamic instability, ruptured abscess with peritonitis
- **IR drainage** within 24 hours for abscesses ≥ 5 cm
- **Transition to oral antibiotics** when afebrile x 48 hours, tolerating PO, WBC normalizing
- **Follow-up imaging** at 4-6 weeks (CT or US) to document resolution
- **Colonoscopy** after discharge in patients > 50 with cryptogenic pyogenic abscess

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing Klebsiella pneumoniae invasive syndrome.** K. pneumoniae liver abscess (especially K1/K2 serotype) metastasizes to eyes (endophthalmitis → blindness) and CNS. Screen diabetic patients with KPLA with ophthalmology exam and neurologic assessment.

2. **Aspirating an echinococcal cyst mistaken for abscess.** Unprotected aspiration of hydatid cyst causes anaphylaxis and peritoneal seeding. If there is any concern for echinococcus (endemic exposure, calcified wall, daughter cysts), obtain Echinococcus serology BEFORE aspiration.

3. **Insufficient antibiotic duration.** Hepatic abscesses require prolonged therapy (4-6 weeks total). Premature discontinuation leads to recurrence. Follow CRP and imaging to guide duration.

4. **Failing to evaluate for underlying GI malignancy.** Cryptogenic pyogenic liver abscess in patients > 50 is associated with occult colorectal cancer. Colonoscopy after acute phase is mandatory.

5. **Not adding a luminal agent after treating amebic abscess.** Metronidazole alone does not eradicate intestinal colonization. Paromomycin is required to prevent relapse. Omission is the most common error in amebic abscess management.

6. **Treating amebic abscess with drainage first.** Unlike pyogenic abscesses, most amebic abscesses respond to metronidazole alone. Drainage is reserved for large (> 10 cm), left-lobe (pericardial rupture risk), or refractory abscesses.
