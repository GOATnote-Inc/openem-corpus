# Cauda Equina Syndrome

## Recognition

**Definition:** Compression of the lumbosacral nerve roots (L2-S5) below the conus medullaris (which terminates at L1-L2), causing a constellation of lower extremity motor/sensory deficits, bladder/bowel dysfunction, and saddle anesthesia. This is a **surgical emergency**.

**Clinical Subtypes:**
- **CES-Incomplete (CESI):** Urinary difficulties (altered sensation, poor stream, need to strain) WITHOUT retention. Better surgical prognosis.
- **CES-Retention (CESR):** Painless urinary retention with overflow incontinence. Worse prognosis — represents more advanced compression.

**Cardinal Features:**
- **Saddle anesthesia** — decreased/absent sensation in perineum, perianal region, medial thighs (S2-S5 dermatomes). Test with pinprick bilaterally and compare.
- **Urinary retention** — post-void residual (PVR) >200 mL on bladder scan. Painless retention with overflow incontinence is a late finding.
- **Bilateral lower extremity weakness** — variable; may involve multiple myotomes (L2-S1). Test ankle dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, knee extension, hip flexion.
- **Decreased rectal tone** — perform digital rectal exam (DRE); absent or markedly diminished voluntary anal sphincter contraction.
- **Sexual dysfunction** — erectile dysfunction, loss of genital sensation (ask directly).
- **Bilateral radiculopathy** — sciatica in both legs, often asymmetric.
- **Fecal incontinence** — late finding.

**Red Flag Presentations:**
- Acute back pain with new urinary retention
- Bilateral sciatica (especially with progressive weakness)
- Any back pain patient who "can't urinate"
- Post-procedural (epidural, spinal surgery) progressive weakness

**Causes:**
- Massive lumbar disc herniation (most common, 45%)
- Spinal epidural abscess
- Spinal epidural hematoma (anticoagulated patients, post-procedural)
- Spinal tumor/metastasis
- Spinal stenosis (chronic, with acute decompensation)
- Trauma with fracture-dislocation

## Critical Actions

1. **Bladder scan immediately** in any patient with back pain and urinary symptoms. PVR >200 mL is abnormal and mandates further evaluation.
2. **Digital rectal exam** — document rectal tone. Absent voluntary sphincter contraction is a highly specific finding.
3. **Perineal sensation testing** — map saddle area bilaterally with pinprick. Document precisely.
4. **Emergent MRI of the entire lumbar spine** without and with gadolinium. This is the gold standard. Must image the entire lumbosacral region, not just a single level.
5. **Emergent neurosurgery or spine surgery consultation** — call before MRI results if clinical suspicion is high. Do not wait for imaging to initiate the consult.
6. **Foley catheter** — for urinary retention, decompress the bladder. Document PVR before catheter placement.
7. **Dexamethasone 10 mg IV** if tumor or abscess suspected as etiology (limited evidence for disc herniation; no harm in giving while awaiting imaging).
8. **Serial neurological exams** — document motor strength, sensation, and rectal tone at each reassessment. Progression changes surgical urgency.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Conus medullaris syndrome | Upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, Babinski), more symmetric, sudden onset, earlier/more severe bladder dysfunction, conus ends at L1-L2. CES = lower motor neuron (hyporeflexia, flaccid). |
| Lumbar radiculopathy (single root) | Unilateral, single dermatomal pattern, no bowel/bladder dysfunction, no saddle anesthesia |
| Spinal epidural abscess | Fever, point tenderness, elevated WBC/ESR/CRP, IV drug use, recent procedure. Can cause CES. |
| Transverse myelitis | Upper motor neuron signs, sensory level, cord involvement on MRI, often thoracic |
| Guillain-Barre syndrome | Ascending weakness, areflexia, no back pain, albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF |
| Peripheral neuropathy | Chronic, symmetric, distal-to-proximal gradient, no acute back pain |
| Urinary retention from other cause | Medications (anticholinergics, opioids), BPH, UTI — no saddle anesthesia or weakness |

## Workup

**Mandatory:**
- **MRI lumbar spine (entire lumbosacral region)** — gold standard. Sagittal and axial T1, T2, and STIR sequences. Add gadolinium if infection or tumor suspected. Must include conus medullaris.
- **Post-void residual (bladder scan)** — PVR >200 mL abnormal, >500 mL strongly suggestive.
- **Detailed neurological exam documented:** bilateral lower extremity motor (L2-S1 myotomes), sensation (light touch and pinprick in saddle distribution), rectal tone, ankle reflexes, bulbocavernosus reflex.

**Labs:**
- CBC, BMP, coagulation studies
- ESR, CRP — if epidural abscess suspected
- Blood cultures — if febrile
- Urinalysis — rule out UTI as confounding cause of urinary symptoms

**If MRI unavailable or contraindicated:**
- CT myelogram — adequate alternative, requires intrathecal contrast
- Do NOT substitute plain CT or X-ray — insufficient sensitivity

**Medicolegal Documentation:**
- CES is the most commonly missed surgical emergency in litigation. Document: time of symptom onset, PVR measurement, rectal tone, perineal sensation, time neurosurgery contacted, time of MRI.

## Treatment

**Definitive Treatment: Surgical Decompression**
- Emergent laminectomy/discectomy within **24 hours** of symptom onset for best outcomes
- Acceptable window: within **48 hours**, but outcomes decline progressively with delay
- CES-Incomplete (CESI): 70% full recovery if decompressed within 24 hours vs 30% if delayed >48 hours
- CES-Retention (CESR): worse baseline prognosis; 30-50% have persistent bladder dysfunction even with timely surgery

**Pre-Operative Management:**
- Foley catheter for retention
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV (if tumor or inflammatory etiology)
- IV antibiotics if epidural abscess: vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose + ceftriaxone 2 g IV (or meropenem 2 g IV if concern for resistant organisms) — do NOT delay antibiotics for MRI
- Pain management: avoid excessive opioids that confound neurological exam. Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV, acetaminophen 1 g IV. Low-dose opioid if needed (morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV titrated).
- DVT prophylaxis (mechanical) — hold chemical prophylaxis pending surgery

**If Surgery Delayed or Unavailable:**
- Transfer emergently to facility with spine surgery capability
- Maintain serial neurological exams during transfer
- Document all times meticulously

## Disposition

**Emergent Surgical Admission:**
- All confirmed CES requires emergent spine surgery consultation and admission
- Transfer to a surgical facility immediately if spine surgery not available on-site. Do NOT wait for outpatient follow-up.

**ICU Admission:**
- Post-operative monitoring after emergent decompression
- Epidural abscess with sepsis
- Epidural hematoma with coagulopathy requiring reversal

**Patients NOT Requiring Emergent Surgery:**
- Isolated unilateral radiculopathy without bladder/bowel dysfunction and normal PVR — can be managed as urgent outpatient if close follow-up assured
- Chronic lumbar stenosis with stable symptoms and normal PVR — non-emergent

**Discharge Instructions (for patients evaluated and cleared):**
- Return immediately for: inability to urinate, new numbness in groin/perineum, loss of bowel control, progressive leg weakness, new sexual dysfunction
- Written "CES precautions" on discharge paperwork

## Pitfalls

1. **Failing to check a post-void residual.** Patients with back pain who report urinary difficulty need a bladder scan. "I went to the bathroom" does not exclude retention — overflow incontinence produces small voids while the bladder retains 500+ mL. PVR is the objective test.

2. **Performing rectal exam but not documenting it.** Absent rectal tone is a critical finding. Failing to document the DRE (or not performing it at all) is the single most common medicolegal failure in CES malpractice cases.

3. **Waiting for MRI to call the surgeon.** If clinical suspicion is high, contact neurosurgery/spine surgery immediately. Surgical scheduling and OR preparation take time. Parallel processing (MRI happening while surgeon is being mobilized) saves hours.

4. **Ordering MRI of only one level.** CES can result from pathology at multiple levels or from a single large herniation that is not at the clinically suspected level. Order MRI of the entire lumbosacral spine.

5. **Confusing CES with conus medullaris syndrome.** Conus lesions (at L1-L2 level) produce upper motor neuron findings (hyperreflexia, Babinski), early severe bladder dysfunction, and more symmetric involvement. CES (below L2) produces lower motor neuron findings (hyporeflexia, flaccid paralysis), asymmetric radiculopathy. Both are surgical emergencies, but the distinction guides imaging and surgical approach.

6. **Dismissing bilateral sciatica as "just a bad back."** Bilateral radiculopathy is never routine. Combined with any urinary complaint, this presentation demands MRI and PVR immediately.

7. **Attributing urinary retention to medications or age.** Opioids and anticholinergics cause retention, as does BPH. However, new retention in any patient with back pain requires CES evaluation before attributing it to another cause. The cost of missing CES is permanent disability.

8. **Accepting incomplete resolution after decompression without long-term follow-up.** Patients with persistent bladder dysfunction after CES decompression need urology referral, intermittent catheterization teaching, and rehabilitation. Failure to arrange follow-up compounds the initial injury.

9. **Discharging a patient with back pain and "normal" exam without CES return precautions.** Disc herniations can progress. Every back pain discharge should include written instructions to return for inability to urinate, perineal numbness, bowel incontinence, or progressive bilateral weakness.
