# Fournier's Gangrene

> **See also:** [necrotizing-fasciitis](necrotizing-fasciitis.md) for general NSTI management. This file covers features specific to the perineal/genital variant.

## Recognition

**Definition:** Necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum, perianal region, and external genitalia. Polymicrobial synergistic infection (Type I NSTI) involving gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms spreading along Colles fascia, Dartos fascia, and Scarpa fascia. Rapidly progressive; can spread to anterior abdominal wall, thighs, and retroperitoneum within hours.

**Epidemiology:**
- Male:female ratio approximately 10:1
- Peak incidence age 50-70
- Overall mortality 20-40%; mortality with delayed surgery exceeds 50-80%
- Incidence increasing — attributed to rising diabetes and obesity prevalence

**Microbiology (polymicrobial in >80% of cases):**
- Gram-positive: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus species, Enterococcus
- Gram-negative: Escherichia coli (most common single isolate), Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Proteus
- Anaerobes: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus
- Average 3-5 organisms per wound culture

**Common Sources of Infection:**
- Anorectal (30-50%): perianal/perirectal abscess, fistula-in-ano, hemorrhoidectomy, rectal perforation
- Urogenital (20-40%): urethral stricture, urethral instrumentation, epididymitis, urinary tract infection, indwelling catheter
- Dermatologic (20%): scrotal/vulvar abscess, perineal skin infection, hidradenitis suppurativa
- Idiopathic (10-20%): no identifiable source

**Risk Factors:**
- Diabetes mellitus (60-70% of patients — most significant risk factor)
- Chronic alcoholism / alcohol use disorder
- Immunosuppression (HIV, chemotherapy, chronic steroids, transplant recipients)
- Obesity
- Peripheral vascular disease
- Chronic renal failure / dialysis
- Chronic liver disease / cirrhosis
- Malignancy
- Recent perineal surgery or instrumentation

**Clinical Features — Early:**
- Perineal, scrotal, or vulvar pain — often severe and out of proportion to visible findings
- Swelling, erythema, and tenderness of perineum/genitalia
- Fever, malaise
- May be misdiagnosed as simple abscess, cellulitis, epididymitis, or orchitis at this stage

**Clinical Features — Progressive (hours to days):**
- Rapidly spreading erythema extending beyond initial borders
- Dusky or necrotic skin patches, hemorrhagic bullae
- Crepitus on palpation (subcutaneous gas — present in 19-64% of cases)
- Scrotal/vulvar edema and induration disproportionate to visible skin changes
- Foul-smelling wound drainage ("dishwater" gray)
- Skin anesthesia over affected area (nerve destruction)
- Systemic sepsis: tachycardia, hypotension, altered mental status, multiorgan failure

**Fournier's Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI):**
- Uses 9 parameters: temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, sodium, potassium, creatinine, bicarbonate, hematocrit, WBC
- Score >9: 75% mortality. Score <=9: 78% survival.
- Supplements but does not replace clinical judgment

**LRINEC Score:**
- CRP >= 150 mg/L (4 pts), WBC 15-25 (1 pt) or >25 (2 pts), Hgb 11-13.5 (1 pt) or <11 (2 pts), Na <135 (2 pts), Creatinine >1.6 (2 pts), Glucose >180 (1 pt)
- Score >=6: high suspicion (PPV 92%). Score >=8: strongly predictive.
- Sensitivity only 68-80% — a low score does NOT exclude Fournier's gangrene.

## Critical Actions

1. **Recognize early** — suspect Fournier's gangrene in any patient with perineal/genital pain, swelling, or erythema plus systemic toxicity, especially with diabetes or immunosuppression. Examine the perineum. Patients may not volunteer genital complaints.

2. **Emergent surgical consultation** — call surgery (urology, general surgery, or colorectal) immediately. Do NOT delay for imaging or labs. Surgical debridement within 6 hours is the target; every hour of delay increases mortality.

3. **Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics** — start immediately:
   - Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose (MRSA coverage; target AUC/MIC 400-600)
   - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (gram-negative and anaerobic coverage)
   - Clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h (toxin suppression — inhibits exotoxin and superantigen production)

4. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation** — large-volume crystalloid (LR or NS) targeting MAP >=65 mmHg and UOP >=0.5 mL/kg/hr. Vasopressors (norepinephrine first-line) for refractory septic shock.

5. **Obtain labs** — CBC, CMP, CRP, lactate, blood cultures x2, coagulation studies, blood gas. Calculate LRINEC score and FGSI.

6. **CT imaging if diagnosis uncertain** — CT with IV contrast can demonstrate fascial gas, fascial thickening, fluid collections, and fat stranding extending along fascial planes. Imaging must NOT delay surgical intervention when clinical suspicion is high.

7. **Pain management** — IV opioids titrated to effect. Severe pain requiring escalating doses supports the diagnosis.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Perianal/scrotal abscess | Localized, fluctuant, no fascial plane involvement, no systemic toxicity, pain proportional to exam |
| Cellulitis of perineum | Pain proportional to findings, no crepitus, no skin necrosis, responds to antibiotics, no rapid spread |
| Epididymo-orchitis | Testicular tenderness and swelling, positive Prehn sign, pyuria, no perineal skin changes |
| Testicular torsion | Acute onset, absent cremasteric reflex, abnormal Doppler flow, no skin necrosis or crepitus |
| Incarcerated/strangulated inguinal hernia | Groin mass, bowel obstruction symptoms, no perineal skin necrosis |
| Necrotizing fasciitis (non-perineal) | Same pathology at different anatomic site — see [necrotizing-fasciitis](necrotizing-fasciitis.md) |
| Allergic angioedema of genitalia | Symmetric, non-tender swelling, no erythema or necrosis, no fever, history of allergen exposure |
| Calciphylaxis (perineal) | ESRD patients, reticular purpura, chronic course, no acute sepsis initially |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- CBC — leukocytosis (WBC >15,000) or leukopenia (poor prognostic sign)
- CMP — hyponatremia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia (uncontrolled diabetes common)
- CRP — markedly elevated (>150 mg/L)
- Lactate — elevated in sepsis/tissue ischemia; lactate >4 mmol/L is a poor prognostic marker
- Blood cultures x2 — positive in 20-40%
- Coagulation studies, fibrinogen — DIC screening (thrombocytopenia, elevated INR, low fibrinogen)
- Blood gas — metabolic acidosis
- Procalcitonin — elevated; supports infectious etiology
- Calculate LRINEC score and FGSI

**Imaging (do NOT delay surgery for imaging):**
- **CT with IV contrast (most useful):** Asymmetric fascial thickening, fat stranding in perineum, subcutaneous gas tracking along fascial planes, fluid collections. Sensitivity 80-100% for established disease. Defines extent of spread (thighs, abdominal wall, retroperitoneum).
- **Plain radiograph:** Subcutaneous gas in perineum (specific but insensitive).
- **Point-of-care ultrasound:** Subcutaneous gas (dirty shadowing/reverberation artifact), fascial thickening >4 mm, "cobblestoning." Rapid bedside adjunct. Can differentiate simple abscess from NSTI.
- **MRI:** Most sensitive but too time-consuming for unstable patients. Reserve for diagnostic uncertainty in stable patients.

**Wound cultures:** Obtain intraoperatively from debrided tissue (not superficial swabs). Guides antibiotic de-escalation.

## Treatment

**Antibiotics (start immediately — do not wait for cultures or imaging):**
- **Empiric regimen:** Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose, then 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (MRSA coverage; target AUC/MIC 400-600) + piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h (gram-negative and anaerobic coverage) + clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h (toxin suppression)
- **Alternative:** Vancomycin + meropenem 1 g IV q8h + clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h
- **Penicillin allergy:** Vancomycin + aztreonam 2 g IV q8h + metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h + clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h
- **Antifungal coverage** if immunocompromised or broad-spectrum antibiotic failure: micafungin 100 mg IV daily or fluconazole 400 mg IV daily
- Narrow antibiotics based on operative cultures and sensitivities

**Surgical Debridement:**
- Emergent wide excision of all necrotic tissue — debride aggressively until healthy, bleeding tissue is reached at all margins
- Exploration must include perineum, scrotum/labia, perianal region, and extend to thighs/abdominal wall as needed
- Orchiectomy is rarely necessary — testes have independent blood supply (testicular artery) and are usually spared despite scrotal skin loss
- Planned re-exploration at 24-48 hours (second-look surgery mandatory)
- Average 3-4 debridements per patient; some require >6
- Wound VAC (negative pressure wound therapy) after wound bed is clean — accelerates granulation tissue formation

**Urinary Diversion:**
- Suprapubic catheter if urethral involvement or extensive perineal wound compromises urethral catheter integrity
- Foley catheter acceptable if urethra is uninvolved

**Fecal Diversion:**
- Diverting colostomy when: extensive perianal/rectal involvement, fecal contamination of wound compromises healing, anal sphincter destruction
- Not routine for all cases — decision made by surgical team

**Supportive Care:**
- ICU admission with invasive monitoring
- Fluid resuscitation — target MAP >=65 mmHg, UOP >=0.5 mL/kg/hr
- Vasopressors — norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV first-line; add vasopressin 0.03 units/min if refractory
- Blood product resuscitation as needed (massive tissue loss, DIC)
- Nutritional support — high-protein, high-calorie diet; enteral nutrition preferred. Massive protein losses from open wounds.
- Glycemic control — insulin infusion for hyperglycemia; uncontrolled diabetes worsens outcomes

**Adjuncts (limited evidence):**
- Hyperbaric oxygen — some observational data suggests reduced mortality and fewer debridements. Should never delay surgical debridement. Not available at all centers.
- IVIG — no established role in polymicrobial Fournier's gangrene (unlike monomicrobial GAS NSTI).

## Disposition

**All patients require ICU admission and emergent surgical intervention.**

**Mortality Predictors:**
- Age >60
- Diabetes with poor glycemic control
- Delay to surgery >12 hours
- Extent of disease at presentation (involvement beyond perineum)
- Septic shock at presentation
- WBC >30,000 or <4,000
- Creatinine >2 mg/dL
- Lactate >4 mmol/L
- FGSI >9
- Female sex (higher mortality in some series, possibly due to delayed diagnosis)

**Transfer:** If current facility lacks surgical capability for wide perineal debridement and ICU care, stabilize with antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasopressors, then emergent transfer. Do not delay transfer for imaging.

**Long-term Considerations:**
- Multiple staged debridements, wound VAC therapy, skin grafting (split-thickness skin grafts, scrotal advancement flaps, gracilis myocutaneous flaps)
- Colostomy reversal and urinary diversion removal when wounds are healed
- Physical therapy and rehabilitation
- Psychological support — perineal and genital disfigurement causes significant body image distress; sexual dysfunction is common
- Long-term wound care follow-up

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosing Fournier's gangrene as a simple perianal or scrotal abscess.** Early Fournier's gangrene mimics a benign abscess — localized swelling, redness, tenderness. The distinguishing features are pain out of proportion, rapid spread beyond initial margins, systemic toxicity (fever, tachycardia, hypotension), and crepitus. Any perineal "abscess" with disproportionate pain or systemic illness warrants further evaluation.

2. **Discharging a diabetic patient with perineal cellulitis on oral antibiotics.** Diabetes is present in 60-70% of Fournier's gangrene patients. A diabetic patient with perineal erythema, pain, and swelling that is not clearly a simple, drainable abscess requires close follow-up or admission. Worsening despite oral antibiotics mandates return and reassessment for NSTI.

3. **Failing to examine the perineum.** Patients may present with sepsis, abdominal pain, groin pain, or hip pain without volunteering genital symptoms due to embarrassment or altered mental status. The perineum must be examined in any septic patient with pelvic, groin, or perianal complaints. Fournier's gangrene is frequently diagnosed late because the perineum was not inspected.

4. **Waiting for CT results before consulting surgery.** CT is useful to define the extent of disease and detect fascial gas, but it must not delay surgical consultation. CT sensitivity is imperfect for early disease. If clinical suspicion is high — consult surgery first, image second.

5. **Relying on absence of crepitus to exclude the diagnosis.** Crepitus (subcutaneous gas) is present in only 19-64% of cases depending on the series. Many patients with confirmed Fournier's gangrene have no palpable crepitus. Absence of crepitus does not rule out the diagnosis.

6. **Omitting clindamycin from the antibiotic regimen.** Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis, suppressing exotoxin and superantigen production. This is critical for toxin-mediated organ damage. Standard beta-lactams kill bacteria but do not inhibit toxin production. Clindamycin must be included alongside vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam.

7. **Assuming the testes need to be removed.** Testicular loss is rare in Fournier's gangrene because the testes derive their blood supply from the testicular arteries (originating from the aorta), which are independent of the scrotal/perineal vasculature. Extensive scrotal skin necrosis does not imply testicular necrosis. Orchiectomy is indicated only if the testes are directly involved (rare).

8. **Not planning a second-look surgery at 24-48 hours.** Margins of viable vs. necrotic tissue are difficult to define at initial debridement, especially in the perineum. Planned re-exploration at 24-48 hours is standard of care. Patients deteriorating postoperatively may need earlier return to OR.

9. **Underestimating fluid requirements.** Fournier's gangrene patients develop profound septic shock with massive third-space losses from extensive soft tissue destruction. They frequently require aggressive volume resuscitation exceeding standard sepsis protocols, plus early vasopressor support.

10. **Anchoring on a urologic diagnosis in male patients.** Scrotal swelling with fever may be attributed to epididymitis or orchitis. Unlike epididymitis, Fournier's gangrene produces perineal/scrotal skin changes (erythema, induration, necrosis), pain extending beyond the testicle to the perineum, and systemic toxicity disproportionate to a simple urinary tract infection.
