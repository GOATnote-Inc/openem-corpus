# Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Acute/subacute onset (days) of polyfocal neurologic deficits preceded by viral illness (1-4 weeks prior) or vaccination
- Encephalopathy (required for diagnosis): altered consciousness, behavioral change, confusion, irritability
- Multifocal deficits: optic neuritis, hemiparesis, ataxia, cranial nerve palsies, myelitis (paraparesis, sensory level, bladder dysfunction)
- Fever common at onset
- Predominantly affects children (median age 5-8 years) but occurs in adults

**Diagnostic criteria (International Pediatric MS Study Group):**
- First polyfocal CNS event with presumed inflammatory demyelinating cause
- Encephalopathy NOT explained by fever
- No prior clinical CNS demyelination events
- MRI: large (>1-2 cm), multifocal, bilateral T2/FLAIR white matter lesions; may enhance; thalamic/basal ganglia involvement supports ADEM over MS
- No new MRI lesions >= 3 months after onset (distinguishes from MS)

**Variants:**
- Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE/Hurst disease): hyperacute, fulminant; hemorrhagic lesions on MRI; high mortality
- Multiphasic ADEM: recurrence of ADEM criteria with new symptoms > 3 months after initial event

## Critical Actions

1. **MRI brain and spine with gadolinium** — demonstrates multifocal white matter lesions; essential for diagnosis
2. **IV methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg/day (max 1 g/day) for 3-5 days** — first-line; start empirically if clinical suspicion high
3. **Secure airway** if GCS declining or bulbar dysfunction present
4. **LP** — exclude meningitis/encephalitis; CSF may show mild pleocytosis and elevated protein
5. **Neurology consultation** — urgent
6. **MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG antibodies** — send early; MOG+ ADEM has higher relapse risk

## Differential Diagnosis

- Bacterial or viral meningitis/encephalitis (fever, CSF culture/PCR)
- Multiple sclerosis (older age, monofocal, no encephalopathy, periventricular Dawson fingers)
- Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMO/NMOSD) (optic neuritis + longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis; AQP4-IgG positive)
- CNS vasculitis (multifocal infarcts, vessel wall enhancement)
- Acute ischemic stroke (arterial territory; DWI restriction)
- Brain abscess (ring-enhancing lesion, fever)
- CNS lymphoma (periventricular, homogeneous enhancement)
- Autoimmune encephalitis (anti-NMDA receptor; psychiatric symptoms, seizures, movement disorder)
- Metabolic leukoencephalopathy (mitochondrial disease, osmotic demyelination)

## Workup

- **MRI brain and entire spine with gadolinium** — multifocal T2/FLAIR white matter lesions, variable enhancement, thalamic/basal ganglia involvement
- **LP:** opening pressure, cell count, protein, glucose, oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cytology
  - ADEM CSF: mild pleocytosis (typically < 100 WBC, lymphocytic), mildly elevated protein, normal glucose
  - Oligoclonal bands usually absent (present in ~15% vs >90% in MS)
- **CSF infectious studies:** bacterial culture, HSV PCR, VZV PCR, enterovirus PCR, cryptococcal antigen
- **Serum studies:** MOG-IgG (cell-based assay), AQP4-IgG, CBC, BMP, ESR, CRP, LFTs
- **CT head** (initial if MRI delayed) — may show multifocal hypodensities; less sensitive than MRI
- **EEG** if seizures suspected — diffuse slowing typical; focal epileptiform activity if seizures

## Treatment

### First-Line: IV Corticosteroids
- **Methylprednisolone** 30 mg/kg/day IV (max 1 g/day) for 3-5 days
- Follow with oral prednisone taper: 1-2 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg/day), taper over 4-6 weeks
- Rapid taper risks relapse

### Second-Line: IVIG
- **IVIG** 0.4 g/kg/day IV for 5 days (total 2 g/kg) — for steroid-refractory cases
- Can be used as first-line if steroids contraindicated

### Third-Line: Plasma Exchange
- **PLEX** 5-7 exchanges — for cases refractory to steroids AND IVIG
- Requires central venous access

### Fulminant ADEM (AHLE)
- High-dose methylprednisolone + PLEX simultaneously
- Consider cyclophosphamide 500-750 mg/m2 IV for refractory cases (oncology/rheumatology consultation)
- Decompressive craniectomy for malignant cerebral edema

### Supportive Care
- Seizure management: levetiracetam 20-30 mg/kg/day IV/PO divided BID (pediatric); 500-1500 mg PO BID (adult)
- DVT prophylaxis if immobilized: enoxaparin (weight-based)
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis during steroid therapy: famotidine 20 mg IV BID
- Early rehabilitation referral

## Disposition

- **All ADEM patients:** inpatient admission
- **Encephalopathy, seizures, respiratory compromise:** PICU/ICU
- **AHLE variant:** ICU with neurosurgery standby
- **Stable, mild symptoms with improving exam:** general neurology ward
- **Discharge:** only after completing IV steroid course, neurologically stable/improving, oral taper arranged, neurology follow-up within 1-2 weeks

## Pitfalls

1. **Confusing ADEM with first-attack MS.** ADEM requires encephalopathy; MS typically does not. ADEM has large, bilateral, fluffy lesions with thalamic involvement. MS has periventricular ovoid lesions (Dawson fingers). MOG-IgG testing helps differentiate.

2. **Not excluding infection before starting steroids.** LP with CSF analysis and cultures must be obtained first. Steroids given during untreated bacterial meningitis or HSV encephalitis are harmful. Start acyclovir 10 mg/kg IV q8h empirically if HSV cannot be excluded.

3. **Tapering steroids too quickly.** A taper of < 4 weeks significantly increases relapse risk. Follow IV steroids with a 4-6 week oral prednisone taper.

4. **Missing AHLE (Hurst disease).** The hemorrhagic variant presents with hyperacute deterioration, hemorrhagic MRI lesions, and high mortality. This requires aggressive combined therapy (steroids + PLEX) and neurosurgical readiness.

5. **Failing to send MOG-IgG and AQP4-IgG.** These antibodies distinguish ADEM from NMO and MS, inform relapse risk, and guide long-term management. They must be sent on the initial presentation.
