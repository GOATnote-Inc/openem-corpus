# Laryngeal Trauma

## Recognition

**Mechanism:** Blunt (clothesline injury, MVC with steering wheel/dashboard, assault, strangulation) or penetrating (stab, GSW) trauma to anterior neck. Blunt injuries more common and more frequently missed.

**Schaefer Classification:**
- **Grade I:** Minor endolaryngeal hematoma or laceration, no fracture, no airway compromise
- **Grade II:** Edema, hematoma, minor mucosal disruption without exposed cartilage, nondisplaced fracture, variable airway compromise
- **Grade III:** Massive edema, large mucosal lacerations, exposed cartilage, displaced fracture(s), vocal cord immobility
- **Grade IV:** Same as III with disruption of anterior commissure, unstable fracture, two or more fracture lines, or massive mucosal injury
- **Grade V:** Complete laryngotracheal separation

**Presentation:**
- Hoarseness or voice change — most common symptom
- Stridor — indicates > 50% airway narrowing
- Dyspnea, air hunger
- Subcutaneous emphysema (crepitus on palpation of neck)
- Anterior neck tenderness, loss of thyroid cartilage prominence ("Adam's apple")
- Hemoptysis
- Dysphagia, odynophagia

**Key red flags for imminent airway loss:**
- Progressive stridor
- Expanding subcutaneous emphysema
- Loss of laryngeal landmarks on palpation
- Inability to vocalize

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Secure definitive airway | Immediate if any airway compromise |
| CT neck with IV contrast | After airway secured (stable patients) |
| ENT/surgery consult | < 1 hour |
| Flexible laryngoscopy | As soon as feasible (stable patients) |

1. **Airway first.** If any signs of airway compromise, secure immediately. Approach depends on severity:
   - Stable airway, mild symptoms: close monitoring, prepare for surgical airway
   - Moderate compromise: awake fiberoptic intubation (preferred) or awake tracheostomy in OR
   - Severe compromise/impending loss: emergent tracheostomy (preferred over cricothyrotomy — cricothyrotomy may worsen injury at fracture site)
   - **Do NOT attempt blind orotracheal intubation** — may convert partial obstruction to complete obstruction or create false passage
2. **Avoid positive pressure ventilation (BMV, BVM)** if laryngotracheal disruption suspected — can worsen subcutaneous emphysema and cause tension pneumomediastinum
3. **Keep patient upright** — supine positioning worsens airway compromise
4. **CT neck** with IV contrast after airway secured — delineates fractures, hematoma, cartilage displacement, and vascular injury
5. **Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy** — essential for mucosal assessment and vocal cord mobility evaluation (ENT)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Tracheal disruption (more distal injury, massive air leak)
- Esophageal perforation (cervical — neck crepitus, mediastinal air)
- Cervical spine fracture (coexisting, different mechanism of airway compromise)
- Retropharyngeal hematoma (posterior pharyngeal space — can cause airway compromise)
- Vascular injury — carotid or jugular (expanding hematoma, neurological deficit)
- Foreign body aspiration (no trauma history)
- Angioedema (no trauma mechanism, urticaria)

## Workup

- **CT neck with IV contrast** — identifies fractures, cartilage displacement, hematoma, air in soft tissues, vascular injury
- **CTA neck** — if concern for carotid/vertebral injury
- **Flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy** — direct visualization of mucosal injury, vocal cord mobility, arytenoid displacement, exposed cartilage
- **CT chest** — pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum (laryngotracheal disruption with distal air tracking)
- **Esophagography or esophagoscopy** — if esophageal injury suspected (concomitant in 5-10% of penetrating laryngeal injuries)
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, type and crossmatch, coagulation studies

## Treatment

**Grade I:**
- Observation with serial airway exams q4-6h for 24-48 hours
- HOB elevation 30-45 degrees
- Humidified air
- Voice rest
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV x 1, then 4 mg IV q6h x 48 hours (edema reduction)
- NPO initially, advance diet as tolerated

**Grade II:**
- Same as Grade I + close airway monitoring, lower threshold for tracheostomy
- Operative exploration if any question of mucosal laceration with exposed cartilage on laryngoscopy

**Grade III-V:**
- Tracheostomy (below injury site if possible)
- Operative exploration and repair within 24 hours ideally (best outcomes < 48 hours)
- Reduction and fixation of cartilage fractures
- Mucosal flap closure
- Stent placement for comminuted fractures or anterior commissure disruption
- Grade V (laryngotracheal separation): emergent surgical repair — reanastomosis

**Antibiotics (for open/penetrating injuries):**
- Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h
- Alternative: clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h

**PPI for concurrent esophageal injury:**
- Pantoprazole 40 mg IV q12h

## Disposition

- **Admit:** All laryngeal trauma — minimum 24-48 hours observation even for Grade I
- **ICU:** Grades II-V, tracheostomy, any airway concern
- **ENT/Head and Neck Surgery consult:** All cases — mandatory
- **Transfer:** To trauma center with ENT/head-and-neck surgical capability if not available
- **OR within 24 hours:** Grades III-V

## Pitfalls

1. **Attempting blind orotracheal intubation in a patient with laryngeal fracture.** This can convert a partial airway obstruction to complete obstruction, create a false passage through disrupted tissue, or worsen cartilage displacement. Preferred approach is awake tracheostomy or fiberoptic intubation.

2. **Sending an unstable airway patient to CT.** CT is valuable but only after the airway is secured. Progressive stridor, expanding crepitus, or inability to phonate require immediate airway intervention, not imaging.

3. **Dismissing hoarseness after blunt neck trauma as "minor."** Hoarseness is the most common presenting symptom of laryngeal fracture. Any voice change after neck trauma warrants CT and laryngoscopy. Initial presentation may appear mild before progressive edema causes complete obstruction.

4. **Performing cricothyrotomy instead of tracheostomy.** In laryngeal fractures, the cricothyroid membrane may be involved in the injury. Cricothyrotomy can worsen the injury. Tracheostomy (below the injury) is the preferred surgical airway.

5. **Missing concurrent esophageal injury.** Present in 5-10% of penetrating laryngeal injuries. Missed esophageal perforation leads to mediastinitis and sepsis. Perform esophagography or esophagoscopy in penetrating injuries.

6. **Using bag-valve-mask ventilation in suspected laryngotracheal disruption.** Positive pressure can force air through the disrupted airway into soft tissues, causing massive subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or tension pneumothorax.
