# Acute Porphyria

## Recognition

**Acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP):**
- Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) — most common and severe
- Variegate porphyria (VP)
- Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP)
- ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria (extremely rare)

**Classic presentation:**
- Severe, diffuse abdominal pain (>90%) — colicky, poorly localized; often triggers unnecessary surgery
- Nausea, vomiting, constipation (or diarrhea)
- Tachycardia, hypertension (sympathetic overactivity)
- Neuropsychiatric: anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, seizures
- Motor neuropathy: proximal > distal weakness; can progress to quadriparesis and respiratory failure (mimics GBS)
- Hyponatremia (SIADH — present in 25-40% of attacks)
- Dark or reddish-brown urine (may turn red/brown on standing)

**Common triggers:**
- Medications: barbiturates, sulfonamides, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, griseofulvin, ergot alkaloids, oral contraceptives (progesterone)
- Fasting/caloric restriction
- Menstrual cycle (luteal phase — progesterone)
- Alcohol
- Infection, stress, surgery
- Smoking

**Demographics:**
- Women > men (3:1); reproductive age
- Attacks rare before puberty or after menopause

## Critical Actions

1. **Stop all potentially porphyrinogenic medications** — check drug safety list (www.drugs-porphyria.org)
2. **Hemin (Panhematin) 3-4 mg/kg IV daily for 4 days** — definitive treatment; reconstitute with human albumin (NOT sterile water) to prevent phlebitis; administer through large-bore peripheral IV or central line
3. **If hemin unavailable or mild attack:** IV glucose loading — D10W at 125 mL/hr (300 g glucose/day minimum); less effective than hemin
4. **Pain management:** morphine 2-4 mg IV q3-4h or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV q3-4h — opioids are SAFE in porphyria
5. **Check serum sodium** — correct hyponatremia per standard guidelines (restrict free water if SIADH)
6. **Monitor for motor neuropathy** — serial strength testing; respiratory function (FVC); intubate if respiratory weakness

## Differential Diagnosis

- Acute abdomen requiring surgery (appendicitis, cholecystitis, bowel obstruction) — porphyria can mimic any surgical abdomen
- Lead poisoning (abdominal pain, motor neuropathy, basophilic stippling; check lead level)
- Guillain-Barre syndrome (ascending weakness, areflexia; albuminocytologic dissociation on LP)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (multisystem; ANA, anti-dsDNA)
- Hereditary angioedema (abdominal pain from bowel wall edema; C4 level)
- Conversion disorder (diagnosis of exclusion)
- Drug withdrawal (opioids, alcohol)
- Acute intermittent porphyria presenting as psychiatric emergency — commonly misdiagnosed

## Workup

- **Spot urine porphobilinogen (PBG)** — elevated > 5x ULN during attack; send STAT if available; this is the key diagnostic test
- **Spot urine aminolevulinic acid (ALA)** — elevated in all acute porphyrias
- **Urine porphyrins** (total and fractionated) — confirm and classify
- **BMP:** sodium (hyponatremia from SIADH), magnesium, renal function
- **CBC** — usually normal
- **LFTs** — may be mildly elevated
- **Serum osmolality + urine osmolality + urine sodium** — SIADH evaluation
- **ECG** — tachycardia, QT prolongation
- **CT abdomen** — to exclude surgical pathology (usually unremarkable in porphyria)
- **Genetic testing** — for confirmation (not useful acutely; send to porphyria reference lab)
- **Serial FVC** — if motor neuropathy present

## Treatment

### Specific Therapy
- **Hemin (Panhematin)** 3-4 mg/kg IV daily for 4 days (max 6 mg/kg/day)
  - Reconstitute with 25% human albumin (NOT sterile water — reduces phlebitis)
  - Administer over 15-30 min through large-bore IV or central line
  - Mechanism: downregulates ALAS1, reducing toxic porphyrin precursor production
  - Improvement typically within 24-48 hours of first dose
  - Order from pharmacy — may require overnight delivery (Lundbeck; 1-866-758-7068)

### Glucose Loading (For Mild Attacks or While Awaiting Hemin)
- **D10W IV** at 125 mL/hr (300 g glucose/day minimum)
- Less effective than hemin; use ONLY for mild attacks (pain controlled with minimal narcotics, no neurologic symptoms)
- Monitor for hyponatremia (free water load worsens SIADH)
- During hemin therapy, reduce glucose to avoid dilutional hyponatremia

### Pain Management
- **Morphine** 2-4 mg IV q3-4h PRN (SAFE in porphyria)
- **Hydromorphone** 0.5-1 mg IV q3-4h PRN (SAFE)
- **Acetaminophen** 1 g IV/PO q6h (SAFE; adjunctive)
- **Gabapentin** 300 mg PO TID — adjunctive for neuropathic component
- **AVOID:** barbiturates, ketorolac (safe but often inadequate alone)
- **SAFE anxiolytics:** lorazepam 0.5-2 mg IV q6h, chlorpromazine 12.5-25 mg IV/IM

### Nausea/Vomiting
- **Ondansetron** 4 mg IV q6h (SAFE)
- **Chlorpromazine** 12.5-25 mg IV/IM (SAFE; also provides sedation)

### Seizure Management
- **Magnesium sulfate** 4-6 g IV — first-line (safe; anticonvulsant + repletes magnesium)
- **Levetiracetam** 500-1500 mg IV BID (SAFE)
- **Gabapentin** 300-600 mg PO TID (SAFE)
- **AVOID:** phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, barbiturates — ALL are porphyrinogenic and will worsen the attack
- **Lorazepam** 4 mg IV for acute seizures (benzodiazepines are SAFE for status epilepticus)

### Hyponatremia
- Fluid restriction 800-1000 mL/day
- 3% hypertonic saline ONLY if Na < 120 with severe symptoms (seizures) — standard correction limits
- Correct Na no faster than 8 mEq/L in 24 hours

### Tachycardia/Hypertension
- Beta-blockers: propranolol 10-40 mg PO TID (SAFE; atenolol also safe)
- Avoid nifedipine and diltiazem (potentially unsafe)

## Disposition

- **All moderate-to-severe attacks:** inpatient admission with IV access for hemin
- **Respiratory compromise or motor neuropathy:** ICU with serial FVC monitoring
- **Severe hyponatremia (Na < 125):** ICU with q4h sodium monitoring
- **Mild attacks (pain only, controlled with PO analgesics):** may treat with oral carbohydrate loading and close outpatient follow-up within 24-48 hours
- **All patients:** hematology/genetics referral for long-term management

## Pitfalls

1. **Unnecessary surgery for abdominal pain.** Acute porphyria is one of the great mimics. The abdomen is soft, imaging is unrevealing, but the pain is severe. Consider porphyria in any young woman with recurrent abdominal pain, tachycardia, and negative surgical workup.

2. **Administering porphyrinogenic medications.** Phenytoin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, and many antibiotics trigger acute attacks. Check EVERY medication against the drug safety list at www.drugs-porphyria.org before administering.

3. **Missing motor neuropathy progression.** Porphyric neuropathy can progress to quadriplegia and respiratory failure within days, mimicking GBS. Serial strength testing and FVC monitoring are essential.

4. **Not checking spot urine PBG.** The diagnosis is easily made with a spot urine PBG. This test is often not ordered because porphyria is not considered. In unexplained abdominal pain with tachycardia in a young woman, send a PBG.

5. **Delaying hemin administration.** Hemin is the only specific therapy. Glucose loading is a weak substitute. If hemin is not stocked, order it immediately while starting glucose loading — overnight delivery is available.

6. **Worsening hyponatremia with glucose loading.** D10W at high rates provides a significant free water load. In patients already hyponatremic from SIADH, this can worsen sodium levels dangerously. Monitor Na q4-6h during glucose infusion.
