# Anticholinergic Toxidrome

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor blockade in peripheral and central nervous systems. Peripheral effects from blocked parasympathetic tone in target organs. Central effects from impaired CNS cholinergic neurotransmission. Severity spectrum: mild (dry, flushed, tachycardia) → moderate (agitation, confusion, urinary retention) → severe (hyperthermia, seizures, coma).

**Mnemonic — Classic Anticholinergic Toxidrome:**
- "Hot as a hare" — hyperthermia (failure of sweat-mediated heat dissipation)
- "Blind as a bat" — mydriasis, cycloplegia, blurry vision, photophobia
- "Dry as a bone" — anhidrosis (dry flushed skin), dry mucous membranes, urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds
- "Red as a beet" — vasodilation (cutaneous flushing)
- "Mad as a hatter" — agitation, confusion, delirium, hallucinations (visual > auditory)
- "Full as a flask" — urinary retention, decreased GI motility

**Common Causative Agents:**

*Prescription medications:*
- Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, promethazine) — diphenhydramine most common agent in intentional OD
- Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) — both anticholinergic AND sodium channel blocking
- Antipsychotics (quetiapine, chlorpromazine, olanzapine)
- Antiparkinson drugs (benztropine, trihexyphenidyl)
- Antispasmodics (scopolamine, hyoscine, dicyclomine, oxybutynin)
- Mydriatics (atropine eye drops, cyclopentolate)

*Over-the-counter:*
- Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) — most commonly implicated
- Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine)
- Sleep aids containing diphenhydramine (ZzzQuil, Unisom)
- Scopolamine patches

*Plants:*
- Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium) — belladonna alkaloids; common in adolescent recreational use
- Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna)
- Angel's trumpet (Brugmansia spp.)

*Recreational/intentional abuse:*
- Jimsonweed, other Datura preparations
- "Triple C" (Coricidin — contains dextromethorphan AND chlorpheniramine with anticholinergic properties)

**Distinguishing Anticholinergic from Sympathomimetic Toxidrome:**
- Both: tachycardia, mydriasis, agitation
- Anticholinergic: DRY skin, decreased bowel sounds, urinary retention, hyperthermia without diaphoresis
- Sympathomimetic: DIAPHORETIC, hyperactive bowel sounds, no urinary retention, hypertension more prominent

**Diphenhydramine-Specific Concerns:**
- QRS widening and QTc prolongation at high doses (sodium channel blockade)
- Seizures at high doses
- Rhabdomyolysis from agitation and hyperthermia

## Critical Actions

1. **Physostigmine (antidote) — 1-2 mg IV slow push over 5 minutes** for moderate-severe anticholinergic toxidrome (altered mental status, severe agitation, hyperthermia) with no contraindications. Physostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor — it increases synaptic ACh levels, overcoming the competitive receptor blockade. Onset 5-10 minutes; duration 30-60 minutes; may require repeat dosing.

   **Physostigmine Contraindications (absolute):**
   - QRS >120 ms on ECG (suggests sodium channel blockade — may indicate TCA co-ingestion; physostigmine + TCA = asystole)
   - Known or suspected TCA co-ingestion
   - Known reactive airway disease / asthma (risk of bronchospasm from cholinergic surge)
   - Mechanical bowel or bladder obstruction
   - AV block

2. **Obtain a 12-lead ECG before physostigmine.** QRS widening is the primary contraindication. A normal QRS makes TCAs unlikely and physostigmine safe.

3. **Benzodiazepines for agitation and seizures** — diazepam 5-10 mg IV (repeat q5-10 min) or lorazepam 2-4 mg IV. First-line if physostigmine contraindicated. Also use if physostigmine has been given and partial response only.

4. **Active cooling for hyperthermia** — target <39°C. Methods: evaporative cooling (mist + fan), ice packs to axillae/neck/groin, cooling blanket, cold IV fluids. Hyperthermia with anticholinergic toxidrome is exogenously driven (impaired sweating + CNS dysfunction); it is not mediated by pyrogens and will not respond to antipyretics alone. Uncontrolled hyperthermia → rhabdomyolysis, cerebral injury, death.

5. **Urinary retention** — Foley catheter. Do not assume the patient with AMS from anticholinergic toxidrome has a full bladder and is in discomfort; retention may worsen agitation.

6. **Do NOT give physostigmine for undifferentiated coma.** Physostigmine can precipitate bradycardia, seizures, and asystole in non-anticholinergic coma. It is an antidote for the specific toxidrome — not a general reversal agent.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Sympathomimetic toxidrome | Diaphoresis (NOT dry), hypertension prominent, hyperactive bowel sounds |
| Serotonin syndrome | Clonus (lower extremity > upper), hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, medication history (SSRI, MAOI) |
| Neuroleptic malignant syndrome | Rigidity (lead-pipe), gradual onset over days-weeks, antipsychotic exposure |
| Delirium tremens | Alcohol withdrawal history, diaphoresis, tremor, fever; anticholinergic features absent |
| Thyroid storm | Known thyroid disease or goiter, elevated T4/TSH; both cause tachycardia and hyperthermia |
| PCP/dissociative toxidrome | Nystagmus (vertical), bizarre behavior, hallucinations; no dry skin, no urinary retention |
| Hypertensive encephalopathy | Severe hypertension, papilledema; not a toxidrome per se |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- BMP — creatinine (renal function for medication excretion), glucose
- Creatine kinase (CK) — rhabdomyolysis from agitation, hyperthermia, or seizures
- Acetaminophen and salicylate levels (co-ingestion screen in all intentional OD)
- Urine drug screen (UDS) — diphenhydramine and other antihistamines often detectable on urine immunoassays but many agents not specifically detected; clinical toxidrome drives diagnosis
- Serum ethanol — alcohol co-ingestion common
- Temperature (rectal preferred for accuracy in obtunded patient)

**ECG (before physostigmine):**
- Normal QRS (<100 ms) — physostigmine safe
- QRS 100-120 ms — exercise caution; consider consulting toxicology
- QRS >120 ms — physostigmine CONTRAINDICATED; suspect TCA co-ingestion; sodium bicarbonate
- QTc prolongation — risk of torsades; magnesium 2g IV

**Imaging:**
- CT head if new focal deficits or trauma (altered mental status may mask injuries)
- Bladder ultrasound if urinary retention suspected (painless in obtunded patient)

## Treatment

**Physostigmine:**
- 1-2 mg IV slow push over 5 minutes (not bolus — too rapid causes cholinergic crisis)
- May repeat 1-2 mg in 5-10 minutes if initial response inadequate
- Monitor: HR (may drop), bowel sounds, pupil size, mental status improvement
- Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IV available at bedside to reverse cholinergic excess if overdosed
- Continuous cardiac monitoring during administration

**Benzodiazepines (for agitation/seizures):**
- Diazepam 5-10 mg IV q5-10 min, or lorazepam 2-4 mg IV q5-10 min
- Use generously for severe agitation to prevent hyperthermia from motor activity and rhabdomyolysis
- Propofol infusion for refractory agitation requiring intubation

**Hyperthermia:**
- Evaporative cooling: undress patient, mist with water, fan
- Ice packs: groin, axillae, neck
- Cold IV fluid (NS 1-2L cold)
- Target: temperature <39°C within 30-60 minutes
- Antipyretics (acetaminophen): ineffective as sole measure; do not delay active cooling

**Avoid:**
- Physostigmine in TCA co-ingestion (asystole risk)
- Haloperidol and phenothiazines for agitation (lower seizure threshold, worsen QTc, no cholinergic mechanism)
- Physical restraints as the only agitation management (compound hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis)

**GI Decontamination:**
- Activated charcoal 1 g/kg PO (max 50g) within 1-2 hours if patient alert and cooperative with intact airway
- Avoid in obtunded patients without protected airway (aspiration risk)

## Disposition

**ICU:**
- Hyperthermia >39°C
- Seizures
- Rhabdomyolysis (CK >1000 IU/L), acute kidney injury
- Respiratory compromise requiring airway protection
- QRS widening (>120 ms) suggesting TCA co-ingestion
- Refractory agitation requiring continuous sedation

**Floor/Observation:**
- Moderate toxidrome with partial physostigmine response
- Stable vital signs, mild-moderate agitation responsive to benzodiazepines
- Urinary retention managed with Foley
- Psychiatric evaluation pending

**Discharge:**
- Mild anticholinergic effects resolved (tachycardia resolved, clear mental status)
- 6-8 hour observation with normal ECG, normal temperature, no agitation
- Psychiatric safety assessment completed if intentional

## Pitfalls

1. **Giving physostigmine without a pre-treatment ECG.** Physostigmine combined with unrecognized TCA co-ingestion causes asystole. This is a preventable death. A 12-lead ECG is mandatory before physostigmine. QRS >120 ms = do not give physostigmine; start NaHCO3 and assume TCA.

2. **Using haloperidol or droperidol for anticholinergic agitation.** These drugs lower the seizure threshold and prolong QTc — both undesirable in anticholinergic toxidrome. Benzodiazepines are the correct sedating agent. If physostigmine is appropriate and given, agitation will resolve with the correct antidote.

3. **Treating hyperthermia with antipyretics alone.** Anticholinergic hyperthermia is not cytokine-mediated (no IL-1/IL-6 driving the hypothalamic setpoint up). It is caused by failure of sweat-mediated cooling combined with heat generated from agitation. Acetaminophen alone will not work. Active external cooling is mandatory.

4. **Assuming dry skin excludes cyanide or CO poisoning.** Both cyanide and CO cause cherry-red skin (rarely) but more commonly normal or mottled skin. The distinction relies on context: fire exposure, industrial exposure, and co-oximetry for CO; toxidrome identification for anticholinergic. Do not use skin color as the sole discriminating feature.

5. **Missing a jimsonweed/Datura ingestion in an adolescent with delirium.** Datura alkaloids cause a profound, prolonged anticholinergic syndrome with vivid visual hallucinations and extreme agitation. Adolescents may present without a clear ingestion history. The constellation of mydriasis, flushing, urinary retention, dry skin, and delirium should prompt empiric treatment for anticholinergic toxidrome regardless of stated history.

6. **Discharging too early.** Diphenhydramine and other antihistamine overdoses may have prolonged or delayed peak toxicity, especially with extended-release formulations or congested GI tract. Observe for minimum 6-8 hours; ensure normal mental status, temperature, and ECG before discharge.
