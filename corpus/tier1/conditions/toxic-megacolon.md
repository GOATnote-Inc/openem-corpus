# Toxic Megacolon

## Recognition

**Jalan Diagnostic Criteria (all required):**
1. Radiographic colonic dilation > 6 cm (typically transverse colon)
2. At least 3 of: fever > 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate > 120 bpm, WBC > 10,500/μL, anemia
3. Plus at least 1 of: dehydration, altered mental status, electrolyte abnormality, hypotension

**Presentation:**
- Acute abdominal distension and pain in patient with known IBD, C. difficile infection, or infectious colitis
- Profuse bloody diarrhea that may paradoxically decrease (cessation of diarrhea is ominous — suggests colonic atony)
- High fever, tachycardia, altered mental status
- Preceding history of colitis exacerbation, recent antibiotics, or immunosuppression

**Exam findings:**
- Diffuse abdominal tenderness with distension
- Decreased or absent bowel sounds
- Peritoneal signs indicate perforation — emergent surgery
- Tachycardia, hypotension, signs of sepsis

**Common etiologies:**
- Ulcerative colitis (most common), Crohn disease
- Clostridioides difficile infection (increasing incidence)
- CMV colitis (immunocompromised)
- Ischemic colitis, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter

## Critical Actions

1. **Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation** — isotonic crystalloid targeting MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
2. **NPO, nasogastric tube decompression**
3. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately:**
   - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h
   - Add IV metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h if C. difficile suspected
   - PO/PR vancomycin 500 mg q6h if C. difficile confirmed or suspected
4. **IV corticosteroids for IBD-related:** methylprednisolone 60 mg IV daily or hydrocortisone 100 mg IV q8h
5. **Correct electrolytes** — potassium > 4.0, magnesium > 2.0
6. **Emergent surgical consultation** — do not delay
7. **DVT prophylaxis** with subcutaneous heparin (IBD patients are hypercoagulable)
8. **Serial abdominal X-rays q12h** to monitor colonic diameter
9. **Avoid opioids, anticholinergics, antidiarrheals** — worsen colonic dilation

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Ogilvie syndrome (ACPO)** — no systemic toxicity, no mucosal disease; occurs in postoperative/immobile patients
- **Mechanical large bowel obstruction** — transition point on CT, no mucosal inflammation
- **Fulminant C. difficile colitis without megacolon** — watery diarrhea, WBC often > 30,000
- **Ischemic colitis** — watershed distribution, elderly/vascular disease, lactate elevation
- **Cecal volvulus** — focal cecal dilation, coffee-bean sign

## Workup

- **Abdominal X-ray:** colonic dilation > 6 cm (transverse colon), loss of haustral markings, thumbprinting (mucosal edema)
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** wall thickening, pericolic stranding, assess for perforation (free air), pneumatosis intestinalis (indicates transmural ischemia)
- **Labs:** CBC (leukocytosis or leukemoid reaction), BMP, lactate, CRP, ESR, blood cultures, C. difficile toxin assay (PCR), stool studies
- **Type and screen** — anticipate need for transfusion or surgery
- **Avoid colonoscopy** — high perforation risk in toxic megacolon
- **Avoid barium enema** — risk of perforation and barium peritonitis

## Treatment

**Medical management (48-72 hour window before mandatory surgical reassessment):**
- IV corticosteroids (IBD): methylprednisolone 60 mg IV daily
- IV antibiotics as above
- Bowel rest, NG decompression
- Rectal tube for decompression
- Rolling patient prone/knee-chest q2-4h to facilitate gas redistribution
- Correct anemia: transfuse for Hgb < 7 g/dL or active hemorrhage
- TPN if prolonged NPO anticipated

**C. difficile-specific:**
- Vancomycin 500 mg PO/NG q6h PLUS metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
- Consider vancomycin retention enema 500 mg in 100 mL NS q6h if ileus prevents oral delivery
- Fidaxomicin 200 mg PO BID as alternative to oral vancomycin

**Rescue therapy for steroid-refractory IBD (no improvement at 72h):**
- Infliximab 5 mg/kg IV (single dose; contraindicated if perforation suspected)
- Cyclosporine 2-4 mg/kg/day IV continuous infusion (alternative)

**Surgical indications (emergent):**
- Perforation (free air)
- Peritonitis
- Massive hemorrhage unresponsive to resuscitation
- Clinical deterioration despite 48-72h maximal medical therapy
- Progressive colonic dilation despite treatment
- Procedure: subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy (Hartmann procedure)

## Disposition

- **ICU admission** for all patients meeting toxic megacolon criteria
- **Continuous telemetry, arterial line** for hemodynamically unstable patients
- **Surgical team co-management** from admission
- **Serial exam and imaging q12h** — deterioration mandates surgery
- **Never discharge** — inpatient management until resolution confirmed

## Pitfalls

1. **Administering antidiarrheal agents (loperamide, diphenoxylate-atropine) in acute colitis.** These decrease colonic motility and directly precipitate or worsen toxic megacolon.

2. **Delaying surgical consultation.** Mortality doubles when surgery is performed after perforation vs before. Surgical team must be engaged from time of diagnosis, not as a rescue.

3. **Using colonoscopy for diagnosis.** Colonoscopy in toxic megacolon carries unacceptable perforation risk. Diagnosis is clinical + radiographic (Jalan criteria). CT is the preferred imaging modality.

4. **Cessation of diarrhea interpreted as improvement.** In active colitis, sudden cessation of diarrhea with increasing abdominal distension signals colonic atony and worsening — not clinical improvement.

5. **Missing C. difficile as the etiology in IBD patients.** C. difficile superinfection triggers toxic megacolon in 5-10% of IBD flares. Always test. Treatment requires vancomycin + metronidazole IN ADDITION to steroids.

6. **Failure to hold steroids appropriately in C. difficile-only toxic megacolon.** Steroids are for IBD-mediated disease. In pure C. difficile toxic megacolon without underlying IBD, steroids may worsen infection.
