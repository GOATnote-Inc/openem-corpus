# Hyphema

## Recognition

**Definition:** blood in the anterior chamber of the eye, visible as layered blood inferiorly or diffuse blood obscuring the iris

**Grading:**
- Grade I: < 1/3 of anterior chamber filled
- Grade II: 1/3 to 1/2 filled
- Grade III: > 1/2 filled
- Grade IV (8-ball hyphema): total anterior chamber filled with dark blood

**Microhyphema:** circulating RBCs visible only on slit lamp (no visible layering)

**Common causes:**
- Blunt trauma (most common — fist, ball, airbag, fall)
- Penetrating trauma (rule out open globe)
- Spontaneous (sickle cell disease, iris neovascularization from diabetes/CRVO, blood thinners, intraocular tumors)
- Post-operative (cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery)

**Key concern: rebleed**
- Occurs in 4-35% of cases, typically days 2-5 after injury
- Rebleed is larger than initial hyphema and has worse prognosis
- Sickle cell trait/disease dramatically increases complications (sickling of RBCs in anterior chamber → outflow obstruction → severe IOP elevation)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Rule out open globe | Immediately |
| Visual acuity | At presentation |
| IOP measurement | At presentation (unless open globe) |
| Sickle cell screen | All Black patients and those of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern descent |
| Ophthalmology consultation | Same day |

1. **Rule out open globe** — if suspected, place eye shield (NOT pressure patch), do NOT measure IOP, do NOT instill drops, emergent ophthalmology consultation
2. **Visual acuity** — document baseline
3. **Slit lamp exam** — grade hyphema, examine for lens subluxation, iridodialysis, vitreous hemorrhage
4. **IOP measurement** (Tono-Pen or Goldmann) — elevated IOP requires treatment
5. **Sickle cell screen** (Sickledex) in all at-risk patients — changes management significantly
6. **CT orbits** if suspicion for orbital fracture or intraocular foreign body
7. **Shield the eye** (Fox shield) — protect from further trauma; do NOT patch

## Differential Diagnosis

- Open globe injury (full-thickness wound, irregular pupil, low IOP, positive Seidel test)
- Iris neovascularization bleeding (diabetes, CRVO — spontaneous hyphema without trauma)
- Anterior uveitis with fibrinous reaction (can layer similarly; no blood)
- Vitreous hemorrhage (blood behind lens, not in anterior chamber)
- Intraocular tumor (melanoma, retinoblastoma — spontaneous hyphema)
- Lens subluxation/dislocation (iridodonesis, phacodonesis, visible lens edge)
- Child abuse (hyphema in infant/toddler without clear mechanism)

## Workup

- **Visual acuity:** Snellen or finger counting
- **Slit lamp exam:** grade hyphema, assess corneal clarity, anterior chamber depth, lens position, pupil shape
- **IOP measurement:** elevated in 30% (trabecular meshwork obstruction by blood); dangerous in sickle cell
- **Gonioscopy:** deferred to ophthalmology follow-up (assess angle recession)
- **Dilated fundoscopy:** assess for vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, commotio retinae (do NOT dilate if open globe suspected)
- **CT orbits (non-contrast):** if orbital fracture or foreign body suspected
- **B-scan ultrasound:** if posterior segment not visualizable (vitreous hemorrhage)
- **Sickle cell screen (Sickledex):** all at-risk patients; sickle cell trait is sufficient to cause complications
- **PT/INR, CBC:** if on anticoagulants or bleeding disorder suspected

## Treatment

### Medical Management (All Grades)
- **Bed rest with head of bed elevated 30-45 degrees** — allows blood to layer inferiorly and away from visual axis
- **Fox shield** over affected eye (hard shield, not patch) — prevents further trauma
- **Cycloplegic:** atropine 1% 1 drop to affected eye BID — reduces pain (ciliary spasm), prevents posterior synechiae, stabilizes blood-aqueous barrier
- **Topical prednisolone acetate 1%** 1 drop QID — reduces inflammation and rebleed risk
- **Avoid aspirin, NSAIDs, anticoagulants** — increase rebleed risk
- **Pain control:** acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h (NO ibuprofen/aspirin)
- **Antiemetics:** ondansetron 4 mg PO/IV PRN (prevent Valsalva from vomiting)
- **Aminocaproic acid 50 mg/kg PO q4h (max 30 g/day) x 5 days** — antifibrinolytic to reduce rebleed risk (controversial; used more for Grade II-IV)

### IOP Management
- **Timolol 0.5% 1 drop BID** — first-line for elevated IOP
- **Brimonidine 0.2% 1 drop TID** (avoid in children < 2 years — CNS depression)
- **Acetazolamide 500 mg PO BID** — if topical agents insufficient. CONTRAINDICATED in sickle cell (acidosis promotes sickling)
- **Mannitol 1-2 g/kg IV over 45 minutes** — for acutely elevated IOP (> 40 mmHg) unresponsive to topical agents

### Sickle Cell Patients (Trait or Disease)
- **Lower threshold for treatment** — IOP > 24 mmHg requires intervention (vs > 30 in non-sickle)
- **Avoid:** acetazolamide (causes acidosis → sickling), epinephrine/phenylephrine (vasoconstriction), methazolamide
- **Use:** timolol, brimonidine, mannitol for IOP control
- **Lower surgical threshold** — earlier anterior chamber washout if IOP remains elevated

### Surgical (Anterior Chamber Washout)
- Indications: IOP > 50 mmHg for > 5 days, IOP > 35 mmHg for > 7 days, Grade IV (8-ball) hyphema not resolving, corneal blood staining, sickle cell with IOP > 24 for > 24 hours
- Performed by ophthalmology in OR

## Disposition

- **Grade I, normal IOP, no sickle cell:** Discharge with strict activity restriction, head elevation, eye shield; ophthalmology follow-up in 24 hours
- **Grade II-IV:** Admission strongly recommended (rebleed monitoring, IOP management); at minimum, daily ophthalmology follow-up
- **Sickle cell (trait or disease):** Low threshold for admission regardless of grade (complications develop rapidly)
- **Children:** Admission recommended (compliance with activity restriction unreliable)
- **All patients:** avoid contact sports for 4-6 weeks; no aspirin/NSAIDs

## Pitfalls

1. **Not screening for sickle cell trait/disease.** Even sickle cell TRAIT (not just disease) causes sickling of RBCs in the anterior chamber, leading to severe IOP elevation and optic nerve damage. Acetazolamide, commonly used for IOP, is contraindicated in sickle cell patients because it promotes acidosis and further sickling.

2. **Prescribing NSAIDs for pain.** Aspirin, ibuprofen, and other NSAIDs impair platelet function and increase the risk of rebleed. Use acetaminophen only.

3. **Missing an open globe.** Blunt trauma causing hyphema can also cause globe rupture. If the pupil is irregular, IOP is very low, or the mechanism is penetrating, treat as open globe. Do NOT measure IOP or instill drops until globe rupture is excluded.

4. **Discharging Grade III-IV hyphema without ophthalmology consultation.** Large hyphemas have the highest rebleed rate, risk of corneal blood staining, and glaucoma. These patients need ophthalmology involvement from the ED.

5. **Failure to consider child abuse.** An infant or toddler with hyphema and no clear mechanism of trauma should be evaluated for non-accidental trauma. Obtain a full skeletal survey and retinal exam.
