# Bronchiolitis

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute viral lower respiratory tract infection causing inflammation, edema, and necrosis of small airway epithelium with increased mucus production and bronchospasm. Number one cause of hospitalization in infants less than 12 months. Applies to children aged 1-23 months (AAP 2014 guideline scope).

**Etiology:**
- RSV: most common cause (50-80% of cases), peak season November-March in northern hemisphere
- Human metapneumovirus (hMPV): second most common
- Rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3, influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus
- Co-infection with multiple viruses occurs in 10-30% of hospitalized infants

**Epidemiology:**
- Peak age of severity: 2-6 months
- 90% of children infected with RSV by age 2 years
- ~100,000 hospitalizations per year in the US (children < 2 years)
- Mortality low in developed countries (< 1% of hospitalized infants), but significant in premature or chronically ill infants
- Seasonal pattern: late fall through early spring (northern hemisphere)

**Risk Factors for Severe Disease:**
- Age < 12 weeks (especially < 6 weeks)
- Prematurity (< 37 weeks gestational age, especially < 32 weeks)
- Hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease
- Chronic lung disease of prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia)
- Immunodeficiency (congenital or acquired)
- Neuromuscular disorders impairing cough clearance
- Down syndrome (smaller airways, immune differences)
- Exposure to tobacco smoke, crowded household, daycare attendance

**Presentation:**
- 2-4 day prodrome of rhinorrhea, cough, low-grade fever
- Progresses to tachypnea, wheezing, crackles, increased work of breathing
- Subcostal and intercostal retractions, nasal flaring, accessory muscle use
- Feeding difficulty (cannot coordinate suck-swallow-breathe)
- Irritability alternating with lethargy in severe cases
- Hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90-92%) in moderate-severe disease
- Fever typically low-grade (38-39 degrees C); high fever (> 39.5 degrees C) should prompt evaluation for secondary bacterial infection

**Apnea Risk:**
- Infants < 2 months, especially former premature infants (< 37 weeks GA)
- Apnea may be the presenting sign BEFORE other respiratory symptoms develop
- Central apnea mechanism (not obstructive)
- Risk highest in first 48-72 hours of illness

## Critical Actions

1. **Clinical diagnosis only.** Bronchiolitis is diagnosed by history and physical examination. Routine viral testing does NOT change management (AAP 2014). Do not order RSV panels, respiratory viral panels, chest X-rays, or blood work for straightforward presentations.
2. **Assess oxygenation.** Continuous pulse oximetry for infants with moderate-severe distress. Supplemental oxygen if SpO2 persistently < 90% (AAP 2014; some institutions use 92% threshold).
3. **Nasal suctioning.** Superficial bulb or mechanical suctioning of the nares to clear secretions. This is the single most effective intervention for symptom relief. Deep suctioning is not superior and may cause mucosal edema.
4. **Assess hydration status.** Infants with increased work of breathing cannot maintain oral intake. Start NG or IV fluids if oral intake is less than 50% of normal or signs of dehydration are present. D5-NS or D5-1/2NS at maintenance rate.
5. **Do NOT administer bronchodilators, corticosteroids, or antibiotics.** AAP 2014 guideline explicitly recommends against albuterol, epinephrine, systemic corticosteroids, and antibiotics for bronchiolitis. These do not improve outcomes and expose infants to unnecessary adverse effects.
6. **Identify high-risk infants requiring close monitoring:** age < 2 months, former premature infants, congenital heart disease, immunodeficiency, chronic lung disease. These patients have higher risk of apnea, respiratory failure, and ICU admission.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Asthma / reactive airway disease | Age typically > 2 years, recurrent episodes, personal or family history of atopy, response to bronchodilators. First wheezing episode in an infant during RSV season is bronchiolitis, not asthma. |
| Bacterial pneumonia | High fever (> 39.5 degrees C), focal crackles/decreased breath sounds, toxic appearance, lobar consolidation on CXR, elevated WBC/procalcitonin. Consider if no improvement or worsening after 48-72 hours. |
| Pertussis | Paroxysmal staccato cough with inspiratory whoop, post-tussive emesis, apnea in young infants, no wheezing. Incomplete immunization history. Confirm with PCR nasopharyngeal swab. |
| Foreign body aspiration | Sudden onset in well child without URI prodrome, unilateral wheezing, history of choking episode, age typically 6 months to 3 years. CXR may show hyperinflation or atelectasis. |
| Congestive heart failure | Hepatomegaly, gallop rhythm, cardiomegaly on CXR, poor weight gain, feeding difficulty predating URI symptoms, failure to thrive. Echocardiography diagnostic. |
| Croup | Barking cough, inspiratory stridor (upper airway), hoarseness, no wheezing. Peak age 1-2 years. Responds to dexamethasone and nebulized epinephrine. |
| Myocarditis | Tachycardia out of proportion to fever, gallop, poor perfusion, elevated troponin, cardiomegaly, new murmur. Can mimic bronchiolitis early. |
| Vascular ring / airway anomaly | Chronic stridor or wheezing since birth, failure to improve with standard treatment, biphasic stridor, feeding difficulty. CT angiography or bronchoscopy for diagnosis. |

## Workup

**Bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis. Routine testing is not indicated for typical presentations (AAP 2014).**

**Pulse Oximetry:**
- Continuous monitoring if admitted or in moderate-severe distress
- Intermittent spot-checks acceptable for mild cases during ED observation
- SpO2 < 90% persistent: initiate supplemental oxygen
- Brief self-resolving desaturations during sleep are common and do not require intervention if baseline SpO2 is adequate

**Tests that are NOT routinely recommended (AAP 2014):**
- Viral testing (RSV rapid antigen, respiratory viral panel): does not change management. May be useful for cohorting inpatients during RSV season.
- Chest X-ray: low yield in typical bronchiolitis. Findings (hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening, atelectasis) often lead to inappropriate antibiotic use. Obtain only if diagnosis is uncertain, clinical deterioration suggests complication (pneumonia, air leak), or ICU-level disease.
- CBC, CRP, blood culture: not indicated unless concern for secondary bacterial infection (persistent high fever, toxic appearance, focal consolidation).
- Blood gas: reserve for impending respiratory failure or patients being considered for mechanical ventilation.

**When to obtain testing:**
- CXR: atypical course, failure to improve by day 5-7, concern for bacterial pneumonia or air leak, ICU admission
- CBC/blood culture: toxic appearance, persistent high fever (> 39.5 degrees C for > 48-72 hours), concern for secondary bacterial infection
- UA/urine culture: febrile infant < 2 months (UTI evaluation per febrile infant protocols)
- Blood gas: severe respiratory distress, consideration of HFNC/CPAP/intubation

## Treatment

**Supportive care is the cornerstone. There is no specific antiviral therapy for bronchiolitis.**

**Nasal Suctioning:**
- Bulb suction or low-pressure mechanical suction of the nares before feeds and as needed
- Superficial suctioning is adequate; deep nasopharyngeal suctioning does not improve outcomes and causes mucosal trauma
- Normal saline drops (1-2 drops per nare) before suctioning to loosen secretions

**Oxygen Supplementation:**
- Low-flow nasal cannula: start at 0.5-2 L/min for SpO2 < 90%
- Titrate to maintain SpO2 ≥ 90% (AAP 2014 threshold; some institutions target ≥ 92%)
- Wean oxygen as tolerated; brief desaturations during sleep do not require escalation

**High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC):**
- 2 L/kg/min of heated humidified oxygen (typical starting flow)
- For moderate-severe distress with persistent hypoxemia or increased work of breathing despite standard O2
- Franklin et al. (NEJM 2018): HFNC reduced escalation of care compared to standard O2 therapy (12% vs 23% treatment failure)
- Does not require ICU at all centers; some EDs and general wards use HFNC with appropriate monitoring

**Nasal CPAP / Mechanical Ventilation:**
- CPAP 5-8 cm H2O for infants failing HFNC (persistent hypoxemia, severe retractions, apnea)
- Intubation for respiratory failure: apnea unresponsive to CPAP, severe hypoxemia (SpO2 < 85% on maximal non-invasive support), altered mental status, cardiovascular instability
- ETT size: age/4 + 4 (uncuffed) or age/4 + 3.5 (cuffed) for infants, typically 3.0-3.5 mm for neonates

**Hydration:**
- Oral feeds if tolerating (small frequent feeds; thickened feeds not recommended)
- NG tube feeds if unable to coordinate feeding with respiratory effort but not in severe distress
- IV fluids if NPO or NG not feasible: D5-NS or D5-1/2NS at maintenance rate (Holliday-Segar)
- Monitor for SIADH (hyponatremia) in hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis

**Nebulized Hypertonic Saline (3%):**
- 4 mL nebulized every 4-8 hours for inpatients
- Cochrane review (Zhang et al. 2017): modest reduction in length of stay for admitted patients (MD -0.41 days)
- AAP 2014: may be administered to hospitalized infants; evidence does not support use in the ED for discharge
- Administer with continuous monitoring (theoretical risk of bronchospasm; rarely clinically significant)

**Interventions NOT Recommended (AAP 2014 — strong evidence against):**

| Intervention | AAP Recommendation | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Albuterol / salbutamol | Do not administer | No improvement in outcomes; does not reduce hospitalization or LOS. Peripheral beta-agonist receptors are immature in infants. |
| Nebulized epinephrine | Do not administer | No sustained benefit; brief improvement does not translate to meaningful outcomes. |
| Systemic corticosteroids | Do not administer | No benefit in bronchiolitis (unlike croup/asthma). Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses confirm no effect on admission, LOS, or clinical scores. |
| Antibiotics | Do not administer | Bronchiolitis is viral. Concurrent serious bacterial infection rate is low (1-2% for UTI; bacteremia extremely rare). Treat only documented bacterial co-infection. |
| Chest physiotherapy | Do not use routinely | No benefit in acute bronchiolitis; may increase distress. |

**Palivizumab Prophylaxis (prevention, not acute treatment):**
- Monoclonal antibody against RSV F protein
- 15 mg/kg IM monthly during RSV season
- AAP indications: premature infants < 29 weeks GA in first year of life, hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease in first 2 years, chronic lung disease of prematurity requiring medical treatment in prior 6 months
- Nirsevimab (long-acting monoclonal antibody): single dose, approved for all infants entering first RSV season and children < 2 years at high risk entering second RSV season

## Disposition

**Discharge from ED:**
- Mild disease: SpO2 > 90% on room air, adequate oral intake (> 50% of normal), no significant respiratory distress at rest, reliable caregivers, good follow-up within 24-48 hours
- Peak severity typically occurs at day 3-5 of illness. If presenting on day 1-2 with mild symptoms, explicit return precautions are critical.
- Return precautions: worsening breathing difficulty, nasal flaring/retractions, refusal to feed, decreased wet diapers (< 3 in 24 hours), apnea, cyanosis, lethargy

**Admission Criteria (AAP 2014 guideline-informed):**
- Persistent SpO2 < 90% despite suctioning and brief observation
- Moderate-severe respiratory distress (persistent tachypnea, retractions, grunting)
- Inability to maintain adequate oral hydration
- History of apnea or witnessed apnea in the ED
- Age < 2 months (high apnea risk)
- Age < 1 month (very high risk; low threshold for admission)
- Former premature infant < 48 weeks postconceptional age
- Underlying high-risk condition (congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease, immunodeficiency)
- Toxic appearance or concern for secondary bacterial infection
- Unreliable follow-up or caregiver concern about ability to monitor at home

**ICU Admission:**
- Apnea requiring intervention (stimulation, CPAP, intubation)
- Respiratory failure: need for CPAP, HFNC (at institutions where HFNC requires ICU), or mechanical ventilation
- SpO2 < 85% on supplemental O2
- Severe respiratory distress unresponsive to supportive care
- Cardiovascular instability (poor perfusion, hypotension)
- Altered mental status

**Expected Course:**
- Symptoms peak day 3-5, then gradually improve over 1-2 weeks
- Cough may persist 2-4 weeks
- Median LOS for admitted patients: 2-3 days
- Post-bronchiolitis wheezing recurrence is common (40-50% in first year); does not equal asthma diagnosis

## Pitfalls

1. **Ordering unnecessary viral testing.** RSV or respiratory viral panel results do not change management for individual patients. Positive tests lead to parental anxiety and do not guide therapy. Negative tests do not exclude bronchiolitis (clinical diagnosis). Viral testing is only useful for cohorting inpatients during RSV season, not for ED decision-making.

2. **Obtaining a chest X-ray in uncomplicated bronchiolitis.** CXR findings in bronchiolitis (atelectasis, peribronchial cuffing, hyperinflation) are frequently misinterpreted as bacterial pneumonia, leading to inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in up to 25-30% of cases where CXR is obtained. Reserve imaging for atypical presentations, clinical deterioration, or ICU-level disease.

3. **Administering albuterol or corticosteroids.** Despite strong AAP recommendations against their use, bronchodilators and systemic steroids remain widely prescribed for bronchiolitis. Neither agent has demonstrated benefit in RCTs. A "trial of albuterol" is particularly misleading: any apparent improvement is likely from nasal suctioning performed concurrently, spontaneous fluctuation, or placebo effect. Ordering these medications delays recognition that supportive care is the only effective treatment.

4. **Prescribing antibiotics without evidence of bacterial co-infection.** Concurrent serious bacterial infection in bronchiolitis is rare (UTI ~1-2% in febrile infants; bacteremia < 1%). Antibiotics are not indicated unless a specific bacterial infection is documented (positive urine culture, lobar consolidation with high fever, toxic appearance). The viral illness itself causes fever and elevated inflammatory markers, which should not be misinterpreted as bacterial infection.

5. **Missing apnea risk in young infants.** Infants < 2 months (especially former premature infants) can present with apnea as the FIRST manifestation of RSV bronchiolitis, before wheezing or respiratory distress develops. Apnea is central (not obstructive), unpredictable, and potentially fatal. These infants require continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and admission even if initial respiratory examination appears benign.

6. **Discharging too early in the disease course.** Bronchiolitis symptoms peak on day 3-5. An infant presenting on day 1-2 with mild symptoms may deteriorate significantly over the next 24-48 hours. Provide explicit anticipatory guidance about expected worsening, clear return precautions, and ensure follow-up within 24-48 hours. Caregiver understanding must be confirmed before discharge.

7. **Aggressive deep nasopharyngeal suctioning.** Deep suctioning beyond the nares causes mucosal edema, bleeding, and increased secretion production. It does not improve outcomes compared to superficial nasal suctioning and may worsen obstruction. Gentle superficial bulb or low-pressure mechanical suctioning is sufficient.

8. **Over-reliance on continuous pulse oximetry for disposition.** Continuous pulse oximetry in mild bronchiolitis detects frequent, brief, self-resolving desaturations (especially during sleep) that are clinically insignificant. These episodes trigger alarms, prolong ED stays, and lead to unnecessary admissions. Use intermittent spot-checks for mild disease. Persistent desaturations below 90% on repeated checks drive the oxygen decision, not transient dips.

9. **Failing to consider alternative diagnoses in atypical presentations.** An infant with wheezing who does not have a viral prodrome, does not improve by day 5-7, has unilateral findings, has recurrent episodes, or has disproportionate tachycardia may not have bronchiolitis. Foreign body aspiration, congenital heart disease, vascular ring, and myocarditis must remain on the differential. A diagnostic label of "bronchiolitis" should not prevent reassessment when the clinical trajectory does not fit.
