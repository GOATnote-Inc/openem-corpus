# Central Cord Syndrome

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Upper extremity weakness disproportionately greater than lower extremity weakness
- "Cape-like" sensory deficit: variable pain/temperature loss in upper extremities and upper trunk
- Bladder dysfunction (urinary retention common)
- Most common incomplete spinal cord injury pattern (~70% of incomplete SCI)

**Typical mechanism:**
- Hyperextension injury in elderly patients with pre-existing cervical spondylosis/stenosis
- Fall or motor vehicle collision with neck hyperextension
- Can occur WITHOUT fracture or dislocation (ligamentous/degenerative stenosis)
- Younger patients: higher-energy trauma with fracture-dislocation

**Key exam findings:**
- Motor: weakness in hands/arms > legs; grip strength severely impaired
- Sensory: variable; spinothalamic (pain/temperature) loss more prominent than posterior column (proprioception/vibration)
- Reflexes: may show upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, Babinski) below level of injury; may be areflexic acutely (spinal shock)
- Sacral sparing (perianal sensation, rectal tone, toe flexion) indicates incomplete injury — prognosis better

## Critical Actions

1. **Maintain cervical spine immobilization** with rigid collar until imaging complete
2. **MRI cervical spine** — modality of choice; demonstrates cord signal change, stenosis, disc herniation, ligamentous injury
3. **Maintain MAP >= 75-80 mmHg** for minimum 5-7 days (2024 AANS guideline update; previously 85 mmHg); use vasopressors if needed (norepinephrine 0.05-0.3 mcg/kg/min IV preferred)
4. **Urgent neurosurgery consultation** — early decompression within 24 hours improves neurologic outcomes
5. **Foley catheter** for urinary retention monitoring
6. **DVT prophylaxis** within 72 hours: enoxaparin 30 mg SQ q12h (or 40 mg SQ daily)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Anterior cord syndrome (motor and spinothalamic loss; posterior columns preserved)
- Brown-Sequard syndrome (ipsilateral motor + posterior column loss, contralateral spinothalamic loss)
- Complete spinal cord injury (no motor/sensory function below level)
- Bilateral brachial plexus injury (upper extremity weakness without myelopathic signs)
- Cervical disc herniation with myelopathy (subacute, progressive)
- Transverse myelitis (inflammatory; fever, bilateral symptoms, MRI inflammatory pattern)
- Epidural abscess or hematoma (back pain, fever, progressive neurologic deficit)

## Workup

- **CT cervical spine** — initial imaging in trauma; identifies fractures, dislocations
- **MRI cervical spine** — essential; T2 hyperintensity within central cord, degree of canal stenosis, disc herniation, ligamentous injury
- **CT angiography of neck** if vascular injury suspected
- **AP/lateral cervical X-rays** — limited utility; CT preferred
- **CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, type and screen**
- **Urinalysis, bladder scan** — assess for retention
- **ASIA (American Spinal Injury Association) exam** — standardized neurologic assessment; document motor level, sensory level, ASIA Impairment Scale

## Treatment

### Hemodynamic Management
- MAP goal >= 75-80 mmHg for 5-7 days (2024 guideline)
- Norepinephrine 0.05-0.3 mcg/kg/min IV first-line vasopressor
- Arterial line for continuous monitoring
- Avoid hypotension: neurogenic shock common in cervical SCI (bradycardia + hypotension); treat with IV fluids and vasopressors

### Surgical Management
- Early decompression (< 24 hours) recommended for central cord syndrome with ongoing compression
- Posterior laminectomy or anterior corpectomy depending on pathology
- Emergent surgery if progressive neurologic deterioration

### Steroid Controversy
- High-dose methylprednisolone NOT recommended as standard of care (NASCIS III data not supported by subsequent evidence)
- If used (individual case basis): methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV bolus, then 5.4 mg/kg/hr for 23 hours — only if initiated within 8 hours of injury
- Most centers have abandoned routine steroid use

### Supportive Care
- DVT prophylaxis: enoxaparin 30 mg SQ q12h starting within 72 hours
- Stress ulcer prophylaxis: pantoprazole 40 mg IV daily
- Temperature regulation (poikilothermia in cervical SCI)
- Bowel regimen: docusate 100 mg PO BID + bisacodyl 10 mg PR PRN
- Pain management: gabapentin 300 mg PO TID, titrate for neuropathic pain; avoid opioids if possible

## Disposition

- **All patients:** ICU admission for hemodynamic monitoring and MAP goals
- **Surgical candidates:** neurosurgery consultation, OR within 24 hours if indicated
- **Stable, mild deficits without ongoing compression:** may be monitored on step-down with serial exams
- **Transfer criteria:** any facility without MRI capability, neurosurgery, or ICU should transfer immediately

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing central cord syndrome in elderly fall patients.** A fall with new upper extremity weakness in an elderly patient with known cervical spondylosis is central cord syndrome until proven otherwise. CT may show no fracture — MRI is required.

2. **Failing to obtain MRI.** CT identifies fractures but cannot visualize cord injury, edema, or soft tissue compression. MRI is the definitive study for central cord syndrome.

3. **Allowing hypotension.** Neurogenic shock (bradycardia + hypotension) worsens secondary spinal cord injury. Maintain MAP >= 75-80 mmHg aggressively with fluids and vasopressors.

4. **Delaying neurosurgical consultation.** Early decompression within 24 hours is associated with improved neurologic recovery. Late consultation delays definitive treatment.

5. **Attributing upper extremity weakness to shoulder/orthopedic injury.** In the setting of a fall, clinicians may focus on musculoskeletal complaints and miss myelopathic signs. A full neurologic exam including rectal tone is essential.
