# Needle Decompression

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Clinical diagnosis of tension pneumothorax with hemodynamic instability:
  - Hypotension, tachycardia
  - Absent breath sounds on one side
  - Tracheal deviation away from affected side (late sign)
  - Distended neck veins (may be absent in hypovolemia)
  - Subcutaneous emphysema
  - Difficulty ventilating (high peak pressures in intubated patients)
  - PEA arrest with unilateral absent breath sounds
- Traumatic cardiac arrest protocol (bilateral decompression before thoracotomy)
- Suspected tension pneumothorax in intubated patient with acute desaturation and hypotension

**Clinical Diagnosis is Sufficient:** Do NOT delay decompression for imaging. Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis treated on suspicion. CXR takes too long and may appear normal in supine patients.

**Contraindications:**
- None absolute in suspected tension pneumothorax with hemodynamic compromise
- Relative: simple pneumothorax without tension physiology (manage with tube thoracostomy without needle decompression)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Clinical recognition | Immediate |
| Needle insertion | < 30 seconds from decision |
| Improvement (BP rise, SpO2 rise) | Within 30-60 seconds of decompression |
| Tube thoracostomy follow-up | As soon as possible after stabilization |

1. **Identify the affected side** — absent breath sounds, hyperresonance, in arrest decompress bilaterally
2. **Select insertion site** — 5th ICS anterior axillary line (preferred) or 2nd ICS midclavicular line
3. **Insert large-bore angiocatheter** over the superior rib border into the pleural space
4. **Confirm decompression** — hiss of air, hemodynamic improvement
5. **Convert to tube thoracostomy** — needle decompression is a bridge only

## Differential Diagnosis

**Other Causes of Acute Respiratory and Hemodynamic Deterioration:**

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Simple pneumothorax | No hemodynamic compromise; absent breath sounds but stable vital signs; manage with tube thoracostomy |
| Massive hemothorax | Dullness to percussion (not hyperresonance); trachea may shift; needs tube thoracostomy and blood replacement |
| Cardiac tamponade | Muffled heart sounds; bilateral breath sounds present; JVD; bedside echo diagnostic |
| Right mainstem intubation | Absent left breath sounds; pull back ETT; confirm bilateral breath sounds |
| Mucus plug/bronchospasm | Absent breath sounds segmental; high peak pressures; suction/bronchodilator |
| Auto-PEEP (breath stacking) | Bilateral diminished breath sounds; disconnect ventilator to decompress |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- Clinical diagnosis: no imaging required before decompression in unstable patients
- Ultrasound (if immediately available, < 30 seconds): absent lung sliding, absent B-lines, and barcode sign on M-mode confirm pneumothorax; presence of lung point localizes the boundary

**Equipment:**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Angiocatheter | 14g, length >= 8 cm (3.25 inches); some recommend 10 cm (4 inches) for obese patients |
| Alternative | Commercial devices (ARS needle, 10 Fr chest decompression needle) designed for deeper chest walls |
| Antiseptic | Chlorhexidine or alcohol swab (do not delay for formal prep) |
| Finger thoracostomy | Scalpel and finger as alternative decompression method (preferred by some trauma protocols) |

**Site Selection:**

| Site | Landmark | Advantage | Limitation |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 5th ICS, anterior axillary line (preferred) | Nipple level, anterior to mid-axillary fold | Thinner chest wall; higher success rate (88% vs 58%); avoids mediastinal structures | Requires arm abduction; more lateral |
| 2nd ICS, midclavicular line (traditional) | Below clavicle, midpoint between sternum and shoulder | Easy to identify; traditional teaching | Chest wall thickness > 4.5 cm in 30% of adults; higher failure rate; risk of subclavian injury if too medial |

## Treatment

### Standard Technique

**Step 1: Identify Site**
- **Preferred:** 5th ICS, anterior axillary line on the affected side
- **Alternative:** 2nd ICS, midclavicular line (palpate clavicle, find midpoint, drop two rib spaces)
- In arrest: decompress bilaterally at either site

**Step 2: Prep**
- Quick chlorhexidine or alcohol swab (do not delay for formal sterile prep in arrest)
- No local anesthesia in arrest; in conscious patients, lidocaine 1% 2-3 mL locally if time permits

**Step 3: Insert Needle**
- Hold 14g angiocatheter (>= 8 cm) perpendicular to chest wall (90 degrees)
- Insert directly over the superior border of the rib below (avoids intercostal neurovascular bundle on the inferior rib border)
- Advance steadily — a "pop" or rush of air confirms pleural entry
- In the 2nd ICS: insert over the 3rd rib
- In the 5th ICS: insert over the 6th rib

**Step 4: Advance Catheter, Remove Needle**
- Once air is aspirated or "pop" felt, advance the plastic catheter fully into the pleural space
- Remove the metal needle
- Leave the catheter open to air (secures with tape)

**Step 5: Confirm Decompression**
- Rush of air with hiss = positive decompression
- Hemodynamic improvement: BP rises, SpO2 improves, tachycardia resolves
- If no improvement: reassess — wrong side? Catheter too short (didn't reach pleura)? Other cause of hemodynamic compromise?

**Step 6: Convert to Tube Thoracostomy**
- Needle decompression is temporizing only — the catheter kinks, clots, and provides inadequate ongoing drainage
- Place a chest tube as soon as possible
- Do NOT remove the angiocatheter until the chest tube is functional

### Finger Thoracostomy (Alternative — Increasingly Preferred in Trauma)

**Step 1:** Incision at 5th ICS, anterior axillary line (same site as chest tube)
**Step 2:** Blunt dissection through intercostal muscles with Kelly clamp
**Step 3:** Push through parietal pleura — rush of air
**Step 4:** Insert gloved finger, sweep 360 degrees to confirm pleural space
**Step 5:** Leave incision open (seal with occlusive dressing if needed)
**Step 6:** Insert chest tube through the same tract when ready

**Advantages of finger thoracostomy:** 100% success rate for pleural entry (vs 58-88% for needle); no risk of needle being too short; creates a tract for subsequent chest tube

### Post-Procedure
- CXR after chest tube placement to confirm lung re-expansion
- Continuous monitoring for recurrent tension (catheter obstruction)
- Document: side, site, response, transition to tube thoracostomy

## Disposition

- **Successful decompression with hemodynamic improvement:** convert to tube thoracostomy; admission
- **Failed needle decompression (no improvement):** reattempt with longer needle, attempt opposite side, or perform finger thoracostomy; consider other causes of hemodynamic compromise
- **Bilateral decompression in traumatic arrest:** continue trauma arrest algorithm; consider thoracotomy if no ROSC
- **Transfer:** if decompressed but chest tube not yet placed, transport with angiocatheter in situ and chest tube supplies available; risk of re-tensioning during transport

## Pitfalls

1. **Using a needle that is too short.** Standard 5 cm (2-inch) angiocatheters fail to reach the pleural space in 30-50% of adults at the 2nd ICS midclavicular line (chest wall thickness > 4.5 cm). Use >= 8 cm (3.25 inch) catheters. Commercial decompression needles (ARS, 10 Fr) are designed for this purpose.

2. **Inserting at the 2nd ICS midclavicular line when the 5th ICS anterior axillary line is accessible.** The 5th ICS anterior axillary line has a thinner chest wall and an 88% success rate vs 58% at the 2nd ICS. The 5th ICS is now the preferred site in TCCC and many trauma protocols.

3. **Delaying decompression for confirmatory imaging.** Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis. CXR in a supine trauma patient may not show pneumothorax. If clinical features suggest tension (absent breath sounds + hemodynamic instability), decompress immediately. The risk of needle decompression in a patient without pneumothorax is minimal compared to the risk of death from untreated tension.

4. **Not converting to tube thoracostomy after needle decompression.** The angiocatheter kinks, clots, and provides inadequate drainage. Re-tensioning occurs in up to 30% of patients with needle decompression alone. Every needle decompression must be followed by tube thoracostomy.

5. **Inserting the needle too medially at the 2nd ICS.** The subclavian vessels and internal mammary artery run 1-3 cm lateral to the sternal border. Inserting too medially risks arterial injury. The midclavicular line (midpoint between sternum and acromion) is the correct landmark. On the left, avoid injury to the heart by staying lateral.

6. **Assuming the decompression worked without confirming hemodynamic response.** After needle insertion, the patient's BP, HR, and SpO2 should improve within 30-60 seconds. If they do not, the catheter may not be in the pleural space, may be kinked, the diagnosis may be wrong, or there may be bilateral tension. Reassess and act accordingly.
