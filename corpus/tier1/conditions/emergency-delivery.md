# Emergency Delivery

## Recognition

**Indications (Delivery Imminent or in Progress):**
- Crowning visible on inspection (vertex visible at introitus)
- Patient reports irresistible urge to push with visible perineal bulging
- Imminent delivery that cannot be safely delayed for transfer to L&D
- Precipitous labor (< 3 hours from onset of contractions to delivery)
- Cord prolapse requiring emergent delivery
- Maternal cardiac arrest requiring perimortem cesarean (see perimortem-cesarean-delivery)

**When to Attempt Transfer to L&D:**
- Cervix < 8 cm dilated, no crowning, no urge to push
- Stable mother and fetus
- L&D immediately available (same hospital, < 5 minutes transport)
- If any doubt: prepare for ED delivery

**Pre-Delivery Assessment (< 2 minutes):**
- Gestational age (if known) — viability, neonatal team need
- Presentation: vertex (normal), breech (see breech-precipitous-delivery), transverse (C-section needed)
- Fetal heart rate: Doppler or bedside US (normal 110-160 bpm)
- Maternal vitals, GBS status (if known), allergies
- Number of fetuses

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| OB consultation | Immediately upon recognition of imminent ED delivery |
| Neonatal team alert | Before delivery if possible |
| Equipment assembled | < 3 minutes |
| Delivery | When mother's body is ready — do not rush |
| Cord clamp/cut | 30-60 seconds after delivery (delayed cord clamping) |
| Placenta delivery | Within 30 minutes; do NOT pull on cord |

1. **Call OB and neonatal team**
2. **Position** — dorsal lithotomy (McRoberts position readily available)
3. **Prepare equipment** — warm towels, bulb suction, cord clamp, sterile scissors
4. **Support perineum** — controlled delivery of the head
5. **Check for nuchal cord** — reduce over the head or double-clamp and cut
6. **Deliver shoulders** — anterior then posterior with gentle traction
7. **Dry and stimulate** the neonate; assess for breathing
8. **Delayed cord clamping** (30-60 seconds in vigorous neonate)
9. **Deliver placenta** — spontaneous; gentle fundal massage
10. **Assess for hemorrhage** — fundal tone, perineal lacerations, uterine atony

## Differential Diagnosis

**Complications Requiring Immediate Intervention:**

| Complication | Recognition | Immediate Action |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Shoulder dystocia | Head delivered but shoulders do not follow (turtle sign) | McRoberts + suprapubic pressure → rotational maneuvers |
| Cord prolapse | Palpable/visible cord in vagina with intact membranes or after rupture | Elevate presenting part; knee-chest position; emergent C-section |
| Breech presentation | Buttocks or feet presenting first | If delivery imminent, allow spontaneous delivery with assisted maneuvers; otherwise emergent C-section |
| Nuchal cord (tight) | Cord around neck, cannot be reduced over head | Double-clamp, cut between clamps, proceed with delivery |
| Postpartum hemorrhage | EBL > 500 mL (vaginal) or > 1000 mL (cesarean) | Uterine massage, oxytocin, bimanual compression |
| Uterine inversion | Fundus not palpable; mass in vagina | Manual replacement; do NOT remove placenta; Johnson maneuver |

## Workup

**Pre-Delivery Setup:**

| Equipment | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Warm towels/blankets | Multiple; for drying and stimulating neonate |
| Bulb suction | Neonatal bulb syringe |
| Cord clamps | 2 Kelly clamps or commercial cord clamps |
| Sterile scissors | For cord cutting |
| Sterile gloves | Gown and face shield |
| Neonatal resuscitation | Radiant warmer, BVM (neonatal size), pulse oximeter, O2 |
| Medications | Oxytocin 10 units IM (for third stage); misoprostol 800 mcg SL (backup) |
| IV fluids | 18g IV with LR running |
| Blood products | Type and screen; consider MTP if hemorrhage risk |
| Delivery kit | Sterile drapes, perineal pad, basin for placenta |

## Treatment

### Normal Vertex Vaginal Delivery

**Step 1: Support the Head**
- As the head crowns, apply gentle pressure with a gloved hand on the perineum (modified Ritgen maneuver: fingers behind anus push chin anteriorly while other hand controls head delivery speed)
- Allow slow, controlled delivery of the head — avoid rapid expulsion (increases perineal laceration risk)
- Coach breathing: "Pant, don't push" during head delivery to control speed

**Step 2: Check for Nuchal Cord**
- Immediately after head delivers, feel around the neck for umbilical cord
- Loose nuchal cord: slip it over the baby's head
- Tight nuchal cord (cannot reduce): double-clamp with Kelly clamps and cut between clamps; proceed with delivery

**Step 3: Deliver Shoulders**
- Suction mouth then nose with bulb syringe (if meconium, suction before body delivers)
- Gentle downward traction on the head to deliver the anterior shoulder under the symphysis
- Then gentle upward traction to deliver the posterior shoulder over the perineum
- DO NOT apply excessive traction — risk of brachial plexus injury

**Step 4: Deliver Body**
- The body follows quickly after shoulders; support with both hands
- Note the time of delivery

**Step 5: Immediate Neonatal Care**
- Place baby skin-to-skin on mother's abdomen (if vigorous)
- Dry thoroughly with warm towels — drying is the primary stimulus for breathing
- Assess breathing and tone (APGAR at 1 and 5 minutes)
- Delayed cord clamping: wait 30-60 seconds (in vigorous term neonates) before clamping and cutting
- Clamp cord in two places, 2-3 cm from the neonate; cut between clamps

**Step 6: Third Stage (Placenta Delivery)**
- Administer oxytocin 10 units IM immediately after delivery (active management of third stage)
- Signs of placental separation: gush of blood, cord lengthening, uterine fundus rises
- Apply gentle cord traction (Brandt-Andrews maneuver) with counter-pressure on the uterus (one hand suprapubic)
- Inspect placenta for completeness (missing cotyledon = retained products)
- Normal delivery time: 5-30 minutes; if > 30 minutes = retained placenta (manual removal under anesthesia or OB consult)

### Shoulder Dystocia Management (HELPERR Mnemonic)

**H** — Help: call for assistance (OB, anesthesia, NICU)
**E** — Evaluate for episiotomy (consider if soft tissue is the limiting factor; bone-on-bone dystocia not helped by episiotomy)
**L** — Legs: McRoberts position (hyperflexion of maternal hips against abdomen; widens pelvic outlet by 1-2 cm; flattens lumbar lordosis)
**P** — Pressure: suprapubic pressure (directed posteriorly and laterally to dislodge anterior shoulder from behind symphysis; NOT fundal pressure — this worsens impaction)
**E** — Enter: internal rotation maneuvers (Rubin II — pressure on posterior aspect of anterior shoulder toward fetal chest; or Woods corkscrew — rotate posterior shoulder 180 degrees)
**R** — Remove posterior arm (reach in, flex fetal elbow, sweep forearm across chest to deliver)
**R** — Roll: Gaskin maneuver (roll patient to all-fours/hands-and-knees position; changes pelvic dimensions; gravity assists)

**DO NOT:**
- Apply fundal pressure (worsens impaction, increases uterine rupture and brachial plexus injury risk)
- Pull excessively on the fetal head (brachial plexus injury)
- Rush — calm, systematic progression through maneuvers

### Postpartum Hemorrhage Management

**Uterine Atony (most common cause, 80%):**
- Bimanual uterine massage (vigorous fundal massage)
- Oxytocin 20-40 units in 1 L LR, run wide open
- Methylergonovine (Methergine) 0.2 mg IM (contraindicated in hypertension)
- Carboprost (Hemabate) 250 mcg IM q15min (max 8 doses; contraindicated in asthma)
- Misoprostol 800-1000 mcg sublingual or rectal
- Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 minutes (within 3 hours of delivery)
- If pharmacologic measures fail: intrauterine balloon tamponade (Bakri balloon) or bimanual uterine compression as bridge to OR

### Post-Delivery
- Inspect perineum for lacerations; repair 2nd degree or greater
- Monitor maternal vitals q5min for first 30 minutes; quantify blood loss
- Neonatal assessment: APGAR, weight, glucose
- Maternal labs: CBC, type and screen, fibrinogen (if hemorrhage)

## Disposition

- **Uncomplicated delivery:** mother and neonate to L&D/postpartum for monitoring; admission minimum 24 hours
- **Shoulder dystocia:** neonatal assessment for brachial plexus injury, clavicle fracture; pediatric follow-up
- **Postpartum hemorrhage:** ICU if hemodynamically unstable; OR if surgical intervention required
- **Preterm delivery (< 37 weeks):** NICU admission for neonate
- **Transfer:** if no L&D at facility, stabilize mother and neonate; transfer with warming, monitoring, and neonatal resuscitation capability

## Pitfalls

1. **Applying fundal pressure during shoulder dystocia.** Fundal pressure drives the anterior shoulder further against the pubic symphysis, worsening impaction. It increases the risk of brachial plexus injury and uterine rupture. Use SUPRAPUBIC pressure (directed posteriorly and laterally) — not FUNDAL pressure.

2. **Not recognizing the "turtle sign" as shoulder dystocia.** After the head delivers, if it retracts tightly against the perineum (turtle sign) and the shoulders do not deliver with the next contraction, this is shoulder dystocia. Immediately call for help and initiate McRoberts positioning — do not waste time with further maternal pushing alone.

3. **Pulling excessively on the fetal head to deliver shoulders.** Excessive traction on the head stretches the brachial plexus, causing Erb palsy (C5-C6) or total plexus palsy. Gentle, controlled traction combined with maternal positioning and rotational maneuvers is the standard.

4. **Failing to give oxytocin after delivery of the placenta.** Active management of the third stage (oxytocin 10 units IM after delivery) reduces postpartum hemorrhage by 60%. Omitting this is the single most preventable cause of PPH.

5. **Pulling on the umbilical cord to deliver the placenta.** Excessive cord traction before placental separation causes uterine inversion — a life-threatening emergency. Apply gentle cord traction ONLY with signs of placental separation and concurrent suprapubic counter-pressure.

6. **Not preparing for neonatal resuscitation.** 10% of newborns require some intervention at birth; 1% require extensive resuscitation. Have warm towels, bulb suction, a neonatal BVM, and pulse oximetry ready before delivery. Call the neonatal team early.
