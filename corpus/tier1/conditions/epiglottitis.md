# Acute Epiglottitis

## Recognition

**Definition:** Rapidly progressive inflammation of the epiglottis and surrounding supraglottic structures, causing airway obstruction. Now predominantly an adult disease in the post-Hib vaccine era.

### Classic Presentation
- Severe sore throat disproportionate to pharyngeal findings
- Dysphagia, odynophagia, drooling
- Muffled "hot potato" voice
- Stridor (late and ominous — indicates >50% airway narrowing)
- Tripod positioning, neck extension ("sniffing position")
- Rapid onset (hours, not days)
- Fever, toxic appearance

### Adult vs Pediatric Differences
| Feature | Pediatric (rare post-vaccine) | Adult |
|---|---|---|
| Onset | Fulminant (hours) | Subacute possible (12-24 hours) |
| Drooling | Common | Less common |
| Airway obstruction | Rapid, higher risk | Variable, still dangerous |
| Etiology | H. influenzae type B (if unvaccinated) | Polymicrobial; Strep, Staph, H. influenzae non-typeable |
| Thumbprint sign | Classic | Present in 60-80% |

### Red Flags for Imminent Airway Loss
- Stridor at rest
- Inability to swallow secretions
- Sitting upright, refusing to lie down
- Cyanosis
- Altered mental status
- Rapid clinical deterioration

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Airway assessment and preparation | Immediately on recognition |
| Keep patient upright | Do NOT force supine positioning |
| ENT + Anesthesia notification | Immediately — dual call |
| Definitive airway management | OR/controlled environment preferred |
| IV antibiotics | As soon as IV access obtained |
| Avoid agitation | No blind nasopharyngeal procedures |

1. Maintain the patient in the position of comfort (usually sitting upright)
2. Prepare for difficult airway: double setup (oral intubation + surgical airway)
3. Call ENT and anesthesia immediately for controlled airway management
4. Administer humidified oxygen via blow-by (do NOT force mask on distressed patient)
5. Establish IV access and start antibiotics
6. Have tracheostomy/cricothyrotomy tray at bedside
7. Avoid direct laryngoscopy in the ED unless airway is lost

## Differential Diagnosis

- Peritonsillar abscess (unilateral tonsillar swelling, uvular deviation, trismus)
- Retropharyngeal abscess (neck stiffness, widened prevertebral space on lateral neck X-ray)
- Ludwig angina (floor-of-mouth swelling, bilateral submandibular induration, "bull neck")
- Croup (pediatric, barking cough, subglottic narrowing — "steeple sign")
- Angioedema (lip/tongue swelling, urticaria, ACE-inhibitor history, no fever)
- Foreign body aspiration (sudden onset, choking event, unilateral findings)
- Bacterial tracheitis (post-viral, purulent secretions, subglottic)
- Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (gradual onset, no drooling, no airway compromise)
- Inhalation injury (burn history, soot in oropharynx, singed facial hair)

## Workup

- **Lateral neck X-ray (soft tissue):** Thumbprint sign (swollen epiglottis) — 79-88% sensitivity. Obtain ONLY if patient is stable; do NOT delay airway management for imaging.
- **CT neck with IV contrast:** Superior sensitivity for abscess and extent of swelling; obtain only in stable patients when diagnosis is uncertain
- **Flexible nasopharyngoscopy:** Definitive diagnosis — erythematous, edematous epiglottis ("cherry-red"). Perform in controlled environment with airway backup. ENT performs this.
- **Blood cultures:** Obtain before antibiotics when feasible; positive in 10-25% of cases
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis with left shift
- **Direct laryngoscopy in OR:** Gold standard if patient requires intubation

**Do NOT obtain:** Throat swab (risk of laryngospasm), any procedure requiring supine positioning in unstable patients.

## Treatment

### Airway Management
- **Stable patient (no stridor, able to swallow):** Close observation in monitored setting with airway equipment at bedside; ENT at bedside
- **Unstable patient (stridor, drooling, distress):** Controlled intubation in OR preferred (ENT + anesthesia dual setup)
- **Intubation approach:** Fiber-optic intubation preferred; video laryngoscopy as backup; use ETT 1-2 sizes smaller than predicted
- **Failed intubation:** Surgical cricothyrotomy (adults) or needle cricothyrotomy with jet ventilation (pediatric)
- **Racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution nebulized** — temporizing measure only; may reduce edema enough to buy time

### Antibiotics
- **Ceftriaxone 2 g IV every 24 hours** PLUS **vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV every 8-12 hours** (MRSA coverage in critically ill)
- **Alternative:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours (if low MRSA risk)
- Narrow based on culture results
- Duration: 7-10 days IV initially, step down to oral when clinical improvement

### Corticosteroids
- **Dexamethasone 10 mg IV initial dose, then 4 mg IV every 6 hours x 24-48 hours** — reduces supraglottic edema, facilitates earlier extubation
- Limited high-quality evidence but widely used and low risk

### Adjuncts
- **Humidified oxygen:** Blow-by preferred to face mask in distressed patients
- **Heliox (70:30 helium-oxygen):** Reduces work of breathing through turbulent flow reduction; temporizing measure only. Not usable if FiO2 requirement > 30%.
- **IV fluid resuscitation:** Patients are often dehydrated from dysphagia

## Disposition

- **ICU:** All patients with stridor, airway instrumentation, or inability to manage secretions
- **ICU or step-down:** Stable patients with confirmed epiglottitis for close airway monitoring (minimum 24 hours)
- **Never discharge from ED.** All patients with confirmed or suspected epiglottitis require admission for observation of airway progression.
- **Extubation:** In OR or ICU with direct visualization confirming decreased edema; typically 48-72 hours after intubation

## Pitfalls

1. **Forcing the patient supine for examination or imaging.** Supine positioning collapses the already compromised airway. Examine and image with the patient sitting upright.

2. **Performing blind oropharyngeal exam with a tongue depressor.** Direct oropharyngeal manipulation triggers laryngospasm and complete airway obstruction. Use flexible nasopharyngoscopy in a controlled setting.

3. **Delaying ENT/anesthesia notification because the patient "looks stable."** Epiglottitis deteriorates unpredictably. Dual specialty notification (ENT + anesthesia) happens at time of suspicion, not after confirmation.

4. **Anchoring on the classic pediatric presentation in adults.** Adult epiglottitis presents with severe sore throat and dysphagia more than stridor and drooling. A severe sore throat with a relatively normal oropharyngeal exam demands further evaluation.

5. **Attempting ED intubation in a semi-stable patient.** OR intubation with fiber-optic guidance, ENT backup, and surgical airway readiness is the standard. ED intubation is reserved for complete airway loss.

6. **Discharging as "pharyngitis" without visualizing the epiglottis.** The oropharynx appears deceptively normal in epiglottitis — the pathology is supraglottic. Severe sore throat with pain out of proportion to exam findings warrants lateral neck X-ray or nasopharyngoscopy.

7. **Omitting MRSA coverage in critically ill patients.** Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus causes epiglottitis, particularly in immunocompromised patients and those with healthcare exposure. Add vancomycin in severe cases.

8. **Relying on a normal lateral neck X-ray to exclude epiglottitis.** Sensitivity is only 79-88%. A negative X-ray in a patient with high clinical suspicion requires direct visualization or CT.

9. **Failing to have a surgical airway kit at bedside.** Cricothyrotomy equipment must be immediately available. Do not rely solely on orotracheal intubation plans.
