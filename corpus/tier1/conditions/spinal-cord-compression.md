# Spinal Cord Compression

## Recognition

**Two primary clinical syndromes:**

### Spinal Cord Compression (Upper Motor Neuron Pattern — Lesion Above Conus Medullaris)
- Progressive weakness (initially legs, may progress to arms if cervical)
- Spastic paraparesis/quadriparesis (increased tone, hyperreflexia, clonus)
- Upgoing plantar responses (Babinski sign)
- Sensory level (dermatomal distribution — band of hyperesthesia at level, loss below)
- Bowel/bladder dysfunction (late finding — urinary retention, overflow incontinence, constipation)
- Back pain (90% of malignant cord compression; worse with recumbency, night pain)
- Lhermitte sign (electrical sensation radiating down spine with neck flexion — cervical myelopathy)

### Cauda Equina Syndrome (Lower Motor Neuron Pattern — Lesion Below Conus at L1-L2)
- Bilateral leg weakness (flaccid, hyporeflexic)
- Saddle anesthesia (perineal numbness — S2-S5 dermatomes)
- Urinary retention (post-void residual > 200 mL is significant)
- Decreased rectal tone
- Bilateral radiculopathy, sciatica
- Sexual dysfunction

**Etiologies:**
- **Malignant:** Metastatic epidural compression (breast, lung, prostate, renal, myeloma most common); primary spinal tumors
- **Infectious:** Epidural abscess (fever, back pain, neurological deficit; risk factors: IVDU, diabetes, recent spinal procedure, immunosuppression)
- **Degenerative:** Cervical spondylotic myelopathy, large disc herniation, spinal stenosis with acute decompensation
- **Vascular:** Spinal epidural hematoma (anticoagulation, post-procedure, coagulopathy)
- **Traumatic:** Vertebral fracture with retropulsion, burst fracture
- **Inflammatory:** Transverse myelitis

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Neurological exam (motor, sensory, rectal tone) | < 10 minutes |
| MRI of entire spine | Emergent (< 4 hours) |
| Dexamethasone for malignant cord compression | Immediately upon clinical suspicion |
| Surgical/radiation oncology consultation | Within 1 hour of diagnosis |

1. **Document neurological baseline:** Motor exam of all extremities (MRC scale), sensory level, rectal tone, post-void residual (bladder scan)
2. **MRI entire spine with and without gadolinium:** Gold standard; image entire spine (multi-level disease in 30% of malignant cord compression)
3. **Dexamethasone** for suspected malignant cord compression: 10 mg IV bolus immediately, then 4 mg IV q6h (start BEFORE imaging — do not delay for MRI results)
4. **Bladder catheterization** if urinary retention present
5. **Urgent surgical consultation** (neurosurgery or orthopedic spine)
6. **Radiation oncology consultation** for malignant cord compression

## Differential Diagnosis

- Guillain-Barre syndrome (ascending paralysis, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation in CSF — NO sensory level)
- Transverse myelitis (inflammatory; MRI shows intramedullary cord signal, not extrinsic compression)
- Multiple sclerosis flare (prior episodes, MRI white matter lesions)
- Spinal cord infarction (anterior spinal artery syndrome: acute onset, bilateral motor/pain-temperature loss, preserved proprioception)
- Peripheral neuropathy (distal > proximal, stocking-glove pattern)
- Conversion disorder (inconsistent exam findings, no MRI abnormality)
- Conus medullaris syndrome (mixed UMN/LMN, early bowel/bladder dysfunction, symmetric)
- Epidural lipomatosis (chronic steroid use, obesity)

## Workup

- **MRI entire spine with gadolinium:** Urgent; defines location, extent, and etiology of compression; whole-spine imaging is essential (30% have multi-level disease)
- **CT myelography:** If MRI contraindicated (pacemaker, metallic implant) or unavailable
- **Plain radiographs:** Low sensitivity for early disease; may show vertebral body collapse, pedicle erosion ("winking owl" sign on AP view)
- **CBC, BMP, coagulation studies**
- **ESR, CRP:** Elevated in infection and malignancy
- **Blood cultures x 2** if epidural abscess suspected
- **PSA, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP):** If unknown primary malignancy
- **CT chest/abdomen/pelvis:** Staging if new malignancy diagnosis
- **Post-void residual** by bladder scan (> 200 mL supports cauda equina syndrome)
- **Urinalysis:** Rule out UTI as cause of urinary symptoms

## Treatment

### Malignant Spinal Cord Compression
- **Dexamethasone** 10 mg IV bolus, then 4 mg IV q6h (reduces vasogenic edema; improves outcomes if given early)
- **Surgical decompression + stabilization** within 24 hours for: single level, good functional status (ambulatory), life expectancy > 3 months, radioresistant tumor, spinal instability, neurological deterioration during radiation (Patchell trial: surgery + radiation superior to radiation alone)
- **Radiation therapy:** Start within 24 hours; first-line for radiosensitive tumors (lymphoma, myeloma, small cell lung cancer), multiple levels of compression, poor surgical candidates
- **Pain management:** Oxycodone 5-10 mg PO q4-6h PRN; morphine 2-4 mg IV q2-4h for severe pain; dexamethasone itself provides significant analgesic effect

### Epidural Abscess
- **Emergent surgical drainage** (laminectomy and debridement) — surgical emergency if neurological deficits are progressing
- **IV antibiotics immediately:** Vancomycin 25-30 mg/kg IV loading dose + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h (or cefepime 2 g IV q8h) to cover Staphylococcus aureus (most common) and gram-negatives
- Medical management alone (antibiotics without surgery): only if no neurological deficit, organism identified, and close MRI surveillance available

### Cauda Equina Syndrome
- **Emergent surgical decompression** within 24-48 hours (ideally < 24 hours)
- Delay beyond 48 hours associated with irreversible bowel/bladder dysfunction
- Disc herniation: microdiscectomy
- Tumor: decompressive laminectomy +/- stabilization

### Spinal Epidural Hematoma
- **Reverse anticoagulation immediately:** Vitamin K 10 mg IV + 4-factor PCC 25-50 units/kg IV (warfarin); idarucizumab 5 g IV (dabigatran); andexanet alfa (factor Xa inhibitors)
- **Emergent surgical evacuation** if neurological deficit present

### Traumatic Cord Compression
- Spinal immobilization
- Emergent surgical decompression and stabilization per spine surgery

## Disposition

- **Operating room:** Progressive neurological deficit from any compressive etiology, cauda equina syndrome with urinary retention, epidural abscess with deficits, epidural hematoma
- **ICU:** Post-operative, hemodynamically unstable, respiratory compromise (high cervical lesion), sepsis from epidural abscess
- **Oncology/neurosurgery admission:** Malignant cord compression for coordinated radiation/surgery
- **Transfer:** If no emergent MRI or spine surgery capability; do NOT delay dexamethasone or antibiotics while arranging transfer
- **Discharge:** Not appropriate if cord compression or cauda equina syndrome is suspected or confirmed

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing bilateral leg weakness and urinary retention to "UTI" or "sciatica."** Bilateral symptoms, saddle anesthesia, and urinary retention constitute cauda equina syndrome until proven otherwise. Rectal exam and post-void residual are mandatory. Delay in diagnosis results in permanent deficits.

2. **Imaging only the symptomatic spinal level.** Multi-level disease occurs in 30% of metastatic cord compression. Whole-spine MRI is the standard of care. Imaging a single region misses additional compression sites and changes surgical planning.

3. **Delaying dexamethasone until MRI confirms compression.** In patients with known malignancy and new back pain with neurological deficits, start dexamethasone immediately. The risk of a single dose in the absence of compression is negligible; the cost of delay is irreversible paralysis.

4. **Missing epidural abscess in IVDU patients presenting with back pain.** The triad of fever, back pain, and neurological deficit has poor sensitivity — deficits are a late finding. Elevated ESR/CRP in IVDU or immunocompromised patients with back pain warrants emergent MRI.

5. **Not performing a rectal exam.** Decreased rectal tone is a key finding in cauda equina syndrome. Documenting rectal tone is both clinically and medicolegally essential.

6. **Assuming urinary retention is from BPH or anticholinergic medication.** New-onset urinary retention in the setting of back pain or bilateral leg symptoms requires urgent evaluation for cauda equina syndrome, regardless of the patient's age or medication list.

7. **Failure to check post-void residual.** Patients may not report urinary retention, especially those with altered sensation. A bladder scan showing > 200 mL post-void residual is an objective finding that supports cauda equina syndrome and should prompt emergent MRI.

8. **Discharging a patient with progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness for outpatient MRI.** This is a surgical emergency. Outpatient MRI scheduled for days later results in irreversible paralysis. If MRI is unavailable, transfer the patient.

9. **Overlooking spinal epidural hematoma in anticoagulated patients.** Acute-onset back pain with rapid neurological deterioration in a patient on anticoagulation warrants emergent MRI and immediate anticoagulation reversal. Surgical window is narrow (< 12-24 hours).
