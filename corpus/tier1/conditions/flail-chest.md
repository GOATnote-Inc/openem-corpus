# Flail Chest

## Recognition

**Definition:** Three or more contiguous ribs fractured in two or more places each, creating a free-floating segment that moves paradoxically with respiration.

**Mechanism:** High-energy blunt chest trauma — MVC, fall from height, crush injury. More common in elderly (osteoporotic ribs).

**Presentation:**
- Paradoxical chest wall movement (flail segment moves inward during inspiration, outward during expiration) — may not be visible early due to splinting and muscle spasm
- Severe chest wall pain, worse with breathing
- Dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxia
- Chest wall crepitus, ecchymosis
- Decreased breath sounds (underlying pulmonary contusion)
- Shallow, rapid breathing to minimize pain

**Associated injuries (nearly always present):**
- Pulmonary contusion (present in > 75%) — the primary cause of hypoxia
- Pneumothorax/hemothorax
- Cardiac contusion (anterior flail)
- Great vessel injury
- Abdominal solid organ injury (lower rib flail)
- Scapular fracture (posterior flail — extremely high energy)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Secure airway if respiratory failure | Immediate |
| Chest X-ray/FAST | < 15 minutes |
| CT chest | < 60 minutes |
| Aggressive pain control | < 30 minutes |

1. **Assess and support ventilation** — supplemental O2, monitor SpO2 and RR continuously. Do NOT strap or bind the flail segment (restricts ventilation).
2. **Aggressive multimodal analgesia** — pain is the primary cause of respiratory failure:
   - Epidural catheter (gold standard per EAST): bupivacaine 0.1% + hydromorphone 10 mcg/mL continuous infusion
   - Alternative: paravertebral nerve block with ropivacaine 0.5% 5 mL per level
   - Systemic: fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV q30min PRN for breakthrough + ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (if no renal impairment or hemorrhage) + acetaminophen 1 g IV q6h
3. **Positive pressure ventilation** if respiratory failure — intubate for SpO2 < 90% despite supplemental O2, RR > 35, PaCO2 > 50, or progressive exhaustion. Use lung-protective ventilation (TV 6 mL/kg IBW, PEEP 5-10 cmH2O).
4. **Tube thoracostomy** if pneumothorax or hemothorax (36-40 Fr chest tube)
5. **Consult trauma surgery** for rib fixation evaluation

## Differential Diagnosis

- Multiple rib fractures without flail (no free segment)
- Sternal fracture with anterior chest wall instability
- Pulmonary contusion without flail (hypoxia from parenchymal injury)
- Tension pneumothorax (unilateral absent breath sounds, hypotension, tracheal deviation)
- Hemothorax (dullness to percussion, hypotension)
- Cardiac tamponade (Beck triad — hypotension, JVD, muffled heart sounds)
- Diaphragmatic rupture (bowel sounds in chest)

## Workup

- **Chest X-ray** — identifies rib fractures, pneumothorax, hemothorax, widened mediastinum. May undercount fractures.
- **CT chest with IV contrast** — gold standard: delineates all fractures, quantifies contusion volume, identifies pneumothorax, hemothorax, and associated injuries
- **FAST exam** — hemothorax, pericardial effusion, abdominal free fluid
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, ABG/VBG (PaO2, PaCO2), lactate, type and crossmatch, coagulation studies, troponin (rule out cardiac contusion)
- **ECG** — arrhythmia screening for cardiac contusion
- **Incentive spirometry target** — baseline and serial monitoring (< 15 mL/kg indicates poor effort/pain)
- **Pulmonary contusion volume on CT** — contusion > 20% lung volume predicts need for mechanical ventilation

## Treatment

**Pain management (paramount):**
- Thoracic epidural analgesia: first-line per EAST guideline. Catheter placed at level of injury. Bupivacaine 0.1% + hydromorphone 10 mcg/mL at 4-8 mL/hr
- Paravertebral block: ropivacaine 0.5% 4-5 mL per level, catheter for continuous infusion; similar efficacy to epidural with fewer complications
- Intercostal nerve block: bupivacaine 0.25% 3-5 mL per rib level (temporary, lasts 6-12 hours)
- IV opioids: fentanyl PCA 10-20 mcg demand dose, 6-min lockout; or hydromorphone 0.2-0.5 mg IV q2-4h PRN
- Adjuncts: ketorolac 15 mg IV q6h (caution with hemorrhage/renal); acetaminophen 1 g IV/PO q6h; lidocaine patch 5% over fractures; gabapentin 300 mg PO TID for neuropathic component

**Respiratory support:**
- High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) 40-60 L/min, FiO2 titrated to SpO2 > 94%
- NIPPV (BiPAP) if tolerated: IPAP 10-15, EPAP 5-8 cmH2O (provides internal pneumatic splinting)
- Intubation for failure: SpO2 < 90% on HFNC/NIPPV, RR > 35, PaCO2 > 50, altered mental status
- Lung-protective ventilation: TV 6 mL/kg IBW, PEEP 5-10, plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O

**Pulmonary toilet:**
- Aggressive incentive spirometry (goal ≥ 15 mL/kg)
- Early mobilization (sit upright, out of bed)
- Chest physiotherapy
- Mucolytics PRN: nebulized hypertonic saline 3% q4-6h

**Surgical rib fixation (SSRF):**
- Consider for: failure to wean from ventilator, severe chest wall deformity, pain refractory to regional anesthesia, need for thoracotomy for other reasons
- Optimal timing: days 2-5 post-injury
- Titanium plates/splints to stabilize fractures
- Growing evidence supports early fixation — reduced ventilator days, ICU LOS, pneumonia rates

**Fluid management:**
- Avoid aggressive overresuscitation (worsens contusion)
- Do NOT restrict fluids at the expense of perfusion
- Target euvolemia guided by clinical assessment

**Steroids:** NOT recommended for pulmonary contusion (EAST guideline).

## Disposition

- **ICU admission:** All flail chest — continuous monitoring, serial ABGs, epidural management
- **Trauma surgery consult:** All cases for SSRF consideration
- **Anesthesia/pain service consult:** Epidural or regional analgesia
- **Step-down:** When weaned from supplemental O2, adequate pain control on oral regimen, incentive spirometry > 15 mL/kg
- **Anticipate prolonged stay:** Average ICU 7-14 days, hospital 14-21 days
- **Transfer:** Level I/II trauma center if thoracic surgery not available

## Pitfalls

1. **Focusing on the flail segment instead of the underlying pulmonary contusion.** Contusion causes the hypoxia, not the paradoxical motion. Contusion worsens over 24-48 hours — anticipate delayed respiratory deterioration.

2. **Binding or strapping the flail segment.** This was historical management and is harmful — restricts ventilation, promotes atelectasis and pneumonia.

3. **Withholding opioids due to concern for respiratory depression.** Inadequate analgesia causes splinting, atelectasis, retained secretions, and pneumonia — the primary killers. Aggressive pain control (ideally epidural) reduces intubation rates.

4. **Not anticipating the 24-48 hour window of worsening.** Pulmonary contusion peaks at 24-48 hours. Patients who look stable initially may decompensate. Serial ABGs and clinical reassessment are mandatory.

5. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation worsening pulmonary contusion.** While euvolemia is the goal, excessive crystalloid worsens contusion edema. Balance resuscitation needs against pulmonary status.

6. **Missing lower rib fractures with associated abdominal injury.** Fractures of ribs 9-12 have high association with splenic laceration (left) and liver laceration (right). FAST exam and CT abdomen are essential.
