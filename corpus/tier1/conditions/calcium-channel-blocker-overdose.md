# Calcium Channel Blocker Overdose

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) block L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in cardiac nodal tissue, myocardium, and vascular smooth muscle. In overdose: bradycardia and AV block (nodal effects), reduced myocardial contractility (cardiogenic shock), and vasodilation (distributive component). Dihydropyridines (amlodipine, nifedipine) preferentially affect vascular smooth muscle → profound vasodilation with reflex tachycardia at therapeutic doses; in overdose, selectivity is lost and myocardial depression occurs. Phenylalkylamines (verapamil) and benzothiazepines (diltiazem) affect cardiac tissue more and vascular tissue to a lesser degree.

**Drug-Specific Characteristics:**
- **Verapamil (Calan, Isoptin):** Highest myocardial/nodal toxicity. SR formulations cause delayed presentation (6-12h). Most fatalities.
- **Diltiazem (Cardizem):** Intermediate toxicity; SR formulations delayed.
- **Amlodipine (Norvasc):** Predominantly vasodilatory; extremely long half-life (30-50h); deceptively late-onset toxicity (may be stable x24h then deteriorate).
- **Nifedipine:** Short-acting; toxicity appears within 4-6h.

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Bradycardia (sinus, junctional, or complete AV block)
- Hypotension (cardiogenic and/or distributive)
- Altered mental status (decreased perfusion, not direct CNS effect)
- Pallor, diaphoresis, cool extremities
- Nausea, vomiting
- Pulmonary edema from cardiogenic shock
- Peripheral vasodilation with warm extremities (amlodipine/dihydropyridines)

**Classic Toxidrome: Bradycardia + Hypotension + Hyperglycemia.** Hyperglycemia occurs because calcium channels in pancreatic beta cells are blocked → impaired insulin secretion despite elevated glucose. Hyperglycemia in a bradycardic/hypotensive patient strongly suggests CCB toxicity.

**Timeline:**
- Immediate-release formulations: onset 30-60 min, peak toxicity 1-2h
- Extended-release/SR formulations: onset delayed 4-12h, symptoms up to 24h post-ingestion. Patient may be asymptomatic and "fine" on initial presentation.

## Critical Actions

1. **Calcium chloride 10% solution 20-30 mL (2-3 g) IV** via central venous access, over 5-10 minutes, or calcium gluconate 60-90 mL (6-9 g) IV (three times the volume for equivalent calcium). Repeat every 15-20 minutes x 3-4 doses for persistent bradycardia/hypotension. Calcium gluconate may be given peripherally; calcium chloride requires central access (vesicant). Calcium does NOT reverse CCB toxicity completely but improves hemodynamics transiently.

2. **High-dose insulin euglycemia (HDI) — start early, do not wait for clinical deterioration.** Regular insulin 1 unit/kg IV bolus, then 1 unit/kg/hr continuous infusion. Glucose 25g (50 mL D50W) IV bolus concurrently if glucose <250 mg/dL; then D10W or D25W infusion titrated to glucose 150-250 mg/dL. Check glucose every 15-30 minutes initially. Mechanism: cardiomyocytes in shock preferentially oxidize carbohydrates over free fatty acids; insulin provides energy substrate directly to myocardium. Improves inotropy. Doses up to 10 units/kg/hr have been used in refractory cases.

3. **IV lipid emulsion (ILE) for lipophilic agents** — 20% lipid emulsion 1.5 mL/kg IV over 1 minute, then 0.25 mL/kg/min for 30-60 minutes (max total 10 mL/kg). Most effective for lipophilic CCBs (verapamil, amlodipine). Mechanism: "lipid sink" — sequesters lipophilic drug in plasma. Use for hemodynamically unstable patient not responding to calcium + HDI.

4. **Vasopressors for distributive component** — norepinephrine 0.1-2 mcg/kg/min IV titrated to MAP >65 mmHg. Add vasopressin 0.04 units/min IV for refractory vasodilation. Avoid dopamine as primary agent (norepinephrine superior for vasodilatory shock).

5. **Atropine for bradycardia** — 0.5-1 mg IV; repeat every 3-5 minutes to max 3 mg. Frequently ineffective in CCB overdose (cholinergic blockade does not overcome calcium channel block) but safe first attempt.

6. **Transcutaneous pacing** for high-degree AV block or severe bradycardia not responding to medications. Transvenous pacing if transcutaneous fails. Pacing captures electrical rhythm but mechanical capture (and thus hemodynamics) may not follow in severe toxicity.

7. **Methylene blue 1.5-2 mg/kg IV** for refractory vasodilatory shock unresponsive to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and calcium. Mechanism: inhibits guanylate cyclase, reducing nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. Repeat dosing at 1 mg/kg every 30 minutes (max 7 mg/kg).

8. **ECMO/mechanical circulatory support** — consider ECMO for refractory cardiogenic shock despite maximal pharmacologic therapy. Contact ECMO center early; do not wait until pre-arrest.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Beta-blocker overdose | Similar presentation; no hyperglycemia (beta-blockade causes hypoglycemia); glucagon is first-line (not helpful in CCB OD) |
| Digoxin toxicity | Dysrhythmias with specific ECG pattern; elevated digoxin level; digoxin Fab available |
| Clonidine overdose | Bradycardia, miosis, altered mental status; responds to naloxone (partial) |
| Acute MI with cardiogenic shock | Troponin elevation, ECG ST changes; no ingestion history |
| Complete heart block (primary) | Structural cardiac disease history; no ingestion history |
| Hyperkalemia | Wide QRS, peaked T waves, no P waves; serum K+ diagnostic |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- Electrolytes, BMP — hyperglycemia (CCB toxidrome), baseline creatinine
- Serum potassium — hypokalemia may contribute to arrhythmia; hyperkalemia worsened by crush/shock
- Calcium level — ionized calcium; may normalize rapidly after treatment
- Glucose — serial every 15-30 min during HDI
- Lactate — tissue perfusion marker; guides resuscitation
- Troponin — myocardial injury from prolonged shock
- CBC
- Acetaminophen and salicylate levels (co-ingestion screen)
- Serum drug level: not routinely useful for management decisions; quantitative CCB levels not clinically actionable in real time

**12-Lead ECG:**
- PR prolongation, AV block (1st, 2nd, 3rd degree)
- Sinus bradycardia or junctional escape rhythm
- QRS widening in severe toxicity (sodium channel effects of verapamil at high doses)
- Wide complex tachycardia (rare)
- Normal ECG does not exclude significant toxicity, especially early in extended-release ingestion

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous cardiac monitoring
- Arterial line for beat-to-beat BP monitoring in unstable patients
- Glucose every 15-30 minutes during HDI therapy
- Central venous access (for calcium chloride, vasopressors)

## Treatment

**Summary of Pharmacologic Ladder (titrate aggressively — do not underdose):**

1. **Calcium salts** (first-line): CaCl2 10% 20-30 mL IV q15-20 min x 4; or Ca gluconate 60-90 mL
2. **High-dose insulin (HDI)** (start simultaneously with calcium, not sequentially): Regular insulin 1 unit/kg bolus → 1 unit/kg/hr infusion; glucose supplementation as above
3. **Vasopressors**: Norepinephrine 0.1-2 mcg/kg/min; vasopressin 0.04 units/min
4. **Atropine**: 0.5-1 mg IV (max 3 mg); pacing if fails
5. **IV lipid emulsion**: 20% ILE 1.5 mL/kg bolus → 0.25 mL/kg/min
6. **Glucagon** (less effective than in beta-blocker OD but reasonable to try): 3-10 mg IV bolus then 3-10 mg/hr
7. **Methylene blue**: 1.5-2 mg/kg IV for refractory vasodilation
8. **ECMO**: ECPR for refractory cardiac arrest

**GI Decontamination:**
- Activated charcoal 1 g/kg PO (max 50g) within 1-2 hours if airway intact
- Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol 1-2 L/hr PO/NG for extended-release ingestions: continue until clear effluent; reduces absorption of slow-release matrices

**Disposition Consideration for Extended-Release CCBs:**
- All extended-release CCB ingestions require minimum 24-hour monitored observation regardless of initial presentation, because onset of toxicity may be delayed 4-12 hours.

## Disposition

**ICU admission for all symptomatic patients and all extended-release CCB ingestions.**

**ICU:**
- Any bradycardia, hypotension, AV block
- Extended-release formulation (symptomatic OR asymptomatic — 24h minimum)
- Active HDI, vasopressors, or antidote infusions
- Any hemodynamic instability

**Monitored Observation (minimum 24 hours):**
- Asymptomatic ingestion of immediate-release formulation — observe 6-8 hours
- Asymptomatic ingestion of extended-release formulation — observe minimum 24 hours with telemetry; do not discharge at 6 hours
- Serial ECGs, glucose monitoring

**Discharge Criteria (immediate-release only):**
- Normal vital signs throughout 6-8 hour observation
- Normal ECG at end of observation
- No co-ingestions requiring further monitoring
- Psychiatric evaluation if intentional

## Pitfalls

1. **Discharging an asymptomatic extended-release CCB ingestion after 4-6 hours.** This is the most common fatal error in CCB overdose management. Extended-release preparations (SR, XL, CD, ER formulations) have delayed absorption; a patient with amlodipine OD may be hemodynamically normal for 12-24 hours before rapid deterioration. All extended-release CCB ingestions require 24-hour monitored observation.

2. **Using calcium alone and not starting high-dose insulin early.** Calcium transiently improves hemodynamics but does not address myocardial energy failure — the central mechanism of CCB cardiogenic shock. HDI is the most evidence-supported intervention for myocardial inotropy in CCB toxicity. Start HDI simultaneously with calcium, not as a rescue after calcium fails.

3. **Underdosing HDI.** Doses of 0.1-0.5 units/kg/hr are insufficient. The evidence-supported starting dose is 1 unit/kg/hr with reports of benefit at 5-10 units/kg/hr in refractory toxicity. Aggressive glucose monitoring and supplementation is required, but hypoglycemia is manageable — undertreating cardiogenic shock is not.

4. **Failing to treat hyperglycemia as a toxidrome clue.** A bradycardic, hypotensive patient with a blood glucose of 300 mg/dL and no diabetes history has CCB toxicity until proven otherwise. Hyperglycemia + bradycardia = CCB overdose.

5. **Not anticipating the need for ECMO until arrest.** Mechanical circulatory support is far more effective as a bridge to recovery than as a rescue from full cardiac arrest. Contact your ECMO center when the patient is deteriorating on maximal pharmacologic therapy — not after you've lost pulses.
