# Boerhaave Syndrome

## Recognition

**Mackler Triad (classic but uncommon — present in < 50% of cases):**
1. Vomiting or retching
2. Lower thoracic/epigastric pain
3. Subcutaneous emphysema

**Presentation:**
- Severe retrosternal or epigastric pain following forceful vomiting, retching, or straining
- Pain radiates to back, left shoulder, or left chest
- Dyspnea, tachypnea (mediastinal air, pleural effusion)
- Rapid clinical deterioration to sepsis and shock
- Subcutaneous emphysema (neck, chest wall) — pathognomonic but late finding
- Hamman sign: mediastinal crunch on auscultation (crunching sound synchronous with heartbeat)

**Common precipitants:**
- Forceful/prolonged vomiting (alcohol binge most common)
- Straining (heavy lifting, seizures, childbirth)
- Iatrogenic (endoscopy, dilation, TEE — technically not Boerhaave but same management)

**Typical perforation location:**
- Left posterolateral distal esophagus (90%) — weakest point, 3-6 cm above GEJ
- Communicates with left pleural space → left-sided pleural effusion

## Critical Actions

1. **NPO immediately** — nothing by mouth, NG tube to suction (gentle placement)
2. **Aggressive IV crystalloid resuscitation** — 2 L bolus, target MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
3. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics immediately:**
   - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h PLUS fluconazole 400 mg IV daily
   - OR meropenem 1 g IV q8h PLUS fluconazole 400 mg IV daily
   - Antifungal coverage mandatory (esophageal flora includes Candida)
4. **CT chest/abdomen with oral water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin)** — confirms diagnosis and localizes perforation
5. **Emergent thoracic surgery consultation** — do not delay
6. **IV PPI:** pantoprazole 80 mg IV bolus then 8 mg/hr infusion
7. **Type and crossmatch 2-4 units PRBCs**
8. **Chest tube placement** for large pleural effusion/hydropneumothorax — send fluid for amylase (elevated confirms esophageal communication)

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute MI/ACS** — ECG changes, troponin elevation; pain typically not post-emetic
- **Aortic dissection** — tearing pain, blood pressure differential between arms, widened mediastinum; CTA diagnostic
- **Mallory-Weiss tear** — hematemesis without systemic toxicity, no mediastinal air, mucosal tear only
- **Perforated peptic ulcer** — pneumoperitoneum, not pneumomediastinum; epigastric tenderness
- **Acute pancreatitis** — elevated lipase, epigastric pain radiating to back, no mediastinal air
- **Pulmonary embolism** — dyspnea, pleuritic pain, tachycardia, D-dimer elevation; CTA shows filling defect
- **Tension pneumothorax** — absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation, hypotension
- **Empyema** — fever, unilateral effusion, but usually subacute onset

## Workup

- **CT chest/abdomen/pelvis with IV AND oral water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin):**
  - Gold standard (sensitivity > 95%)
  - Extraluminal contrast leak at perforation site
  - Pneumomediastinum, mediastinal fluid
  - Left pleural effusion/hydropneumothorax
  - Periesophageal fluid/stranding
- **Chest X-ray:**
  - Pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema
  - Left-sided pleural effusion (90%)
  - Widened mediastinum
  - V-sign of Naclerio (V-shaped lucency along mediastinum)
  - May be normal in first few hours
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, lactate, coagulation studies, lipase (exclude pancreatitis), blood cultures, type and crossmatch
- **Pleural fluid analysis:** elevated amylase/salivary amylase, low pH, food particles, polymicrobial gram stain
- **Esophagography with water-soluble contrast** if CT unavailable — barium is contraindicated (causes mediastinitis)
- **Do NOT perform endoscopy** for diagnosis — risk of extending perforation; reserve for therapeutic stent placement only

## Treatment

**Non-operative management (Cameron criteria — highly selected patients):**
- Criteria: contained perforation on imaging, no systemic sepsis, drain into esophagus (not pleural space), minimal symptoms
- NPO, NG decompression, IV antibiotics + antifungals, IV PPI
- TPN for nutritional support
- Serial imaging q24-48h to confirm containment
- Failure of improvement at 24-48h → surgery

**Surgical management (majority of patients — gold standard within 24 hours):**
- Primary repair + reinforcement with tissue flap (intercostal muscle, pleural, diaphragmatic, omental)
- Wide drainage of mediastinum and pleural space
- Approach: left thoracotomy (most common), video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) in select cases
- If delayed (> 24 hours) or tissue friable: T-tube drainage, esophageal diversion, or esophagectomy

**Endoscopic management (evolving role):**
- Self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) or self-expanding plastic stent
- Endoscopic vacuum therapy (E-VAC/Endo-SPONGE) — emerging evidence
- Combined with percutaneous/thoracoscopic drainage
- Best for small, early perforations without frank sepsis

**Supportive care:**
- ICU admission, continuous monitoring
- Vasopressors (norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min) for refractory hypotension
- TPN via central line
- Chest tube(s) for pleural drainage
- Serial lactate, white count monitoring

## Disposition

- **ICU admission mandatory** — all patients with confirmed Boerhaave syndrome
- **Thoracic surgery co-management** from diagnosis
- **Transfer** to center with thoracic surgery capability if not available locally — do not delay for imaging, stabilize and transfer
- **Never discharge** — mortality without treatment approaches 100%
- **Post-operative:** continue IV antibiotics 7-14 days, NPO until contrast swallow study confirms sealed repair (typically day 5-7)

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosis as acute MI or PE.** Boerhaave syndrome mimics acute coronary syndrome and pulmonary embolism. The combination of post-emetic severe chest pain + left pleural effusion should trigger evaluation for esophageal perforation.

2. **Mortality doubles with each 12-hour delay in diagnosis.** Mortality is < 10% with treatment within 12 hours, > 50% at 24 hours, and > 90% at 48 hours. High index of suspicion is the only way to avoid delay.

3. **Confusing Mallory-Weiss with Boerhaave.** Mallory-Weiss is a mucosal tear; Boerhaave is transmural perforation. Subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion differentiates the two. Any concerning finding mandates CT with oral contrast.

4. **Using barium for contrast study.** Barium causes severe mediastinitis and chemical peritonitis. Use ONLY water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin). If water-soluble study is negative but suspicion remains high, thin barium may be used per WSES guidelines (higher sensitivity).

5. **Normal chest X-ray excluding the diagnosis.** CXR may be normal in the first 6 hours. If clinical suspicion is high, proceed to CT with oral contrast regardless of X-ray findings.

6. **Failing to add antifungal coverage.** Esophageal perforation introduces oropharyngeal and esophageal flora including Candida into the mediastinum. Antifungal coverage (fluconazole) is standard in addition to broad-spectrum antibacterials.
