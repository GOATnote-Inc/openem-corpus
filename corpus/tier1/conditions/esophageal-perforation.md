# Esophageal Perforation

## Recognition

**Definition:** Full-thickness disruption of the esophageal wall. Iatrogenic (post-EGD, dilation, TEE) is the most common cause (60%). Boerhaave syndrome (spontaneous perforation from forceful vomiting) is the most lethal subtype. Mortality exceeds 40% when diagnosis is delayed >24 hours.

### Etiologies
- **Iatrogenic (most common):** EGD, esophageal dilation, stent placement, TEE, difficult intubation
- **Spontaneous (Boerhaave):** Forceful vomiting or retching, typically left distal esophagus. Associated with heavy alcohol use, bulimia, severe retching.
- **Traumatic:** Penetrating neck/chest trauma, foreign body ingestion, caustic ingestion
- **Other:** Esophageal cancer with necrosis, pill esophagitis erosion

### Classic Presentation — Mackler Triad (Boerhaave)
- Vomiting (or forceful retching)
- Chest pain (severe, left-sided, pleuritic)
- Subcutaneous emphysema (neck, chest wall crepitus)

Full triad present in <50% of cases. Most common presentation: sudden chest or epigastric pain after vomiting.

### Additional Findings
- Tachycardia, tachypnea, fever
- Hamman sign (mediastinal crunch — crepitation synchronous with heartbeat on auscultation)
- Left pleural effusion (esophageal contents drain into left chest)
- Sepsis, hemodynamic instability (late)
- Odynophagia, dysphagia
- Back pain (posterior mediastinal contamination)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Maintain high clinical suspicion | Any post-emetic chest pain or post-procedure chest/epigastric pain |
| NPO immediately | On suspicion — zero oral intake |
| CT chest/abdomen with oral water-soluble contrast | Urgent diagnostic study |
| Broad-spectrum antibiotics | Within 1 hour |
| Thoracic surgery consultation | Immediate |
| GI consultation | Immediate (for potential endoscopic intervention) |
| Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation | Correct hypovolemia from third-spacing and sepsis |

1. Establish NPO status immediately on suspicion
2. Two large-bore IV lines, aggressive crystalloid resuscitation
3. Obtain CT chest and abdomen with oral water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin)
4. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal coverage
5. Consult thoracic surgery and GI simultaneously
6. Place nasogastric tube only under surgical guidance (risk of extending perforation)
7. Manage sepsis per standard sepsis protocol

## Differential Diagnosis

- Acute myocardial infarction (ECG changes, troponin; no subcutaneous emphysema)
- Aortic dissection (tearing pain, pulse differential, widened mediastinum)
- Pulmonary embolism (pleuritic pain, hypoxia, risk factors for VTE)
- Perforated peptic ulcer (free air under diaphragm, peritoneal signs, epigastric pain)
- Acute pancreatitis (epigastric pain radiating to back, elevated lipase)
- Mallory-Weiss tear (post-emetic hematemesis, but partial-thickness — no perforation)
- Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (young, thin patients; benign; no esophageal leak on contrast study)
- Tension pneumothorax (hypotension, absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation)
- Mediastinitis from other sources (post-sternotomy, dental infections)

## Workup

- **CT chest and abdomen with oral water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin):** Diagnostic standard — sensitivity 92-100%. Demonstrates extraluminal contrast, pneumomediastinum, pleural effusion, esophageal wall thickening, periesophageal fluid/air. First-line imaging.
- **CXR (upright PA and lateral):** Abnormal in ~90%. Findings: left pleural effusion (70%), pneumomediastinum (60%), subcutaneous emphysema (50%), pneumothorax, widened mediastinum. Normal CXR does not exclude perforation.
- **Water-soluble contrast esophagram (Gastrografin swallow):** 75-90% sensitivity. Use water-soluble contrast first (reduces mediastinal contamination vs barium). If negative and suspicion remains, follow with thin barium (higher sensitivity for small leaks).
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis
- **BMP:** Assess renal function, electrolytes (dehydration from vomiting)
- **Lactate:** Marker of tissue hypoperfusion
- **Blood cultures:** Before antibiotics
- **Pleural fluid analysis (if thoracentesis performed):** Low pH (<6.0), elevated amylase (salivary), food particles — diagnostic of esophageal perforation into pleural space

**Do NOT obtain:** Barium swallow as first-line (barium in mediastinum causes severe inflammatory response). Do NOT place a blind NG tube (risk of extending the perforation).

## Treatment

### Resuscitation
- **IV crystalloid:** Aggressive fluid resuscitation — patients are typically hypovolemic from third-spacing, sepsis, and poor oral intake
- **Vasopressors:** Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min if hypotensive despite fluids
- **NPO:** Absolute — nothing by mouth

### Antibiotics
- **First-line:** Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h PLUS fluconazole 400 mg IV load then 200 mg IV daily
- **Alternative:** Meropenem 1 g IV q8h PLUS fluconazole 400 mg IV load then 200 mg IV daily
- **Rationale:** Broad gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic coverage required. Fungal coverage added because esophageal flora contains Candida species.
- Narrow based on operative cultures.

### Surgical/Endoscopic Management
- **Primary repair (<24 hours from perforation):** Best outcomes; thoracotomy with primary closure and tissue flap reinforcement
- **Delayed presentation (>24 hours):** Endoscopic stent placement, drainage (percutaneous or surgical), decortication if empyema present
- **Contained perforation (no sepsis, minimal contamination):** Non-operative management — NPO, IV antibiotics, CT-guided drainage, serial imaging. Requires close thoracic surgery monitoring.
- **Iatrogenic (recognized immediately):** Endoscopic clip closure or stent placement may be sufficient for small perforations

### Adjuncts
- **Chest tube placement:** For pleural effusion/empyema or pneumothorax (left-sided most common)
- **PPI:** Esomeprazole 40 mg IV q12h — reduces gastric acid reflux into perforation site
- **Pain management:** Parenteral opioids; avoid NSAIDs (renal injury risk in hypovolemic septic patient)

## Disposition

- **ICU:** All patients with esophageal perforation — high mortality condition requiring close hemodynamic and respiratory monitoring
- **OR:** Patients requiring surgical repair (most within 24 hours of diagnosis)
- **Transfer:** If thoracic surgery not available, emergent transfer to a center with thoracic surgical capability. Do not delay antibiotics and resuscitation for transfer.
- **Never discharge from ED.** Esophageal perforation is universally fatal without treatment.

## Pitfalls

1. **Anchoring on ACS or PE in a post-emetic patient with chest pain.** Chest pain after vomiting or retching must prompt evaluation for esophageal perforation. Obtain CXR looking for pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema before assuming a cardiac or pulmonary etiology.

2. **Waiting for the full Mackler triad to be present.** Vomiting, chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema occur together in <50% of cases. Any one element after forceful vomiting warrants CT with oral contrast.

3. **Using barium as the initial contrast agent.** Barium in the mediastinum or pleural space causes severe fibrosis and inflammation. Use water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin) first. Thin barium is used only if Gastrografin study is negative and suspicion persists.

4. **Placing a blind NG or OG tube.** Tube passage can extend the perforation or create a false passage. NG tube placement should occur only under fluoroscopic or endoscopic guidance and at the direction of the surgical team.

5. **Diagnosing Mallory-Weiss tear without excluding Boerhaave.** Mallory-Weiss is a partial-thickness mucosal tear; Boerhaave is full-thickness. Both present with post-emetic symptoms. Hematemesis alone does not exclude perforation — subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, or systemic toxicity mandate further workup.

6. **Delaying antibiotics until surgical consultation arrives.** Mortality increases with each hour of delay. Start empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics (including antifungal coverage) in the ED immediately on suspicion.

7. **Missing iatrogenic perforation after recent endoscopy.** Post-EGD chest pain, neck pain, epigastric pain, fever, or subcutaneous emphysema — even hours to days later — requires CT with oral contrast. Do not attribute to "post-procedure discomfort."

8. **Failing to include antifungal coverage.** The esophagus is colonized with Candida species. Polymicrobial mediastinitis from esophageal perforation requires antifungal therapy in addition to antibacterial agents.

9. **Attributing left pleural effusion to pneumonia.** A new left pleural effusion with pleural fluid pH <6.0 or elevated salivary amylase is pathognomonic for esophageal perforation into the left pleural space. Analyze pleural fluid when etiology is unclear.

10. **Underestimating the time urgency.** Mortality doubles from ~10% to >40% when diagnosis is delayed beyond 24 hours. Esophageal perforation is a surgical emergency with a narrow treatment window.
