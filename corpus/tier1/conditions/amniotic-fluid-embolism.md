# Amniotic Fluid Embolism

## Recognition

**Definition:** Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a catastrophic obstetric syndrome caused by entry of amniotic fluid, fetal cells, or debris into the maternal circulation, triggering an anaphylactoid-like reaction with cardiovascular collapse, respiratory failure, and DIC. The pathophysiology is immunologically mediated, not mechanically obstructive — the name is a misnomer that has persisted historically.

**Classic Triad:**
1. Sudden cardiovascular collapse (hypotension, cardiac arrest)
2. Acute respiratory distress (hypoxia, pulmonary edema)
3. DIC (coagulopathy, hemorrhage)

**Timing:**
- 70% occur during active labor
- 19% during cesarean section
- 11% within 30 minutes postpartum
- Rare cases during amniocentesis, pregnancy termination (second trimester), abdominal trauma

**Presenting Signs and Symptoms:**

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Acute hypotension** | Sudden, profound; may precede or accompany respiratory symptoms |
| **Respiratory distress / hypoxia** | Acute onset; oxygen saturation drops precipitously |
| **Altered mental status** | Agitation, confusion, seizure (in up to 50% of cases) |
| **Cardiac arrest** | PEA most common initial rhythm; VF less common |
| **Coagulopathy / hemorrhage** | DIC developing within minutes of cardiovascular collapse; uterine atony with massive hemorrhage |
| **Fetal bradycardia** | Abrupt loss of variability, late decelerations, or terminal bradycardia |
| **Cyanosis** | Rapid progression from onset |

**Diagnostic Criteria (SMFM 2016):**
AFE is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion. No bedside confirmatory test exists in real time. Diagnosis requires:
1. Acute hypotension or cardiac arrest
2. Acute hypoxia (dyspnea, cyanosis, SpO2 <90%)
3. Coagulopathy or severe hemorrhage without another explanation
4. Onset during labor, C-section, dilation and evacuation, or within 30 min postpartum
5. No other condition explains the findings

**Epidemiology:**
- Incidence: 1.9–6.1 per 100,000 deliveries
- Maternal mortality: 20–60%
- Neurological morbidity in 7–50% of survivors
- Fetal survival: ~70% if delivered rapidly; neurological impairment common

## Critical Actions

1. **Call a code — activate the obstetric emergency team immediately.** OB, anesthesia, neonatology, blood bank, critical care. This is a maternal code situation. Do not delay resuscitation to gather history.

2. **Aggressive airway management.** Endotracheal intubation for any patient with respiratory failure or altered mental status. 100% FiO2. PEEP for pulmonary edema. Prepare for difficult airway (pregnancy physiology: full stomach, reduced FRC, edematous airway).

3. **Two large-bore IVs (16-gauge or larger) and arterial line.** Central venous access if peripheral access inadequate. Draw: CBC, type and crossmatch (6 units pRBC + 6 FFP), PT/INR/PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, BMP, troponin, ABG.

4. **Vasopressors for refractory hypotension.** Norepinephrine 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min IV infusion is first-line. Phenylephrine 50–100 mcg IV bolus as bridge. Epinephrine for cardiac arrest per ACLS.

5. **Massive transfusion protocol immediately upon coagulopathy.** Target 1:1:1 ratio (pRBC:FFP:platelets). Cryoprecipitate 10 units IV for fibrinogen <200 mg/dL. Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 minutes (give within 3 hours of hemorrhage onset). Calcium gluconate 1–2 g IV for every 4 units blood products transfused.

6. **ACLS per standard protocol for cardiac arrest.** Perimortem cesarean delivery within 4–5 minutes of cardiac arrest onset — this is a resuscitative procedure that improves maternal cardiac output by relieving aortocaval compression. Do not transfer to OR; perform at bedside.

7. **Right heart failure management.** AFE causes left heart failure first, then right heart failure. Avoid fluid overload. Use vasopressors preferentially. Inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol for refractory pulmonary hypertension if available.

8. **Treat DIC aggressively.** Goal fibrinogen >200 mg/dL, platelets >50,000, INR <1.5. Serial labs every 30–60 minutes until stable. Recombinant factor VIIa 90 mcg/kg IV as rescue for refractory coagulopathy.

9. **Bedside echocardiography** if immediately available — distinguishes left vs. right heart failure pattern, guides vasopressor selection, differentiates from massive PE.

10. **Neonatal resuscitation team at bedside.** If fetus not yet delivered, immediate cesarean is indicated for fetal compromise — neonatology must be present at delivery.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Pulmonary embolism** | Right heart failure predominates (dilated RV, D-sign on echo); onset usually not during delivery; less rapid DIC; no fetal compromise unless maternal arrest |
| **Placental abruption** | Painful uterine bleeding, board-like abdomen; coagulopathy develops more slowly; cardiovascular collapse secondary to hemorrhage, not primary |
| **Eclampsia** | Seizure with hypertension, proteinuria, no DIC as primary feature; prodrome often present |
| **Peripartum cardiomyopathy** | Slower onset; EF reduced on echo; no acute DIC; no sudden collapse during labor |
| **Anaphylaxis** | Urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm; precipitated by identifiable allergen (latex, antibiotic, oxytocin); no DIC; responds to epinephrine |
| **Septic shock** | Fever, source of infection; slower hemodynamic decline; no DIC as immediate presenting feature |
| **Hemorrhagic shock from atony/laceration** | Bleeding source identified; cardiovascular collapse proportional to blood loss; no acute pulmonary failure as primary feature |
| **Air embolism** | History of IV placement or uterine manipulation; "mill wheel" murmur; right heart air on echo |

## Workup

**Simultaneous with resuscitation — do not delay treatment for results:**
- CBC with differential
- Comprehensive metabolic panel
- Coagulation panel: PT, INR, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, thromboelastography (TEG) or ROTEM if available
- Type and crossmatch (6 pRBC, 6 FFP minimum)
- Troponin I or T
- ABG (assess oxygenation, acidosis, lactate)
- 12-lead ECG (rule out myocardial infarction, assess rhythm)

**Imaging:**
- Bedside echocardiography: LV dysfunction with dilated LA/LV (left heart failure pattern), distinguish from PE (RV dilation), assess for pericardial effusion
- CXR: bilateral pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly
- CT-PA: contraindicated in hemodynamic instability; rarely feasible in acute AFE

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous pulse oximetry, capnography, arterial line for beat-to-beat BP
- CVP or PA catheter in ICU for ongoing hemodynamic management
- Serial coagulation labs every 30–60 min until DIC resolving

**Postmortem Diagnosis:**
- Fetal squamous cells and debris in pulmonary vasculature on histology — specific only in context of clinical presentation (fetal squamous cells found incidentally in parturients without AFE)

## Treatment

**Airway and Breathing:**
- Endotracheal intubation with RSI: succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IV (use rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg IV if succinylcholine contraindicated)
- Ketamine 1–2 mg/kg IV for induction (maintains BP; avoid propofol in hypotension)
- Mechanical ventilation: low tidal volume strategy 6 mL/kg IBW, PEEP 5–10 cmH2O, FiO2 to maintain SpO2 >95%

**Cardiovascular — Left Heart Failure:**
- Norepinephrine 0.1–0.3 mcg/kg/min IV infusion (first-line vasopressor)
- Dobutamine 5–15 mcg/kg/min IV if cardiogenic shock with reduced cardiac output confirmed on echo
- Avoid aggressive fluid resuscitation — worsens pulmonary edema

**Cardiovascular — Cardiac Arrest:**
- ACLS per standard protocol
- Perimortem cesarean delivery within 4–5 minutes of arrest onset (performed at bedside — do not wait for OR)
- Consider cardiopulmonary bypass or ECMO at centers with capability

**DIC / Hemorrhage:**
- Massive transfusion protocol: 1:1:1 (pRBC:FFP:platelets)
- Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 min (give within 3 hours of bleeding onset; repeat 1 g if bleeding continues at 30 min)
- Cryoprecipitate 10 units IV: target fibrinogen >200 mg/dL
- Calcium gluconate 1–2 g IV per 4 units blood products transfused
- Recombinant factor VIIa 90 mcg/kg IV for refractory coagulopathy unresponsive to component therapy
- Platelet transfusion: target >50,000 in active bleeding, >100,000 in CNS involvement

**Uterine Atony:**
- Oxytocin 10–40 units in 1 L NS IV infusion (do not give as IV push — hypotension)
- Methylergonovine 0.2 mg IM (contraindicated in hypertension)
- Carboprost 0.25 mg IM q15–90 min (contraindicated in asthma)
- Misoprostol 800–1000 mcg PR if other uterotonics unavailable
- Intrauterine balloon tamponade as bridge to surgical hemostasis
- Hysterectomy for uncontrollable uterine hemorrhage

**Pulmonary Hypertension (refractory):**
- Inhaled nitric oxide 20–40 ppm (reduces RV afterload without systemic hypotension)
- Inhaled epoprostenol 50 ng/kg/min as alternative

## Disposition

**All AFE patients require ICU admission after initial resuscitation.**

**ICU Management:**
- Continuous hemodynamic monitoring (arterial line, CVP or PA catheter)
- Serial coagulation labs and CBC until DIC resolved and hemostasis achieved
- Mechanical ventilation weaning when oxygenation and hemodynamics stable
- Renal replacement therapy for AKI from hypoperfusion
- Neurological monitoring for hypoxic-ischemic injury

**Transfer:**
- If AFE occurs at a facility without ICU, OB anesthesia, or blood bank: initiate resuscitation and arrange emergent transfer. Stabilize airway and hemorrhage before transport. Transport with blood products in transit.

**Fetal/Neonatal:**
- Neonatal ICU admission for all infants delivered during maternal AFE
- Cord blood gas, monitoring for HIE

## Pitfalls

1. **Misidentifying AFE as massive pulmonary embolism.** AFE causes left heart failure first — the initial echo shows LV dysfunction, not RV dilation. PE causes right heart failure with RV dilation and septal shift. Treatment diverges: PE requires anticoagulation/thrombolytics; AFE requires massive transfusion and vasopressors. Bedside echo is the critical differentiating step. Giving anticoagulation to an AFE patient with active DIC is lethal.

2. **Attributing sudden intrapartum collapse to other causes without considering AFE.** AFE can present as seizure (50% of cases), mimicking eclampsia. It can present as sudden respiratory failure, mimicking anaphylaxis or acute heart failure. Any sudden unexplained cardiovascular or respiratory deterioration during or within 30 minutes of delivery is AFE until proven otherwise. The workup and the resuscitation must happen simultaneously.

3. **Delaying perimortem cesarean in cardiac arrest.** Perimortem cesarean must be initiated within 4–5 minutes of cardiac arrest onset to improve maternal resuscitation (aortocaval decompression improves cardiac output 30–40%) and maximize fetal neurological outcome. The cesarean is a maternal resuscitation maneuver — do not wait for fetal viability calculation or OR availability. It is performed at the bedside.

4. **Underestimating DIC severity before overt hemorrhage.** Coagulopathy in AFE may precede visible hemorrhage. A patient who appears hemodynamically stable but has a fibrinogen of 80 mg/dL and INR of 2.5 is about to exsanguinate. Do not wait for clinical bleeding before activating massive transfusion protocol.

5. **Using aggressive IV fluid resuscitation as first-line for hypotension.** AFE hypotension is cardiogenic and vasodilatory — not hypovolemic. Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation worsens pulmonary edema and dilutes coagulation factors. Use vasopressors (norepinephrine) and blood products. Limit crystalloid to <1–2 L before transitioning to vasopressors and MTP.

6. **Attributing coagulopathy entirely to uterine atony and missing the DIC.** Hemorrhage in AFE is driven by DIC, not just uterine atony. Treating only with uterotonics and missing the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate, and platelets leads to exsanguination. Both processes occur simultaneously and require simultaneous treatment.
