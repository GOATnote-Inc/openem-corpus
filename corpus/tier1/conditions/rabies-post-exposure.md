# Rabies Post-Exposure Prophylaxis

## Recognition

**Exposures requiring PEP assessment:**
- Bite wounds from potentially rabid animals (bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes, feral dogs/cats)
- Scratches or open wound contact with saliva from potentially rabid animals
- Bat found in room with sleeping person, unattended child, or intoxicated individual (even without visible bite)
- Mucous membrane exposure to saliva or neural tissue of rabid animal

**High-risk animals (North America):**
- Bats (most common source of human rabies in US)
- Raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes
- Unvaccinated dogs and cats
- Woodchucks

**Low-risk animals (PEP generally NOT needed):**
- Squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, mice, rabbits
- Livestock (assess individually)

**Clinical rabies (if symptomatic — essentially untreatable):**
- Prodrome: fever, malaise, paresthesia/pain at bite site
- Encephalitic form (80%): agitation, hydrophobia, aerophobia, autonomic instability, hallucinations
- Paralytic form (20%): ascending paralysis resembling Guillain-Barre

## Critical Actions

1. **Immediate wound care** — thoroughly wash all wounds with soap and water for minimum 15 minutes; irrigate with povidone-iodine solution
2. **Assess need for PEP** based on animal species, availability for observation/testing, and geographic rabies prevalence
3. **Previously unvaccinated patients:** Administer HRIG + rabies vaccine series
4. **Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) 20 IU/kg:** Infiltrate as much as possible directly into and around the wound; inject remainder IM at site distant from vaccine
5. **Rabies vaccine 1.0 mL IM (deltoid)** on days 0, 3, 7, and 14
6. **Contact local/state health department** for guidance on animal risk assessment and testing

## Differential Diagnosis

- Non-rabid animal bite (wound management only)
- Cat-scratch disease — subacute lymphadenopathy, Bartonella
- Tetanus-prone wound — ensure tetanus prophylaxis regardless
- Cellulitis from bite wound — delayed presentation with erythema, warmth
- Pasteurella multocida infection — rapid-onset cellulitis from cat/dog bite
- Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis — fulminant in asplenic patients

## Workup

- **Wound assessment** — depth, location, contamination, neurovascular status
- **Animal assessment:**
  - Healthy domestic dog/cat: can be observed for 10 days; begin PEP only if animal develops symptoms
  - Wild animal captured: submit brain for rabies testing (direct fluorescent antibody)
  - Bat or high-risk animal not captured: assume rabid, begin PEP immediately
- **Tetanus immunization status** — administer Td/Tdap if > 5 years since last booster
- **No human diagnostic test is useful pre-symptom** — rabies testing of the patient is NOT indicated unless symptomatic

## Treatment

### Wound Care
- Irrigate thoroughly with soap and water (minimum 15 minutes)
- Irrigate with povidone-iodine or virucidal solution
- Debride devitalized tissue
- Delayed primary closure preferred for bite wounds (primary closure only for cosmetic areas — face)
- Avoid suturing wound closed if possible (sutures may trap virus)

### PEP — Previously Unvaccinated
- **HRIG 20 IU/kg** — infiltrate maximum volume into and around wound(s); inject remainder IM at anatomic site distant from vaccine
- **HRIG is given ONCE, on day 0 only.** Do NOT administer after day 7.
- **Rabies vaccine (HDCV or PCECV) 1.0 mL IM (deltoid in adults, anterolateral thigh in children):**
  - Day 0 (as soon as possible)
  - Day 3
  - Day 7
  - Day 14
- **Immunocompromised patients:** Add 5th dose on day 28; check rabies antibody titer at day 14

### PEP — Previously Vaccinated
- **No HRIG**
- **Rabies vaccine 1.0 mL IM** on day 0 and day 3 only (2-dose series)

### Bite Wound Antibiotics (Prophylaxis)
- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg PO BID x 3-5 days** for moderate-to-severe bite wounds
- **Alternative (penicillin allergy):** Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID + metronidazole 500 mg PO TID
- Dog/cat bites to hand, face, or over joint always warrant prophylaxis

## Disposition

- **Most patients discharge** after wound care, HRIG administration, first vaccine dose, and clear instructions for completing the series
- **Admit if:** Extensive wounds requiring operative repair, signs of systemic infection, facial bite wounds in children requiring sedation for wound care
- **Provide written schedule** for remaining vaccine doses (days 3, 7, 14)
- **Arrange follow-up** with primary care or health department for subsequent doses
- **Reportable:** Suspected rabies exposure is reportable to local/state health department. Animal bites are reportable in most jurisdictions.

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing bat exposure without visible bite.** Bat bites can be imperceptible (tiny teeth). Any bat found in a room with a sleeping person, unattended child, or intoxicated individual is an indication for PEP.

2. **Administering HRIG and vaccine at the same anatomic site.** HRIG neutralizes vaccine antigen. They must be given at different anatomic sites.

3. **Omitting HRIG.** HRIG provides immediate passive immunity during the 7-14 days before the vaccine generates an active immune response. Omitting HRIG in a previously unvaccinated patient may be fatal.

4. **Giving HRIG to previously vaccinated patients.** Previously vaccinated patients already have memory B cells. HRIG is unnecessary and may blunt the anamnestic response.

5. **Delaying PEP while waiting for animal testing results.** If the animal is unavailable for testing (especially bats, wild carnivores), begin PEP immediately. It can always be discontinued if the animal tests negative.

6. **Not infiltrating HRIG into the wound.** The maximum possible volume should be infiltrated directly into and around the wound(s). Systemic IM injection alone is insufficient.

7. **Suturing bite wounds tightly.** Primary closure traps bacteria and viral inoculum. Leave wounds open or use loose approximation. Exception: facial wounds where cosmesis is critical (irrigate thoroughly first).
