# Sigmoid Volvulus

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Gradual onset abdominal pain, distension, and constipation (triad)
- Massive abdominal distension (often dramatic)
- Obstipation — inability to pass flatus or stool
- Nausea, vomiting (late finding)
- Recurrent episodes in 40-60% of patients (history of prior volvulus)
- Typically elderly (> 60 years), institutionalized, neuropsychiatric patients (Parkinson disease, schizophrenia), bedridden patients

**Risk factors:**
- Chronic constipation with redundant sigmoid colon
- High-fiber diet (endemic in Africa, Middle East, South America)
- Neuropsychiatric conditions, chronic anticholinergic use
- Pregnancy (third trimester)
- Chagas disease (megacolon)

**Exam findings:**
- Massive asymmetric abdominal distension
- Tympanic percussion
- Empty rectum on DRE
- Peritoneal signs (guarding, rebound) indicate gangrene or perforation — emergent surgery

## Critical Actions

1. **IV fluid resuscitation** — isotonic crystalloid, correct dehydration
2. **NPO, nasogastric tube** if vomiting
3. **Abdominal X-ray** — identify classic coffee-bean sign
4. **If NO signs of peritonitis, gangrene, or perforation:** flexible sigmoidoscopy for decompression
5. **If peritoneal signs present:** emergent surgical consultation — proceed to OR
6. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics if sepsis suspected:** piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h
7. **Place rectal decompression tube** after successful endoscopic detorsion (leave in place 48-72 hours)
8. **Surgical consultation for definitive management** (elective sigmoid colectomy)

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Cecal volvulus** — younger patients, right-sided distension, coffee-bean pointing to LUQ; endoscopic decompression rarely successful (10-15%)
- **Ogilvie syndrome (ACPO)** — no transition point, postoperative/critically ill patient, diffuse colonic dilation
- **Mechanical large bowel obstruction (tumor)** — CT shows mass at transition point, older patients with weight loss
- **Toxic megacolon** — systemic toxicity, diarrhea/bloody stool history, inflammatory colitis
- **Small bowel obstruction** — central dilated loops with air-fluid levels, decompressed colon

## Workup

- **Abdominal X-ray (first-line):**
  - Coffee-bean sign (inverted U-shaped dilated loop arising from pelvis)
  - Apex points toward RUQ
  - Loss of haustral markings in dilated segment
  - Absent rectal gas
  - Sensitivity 60-75%
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (when diagnosis uncertain):**
  - Bird-beak sign at point of torsion
  - Whirl sign (mesenteric swirl at torsion point)
  - Assess bowel wall enhancement (lack of enhancement = ischemia)
  - Pneumatosis, portal venous gas indicate gangrene
  - Sensitivity > 95%
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP, lactate, coagulation studies, type and screen
- **Water-soluble contrast enema:** bird-beak deformity at rectosigmoid junction (if CT unavailable)

## Treatment

**Endoscopic decompression (first-line for uncomplicated):**
- Flexible sigmoidoscopy with gentle advancement past point of torsion
- Successful in > 85-90% of non-gangrenous cases
- Visible dark/necrotic mucosa → stop procedure, proceed to surgery
- Place rectal decompression tube (24-26 Fr) past torsion point, leave in place 48-72 hours
- Bowel preparation with polyethylene glycol via tube to prevent early recurrence
- Recurrence rate without subsequent colectomy: 40-60%

**Surgical management:**
- **Emergent surgery indications:**
  - Peritonitis or suspected bowel gangrene
  - Failed endoscopic decompression
  - Perforation (free air)
  - Hemodynamic instability
- **Procedure:** sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy (Hartmann procedure) if gangrenous; primary anastomosis if viable bowel and patient stable
- **Elective sigmoid colectomy:** recommended after successful endoscopic decompression during same admission or within 2-4 weeks to prevent recurrence
- Laparoscopic approach preferred in elective setting

**Supportive care:**
- IV crystalloid resuscitation
- Electrolyte correction (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia)
- Antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h if peritonitis/sepsis
- DVT prophylaxis

## Disposition

- **Admit all patients** — even after successful endoscopic decompression
- **ICU:** peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, post-emergent colectomy
- **Surgical ward:** post-elective colectomy, stable post-decompression patients
- **Rectal tube monitoring** — check position q12h, irrigate to maintain patency
- **Surgical follow-up** for elective colectomy if decompression successful and surgery deferred
- **Discharge** only after documented bowel function, tolerating diet, and plan for definitive surgery in place

## Pitfalls

1. **Attempting endoscopic decompression when peritoneal signs are present.** If the patient has guarding, rebound, or signs of perforation/gangrene, endoscopy is contraindicated. Proceed directly to surgery.

2. **Successful decompression without plan for definitive surgery.** Recurrence rate is 40-60% without colectomy. Every patient must be referred for sigmoid colectomy.

3. **Confusing sigmoid volvulus with cecal volvulus.** Cecal volvulus has much lower success rates with endoscopic decompression (10-15%) and typically requires surgical management. CT distinguishes the two.

4. **Missing gangrenous bowel during endoscopy.** Dark, dusky, or necrotic-appearing mucosa during sigmoidoscopy mandates immediate termination of the procedure and emergent surgery.

5. **Premature removal of rectal decompression tube.** The tube should remain 48-72 hours to prevent early re-volvulus. Document tube position and irrigate regularly.

6. **Failing to identify underlying Chagas disease or neuropsychiatric contributors.** Recurrent volvulus in younger patients from endemic areas warrants Chagas testing. Anticholinergic medication review is essential.
