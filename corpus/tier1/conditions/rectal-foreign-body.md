# Rectal Foreign Body

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Rectal pain, sensation of fullness, tenesmus
- Rectal bleeding (if mucosal injury)
- Inability to pass the object spontaneously
- Delayed presentation (embarrassment; patients may wait hours to days)
- Abdominal pain, distension, vomiting if obstruction develops
- Peritoneal signs if perforation has occurred

**History considerations:**
- Obtain history in private, non-judgmental manner
- Ask about type, size, shape, and material of object
- Duration of retention
- Prior attempts at self-removal
- Any ingested foreign bodies (body packing — different management)
- Signs/symptoms of perforation: fever, severe pain, rigidity

**Exam findings:**
- Abdominal exam: distension, tenderness (peritoneal signs suggest perforation)
- DRE: palpable object (low-lying), blood, sphincter tone assessment
- Assess for signs of trauma: anal lacerations, mucosal tears, bleeding
- Object may not be palpable on DRE if high-lying (above rectosigmoid junction)

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess for perforation** — peritoneal signs, free air on imaging = emergent surgery
2. **Abdominal X-ray (AP and lateral)** — confirm location, number, and type of object; assess for free air
3. **If peritonitis or free air:** emergent surgical consultation, NPO, broad-spectrum antibiotics
4. **If no perforation and object palpable on DRE:** attempt bedside transanal extraction under procedural sedation
5. **Procedural sedation:** midazolam 2-4 mg IV + fentanyl 50-100 mcg IV, or ketamine 1 mg/kg IV
6. **Local anesthesia:** perianal block with lidocaine 1% (10-20 mL) for sphincter relaxation
7. **Post-extraction:** rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy to assess for mucosal injury, then repeat abdominal X-ray
8. **Surgical consultation** if bedside extraction fails or object is above rectosigmoid junction

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Rectal prolapse** — protruding rectal mucosa, concentric rings; no foreign body history
- **Perianal abscess** — fluctuant perianal mass, fever, pain; no foreign body
- **Rectal tumor** — chronic symptoms, weight loss, iron deficiency; mass on DRE
- **Fecal impaction** — hard stool on DRE, chronic constipation
- **Body packing (drug smuggling)** — multiple small packages on X-ray; DO NOT attempt manual extraction (rupture risk → fatal overdose); surgical/endoscopic removal
- **Intussusception** — abdominal pain, bloody stool, target sign on imaging

## Workup

- **Abdominal X-ray (AP and lateral):** confirm foreign body location, size, number; assess for pneumoperitoneum
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** if perforation suspected (free air, free fluid), or if object not visible on X-ray
- **Labs:** CBC, BMP (if peritonitis suspected), lactate, type and screen (if surgery anticipated)
- **DRE:** determine distance from anal verge, assess sphincter tone, palpate object if within reach
- **Post-extraction imaging:** repeat X-ray to confirm complete removal and exclude perforation

## Treatment

**Bedside transanal extraction (first-line for low-lying objects < 10 cm from anal verge):**
- Positioning: lithotomy or left lateral decubitus
- Procedural sedation + local perianal block (10-20 mL lidocaine 1%)
- Lubricate generously with water-soluble lubricant
- Techniques:
  - Direct grasping with ringed or Kocher forceps (hard objects)
  - Foley catheter technique: pass catheter beyond object, inflate balloon with 30 mL saline, apply gentle traction to disengage suction effect
  - Vacuum-break technique: pass catheter alongside object to release negative pressure above it
  - Obstetric vacuum extractor for smooth spherical objects
- Apply gentle bimanual suprapubic pressure to advance object distally
- Success rate: 60-75% with adequate sedation and technique

**Endoscopic extraction:**
- For objects beyond reach of digital exam but within sigmoid colon
- Performed under conscious sedation in endoscopy suite
- Snare, basket, or grasping forceps through flexible sigmoidoscope
- Minimize insufflation (CO2 preferred)

**Surgical extraction:**
- Indications: failed transanal and endoscopic attempts, perforation, peritonitis, high-lying objects
- Laparotomy or laparoscopic-assisted: milking object distally for transanal extraction
- If perforation: segmental resection with primary anastomosis or diversion (Hartmann procedure)

**Post-extraction care:**
- Rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy to inspect for mucosal tears, rectal wall injury
- Repeat abdominal X-ray to exclude retained fragments and pneumoperitoneum
- Observe 4-6 hours for signs of delayed perforation (pain, fever, peritonitis)
- Prescribe stool softener: docusate 100 mg PO BID
- Warm sitz baths for perianal discomfort

## Disposition

- **Discharge (majority after successful extraction):**
  - Post-extraction endoscopy shows no significant injury
  - Post-extraction X-ray negative for perforation
  - Pain controlled, tolerating PO
  - Observation period (4-6 hours) uneventful
  - Return precautions: fever, severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, inability to have bowel movement
- **Admit:** perforation, significant rectal injury requiring observation, failed extraction requiring operative intervention, concern for delayed perforation
- **ICU:** perforation with peritonitis, sepsis, post-operative monitoring

## Pitfalls

1. **Attempting extraction of body-packing materials.** Drug-filled packets can rupture during extraction, causing fatal overdose (cocaine, opioids). Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol is first-line. Surgical removal if obstruction, signs of toxicity, or failure to pass.

2. **Missing rectal perforation post-extraction.** Always perform sigmoidoscopy and repeat X-ray after extraction. Delayed perforation can occur from pressure necrosis or extraction trauma. Observe 4-6 hours minimum.

3. **Inadequate sedation or anesthesia leading to sphincter spasm.** Attempting extraction without adequate sedation causes pain, sphincter spasm, and failed removal. Procedural sedation with perianal nerve block dramatically improves success rates.

4. **Not addressing the suction effect.** Negative pressure above a smooth object in the rectum makes extraction impossible with traction alone. Break the vacuum seal by passing a catheter alongside the object before attempting removal.

5. **Judgmental attitude delaying care.** Patients with rectal foreign bodies frequently delay presentation due to embarrassment. A non-judgmental clinical approach facilitates accurate history and timely management.

6. **Failing to consider abuse or assault.** In all cases, particularly pediatric or vulnerable patients, screen for sexual assault. Involve social work and follow mandatory reporting requirements when indicated.
