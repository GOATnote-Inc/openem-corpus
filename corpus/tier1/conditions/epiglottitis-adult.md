# Adult Epiglottitis

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Severe sore throat disproportionate to pharyngeal findings
- Muffled "hot potato" voice
- Odynophagia, dysphagia, drooling
- Stridor (late finding — indicates critical narrowing)
- Tripod positioning (sitting upright, leaning forward, neck extended)
- Fever, toxic appearance

**Key exam findings:**
- Oropharynx may appear normal — epiglottis is below line of sight on routine exam
- Tender anterior neck, especially at hyoid level
- Cervical lymphadenopathy

**Common etiologies (adults):**
- Haemophilus influenzae (less common post-Hib vaccine era)
- Streptococcus spp. (pneumoniae, pyogenes) — now most common in adults
- Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)
- Viral: HSV, parainfluenza
- Thermal/caustic injury, crack cocaine inhalation

**Red flags for imminent obstruction:**
- Stridor at rest
- Inability to swallow secretions
- Rapidly progressing symptoms (< 12 hours)
- SpO2 declining despite supplemental O2

## Critical Actions

1. **Do NOT agitate the patient** — avoid tongue depressors, blind laryngoscopy, IV starts in uncontrolled settings, or laying patient supine. Any of these can precipitate complete obstruction.
2. **Keep patient upright** — allow position of comfort
3. **Call anesthesia and ENT simultaneously** — double setup for airway management
4. **Prepare for surgical airway** — have cricothyrotomy kit at bedside
5. **Airway management preference:** Awake fiberoptic intubation (100% success rate in meta-analysis). If unavailable, awake video laryngoscopy in OR with surgical backup.
6. **Do NOT perform traditional RSI** — paralysis without visualization risks complete airway loss
7. **Nebulized racemic epinephrine 2.25% 0.5 mL** — temporizing bridge only if stridor present
8. **IV antibiotics after airway secured:** Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV (if MRSA concern)
9. **Dexamethasone 10 mg IV** — reduces edema, may shorten course

## Differential Diagnosis

- Peritonsillar abscess — unilateral swelling, uvular deviation, trismus
- Retropharyngeal abscess — neck stiffness, posterior pharyngeal bulge on lateral neck X-ray
- Ludwig angina — floor of mouth swelling, bilateral submandibular induration
- Angioedema — no fever, often with lip/tongue swelling, history of ACEi or allergy
- Croup (in adults) — rare, barking cough, steeple sign on X-ray
- Foreign body aspiration — acute onset, history of choking event
- Laryngeal cancer — chronic progressive symptoms, hoarseness

## Workup

- **Lateral soft tissue neck X-ray** (if patient stable) — "thumbprint sign" (swollen epiglottis), thickened aryepiglottic folds. Sensitivity ~90%.
- **CT neck with contrast** — definitive if diagnosis uncertain, rules out abscess. Only if airway is stable.
- **Flexible nasopharyngoscopy** — performed by ENT in controlled setting. Direct visualization of cherry-red swollen epiglottis. Gold standard.
- **Do NOT delay airway management for imaging**
- **CBC, blood cultures, throat cultures** — after airway secured
- **Lactate** if sepsis concern

## Treatment

### Antibiotics
- **Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h** (covers H. influenzae, Strep spp.)
- **Add vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h** if MRSA suspected
- **Alternative:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h
- **Duration:** 7-10 days IV, step-down to oral (amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg PO BID) when tolerating PO

### Adjunctive
- Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q8h x 24-48h (reduces mucosal edema)
- Nebulized epinephrine as temporizing measure
- Heliox (70:30 helium:oxygen) — may improve laminar flow if available
- NPO until airway secure and swelling resolving

### Airway Management Rates
- Approximately 10% of adult epiglottitis cases require intubation
- Those with stridor, respiratory distress, or rapid progression are at highest risk

## Disposition

- **All patients:** ICU admission with airway equipment at bedside
- **Intubated patients:** Extubation trial with cuff leak test at 48-72h, with ENT/anesthesia available
- **Non-intubated patients:** ICU or monitored bed for minimum 24h with serial airway assessment
- **Isolation:** Droplet precautions if H. influenzae suspected; standard otherwise
- **Reportable:** H. influenzae type b is reportable to public health

## Pitfalls

1. **Performing traditional RSI.** Paralysis of a patient with a swollen epiglottis risks complete inability to intubate or ventilate. Awake fiberoptic intubation with surgical airway backup is the standard approach.

2. **Laying the patient supine for examination or imaging.** The swollen epiglottis acts as a ball valve — supine positioning can cause complete obstruction. Keep the patient upright.

3. **Dismissing "sore throat" in the toxic-appearing adult with drooling.** Adult epiglottitis is often misdiagnosed as pharyngitis or peritonsillar abscess. Disproportionate pain with minimal pharyngeal findings should trigger suspicion.

4. **Sending the patient to radiology unmonitored.** If imaging is needed, portable lateral neck X-ray at bedside is preferred. Never send an unstable patient to CT without airway equipment and trained personnel.

5. **Delaying antibiotics until culture results.** Empiric broad-spectrum coverage should start immediately after airway is secured. Do not wait for cultures.

6. **Failing to prepare for surgical airway.** Even with fiberoptic capability, cricothyrotomy must be immediately available. Equipment should be opened and at the bedside before any airway manipulation begins.
