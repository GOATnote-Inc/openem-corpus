# Severe Clostridioides difficile Infection

## Recognition

**Severity classification:**
- **Severe CDI:** WBC >= 15,000 cells/mm3 OR serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL (or > 1.5x baseline)
- **Fulminant CDI:** Hypotension, shock, ileus, or megacolon

**Presentation:**
- Profuse watery diarrhea (> 10 stools/day in severe cases)
- Abdominal pain, distension, tenderness
- Fever (often > 38.5°C)
- Nausea, anorexia, malaise
- Fulminant: ileus (paradoxical decrease in diarrhea), toxic megacolon, peritoneal signs

**Risk factors:**
- Recent antibiotic use (especially fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, cephalosporins, carbapenems)
- Hospitalization within 90 days
- Age > 65 years
- Immunosuppression, chemotherapy
- PPI use, inflammatory bowel disease

**Red flags for fulminant disease:**
- WBC > 25,000 or < 2,000 (leukemoid reaction or leukopenia)
- Lactate > 2.2 mmol/L
- Colonic dilation > 6 cm on imaging
- Peritoneal signs, rebound tenderness
- End-organ dysfunction

## Critical Actions

1. **Stop the offending antibiotic** immediately if possible
2. **Stool testing:** C. difficile toxin PCR or GDH + toxin EIA
3. **Start vancomycin PO immediately** for suspected severe CDI — do NOT wait for test results if clinical suspicion is high
4. **For fulminant disease:** Vancomycin PO + vancomycin PR + metronidazole IV (triple therapy)
5. **Surgical consultation early** in fulminant disease — colectomy may be life-saving
6. **Avoid antimotility agents** (loperamide) — risk of toxic megacolon

## Differential Diagnosis

- Inflammatory bowel disease flare (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis)
- Ischemic colitis — bloody stool, watershed distribution
- CMV colitis (immunocompromised) — inclusion bodies on biopsy
- Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (non-CDI) — mild, no systemic toxicity
- Small bowel obstruction — if ileus predominates
- Toxic megacolon from other causes
- Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis) — right lower quadrant, neutropenic patients

## Workup

- **Stool C. difficile testing:**
  - NAAT (PCR) for toxin gene — highly sensitive
  - GDH + toxin A/B EIA — two-step algorithm preferred by some institutions
  - Do NOT test formed stool; do NOT test for cure
- **CBC with differential** — leukocytosis (WBC > 15,000 defines severe; > 25,000 suggests fulminant)
- **BMP** — creatinine elevation (> 1.5x baseline defines severe), electrolytes, bicarbonate
- **Lactate** — elevated in fulminant disease
- **Albumin** — hypoalbuminemia is a poor prognostic marker
- **Abdominal X-ray or CT abdomen/pelvis** — colonic wall thickening, "accordion sign," thumbprinting, free air (perforation), megacolon (> 6 cm transverse colon)
- **Blood cultures** if febrile or hemodynamically unstable

## Treatment

### Severe CDI (Non-Fulminant)
- **Fidaxomicin 200 mg PO BID x 10 days** (preferred — lower recurrence rate)
- **OR Vancomycin 125 mg PO QID x 10 days** (effective alternative)
- Metronidazole is NOT recommended for severe disease

### Fulminant CDI
- **Vancomycin 500 mg PO or via NG tube QID** PLUS
- **Metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h** (reaches colonic lumen via biliary excretion when ileus prevents oral delivery) PLUS
- **Vancomycin 500 mg in 100 mL NS per rectum q6h** (retention enema, if ileus present)

### Surgical Intervention
- **Indications:** Perforation, toxic megacolon not responding to medical therapy, peritonitis, septic shock refractory to medical management, organ failure
- **Procedure:** Subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy (standard); diverting loop ileostomy with colonic vancomycin lavage (alternative, preserves colon)
- **Mortality with colectomy:** 35-50% (but 80-100% without surgery in fulminant refractory disease)

### Recurrent CDI
- First recurrence: Fidaxomicin 200 mg PO BID x 10 days (or extended-pulse regimen)
- Multiple recurrences: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) or bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg IV x 1 dose (anti-toxin B antibody)

### Supportive
- Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation
- Electrolyte repletion (potassium, magnesium)
- Avoid loperamide, opioids
- Contact precautions with soap and water hand hygiene (alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill spores)

## Disposition

- **Severe CDI:** Admit to ward with telemetry; serial abdominal exams and labs
- **Fulminant CDI:** ICU admission with surgical consultation
- **Contact precautions** — private room, gown and gloves, soap and water hand hygiene
- **Reportable:** CDI is reportable to public health in many jurisdictions (per NHSN surveillance)
- **Discharge criteria:** Clinical improvement, tolerating PO, stable labs, completing or transitioning to oral antibiotic course

## Pitfalls

1. **Using metronidazole alone for severe CDI.** IDSA/SHEA 2021 guidelines explicitly recommend against metronidazole for severe disease. Oral vancomycin or fidaxomicin is required.

2. **Failing to add rectal vancomycin in fulminant disease with ileus.** When diarrhea paradoxically decreases, oral vancomycin may not reach the colon. Rectal vancomycin enemas and IV metronidazole are both needed.

3. **Using alcohol-based hand sanitizer.** C. difficile spores are resistant to alcohol. Soap and water handwashing is mandatory.

4. **Delaying surgical consultation in fulminant disease.** Colectomy mortality is 35-50%, but waiting until multi-organ failure develops increases mortality to near 100%. Early surgical consultation is critical.

5. **Testing for C. difficile in asymptomatic patients or as "test of cure."** Toxin PCR can remain positive for weeks after treatment. Testing should only be performed on unformed stool from symptomatic patients.

6. **Prescribing loperamide or opioids to control diarrhea.** Antimotility agents impair toxin clearance and increase risk of toxic megacolon.
