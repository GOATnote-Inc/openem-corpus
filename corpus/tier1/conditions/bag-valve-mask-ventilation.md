# Bag-Valve-Mask Ventilation

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Apnea or inadequate respiratory effort (RR < 8 or > 35 with poor tidal volumes)
- Bridge ventilation during RSI preparation (preoxygenation in the non-breathing patient)
- Cardiac arrest — ventilation component of CPR
- Respiratory failure unresponsive to supplemental oxygen alone
- Post-intubation ventilation during transport or equipment transition
- Any patient requiring positive-pressure ventilation before definitive airway

**Contraindications:**
- None absolute in emergency setting — BVM is a fundamental rescue technique
- Relative: complete upper airway obstruction (foreign body above the glottis) — BVM cannot overcome fixed obstruction; requires removal or surgical airway
- Significant facial trauma with loss of structural integrity for mask seal (relative — attempt, but plan for supraglottic or surgical airway)

**Predictors of Difficult BVM Ventilation (MOANS):**
- **M**ask seal difficulty: beard, facial trauma, edentulous
- **O**besity: BMI > 30
- **A**ge > 55 years
- **N**o teeth (edentulous — loss of structural support)
- **S**noring/sleep apnea, stiff lungs (asthma, COPD, pulmonary fibrosis)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| BVM assembly and connection to O2 | < 15 seconds |
| Adequate mask seal established | < 30 seconds |
| Visible chest rise with each breath | Every ventilation |
| SpO2 response | Uptrend within 30-60 seconds |

1. **Open airway** — head-tilt chin-lift (no trauma) or jaw thrust (trauma/C-spine)
2. **Insert oropharyngeal airway (OPA)** — size: corner of mouth to tragus of ear; or nasopharyngeal airway (NPA) if trismus/clenched jaw
3. **Select mask size** — mask should span from bridge of nose to mentum without covering eyes; size 4-5 for adults
4. **Establish mask seal** — two-person technique preferred
5. **Ventilate** — squeeze bag over 1 second, deliver 500-600 mL (enough for visible chest rise), rate 10-12/min (non-arrest) or 1 breath every 6 seconds with continuous compressions (arrest)
6. **Monitor** — chest rise, SpO2, ETCO2 if available, gastric distension

## Differential Diagnosis

**Alternative Ventilation Methods:**

| Technique | When to Use Over BVM |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Supraglottic airway (iGel, LMA) | Prolonged ventilation, difficult mask seal, hands-free ventilation needed |
| Endotracheal intubation | Definitive airway required; aspiration risk; prolonged ventilation |
| High-flow nasal cannula | Spontaneous breathing present but hypoxic |
| NIV (BiPAP/CPAP) | Spontaneous breathing with respiratory distress (COPD, CHF, asthma) |
| Mouth-to-mask ventilation | No BVM available; prehospital without equipment |
| Surgical airway | Complete upper airway obstruction where BVM fails |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Setup:**

| Equipment | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| BVM | Self-inflating bag (adult 1600 mL); pediatric sizes: infant 500 mL, child 1000 mL |
| O2 connection | 15 L/min via reservoir bag (delivers ~100% FiO2 with reservoir inflated) |
| PEEP valve | 5-10 cmH2O (attach to BVM exhalation port) — improves oxygenation and prevents atelectasis |
| Face mask | Transparent (allows secretion/emesis detection); correct size for patient |
| OPA | Sizes 70-100 mm (adults); select by mouth corner to ear tragus measurement |
| NPA | Sizes 6.0-8.0 (adults); lubricated with water-soluble gel |
| Suction | Yankauer immediately available |
| ETCO2 | In-line capnography adapter if available |
| Nasogastric tube | For decompression if gastric distension develops |

**Patient Positioning:**
- Sniffing position: neck flexed, head extended — aligns oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal axes
- Obese patients: ramped position (towels/blankets under shoulders and head until ear aligns with sternal notch)
- Trauma: neutral position with jaw thrust; maintain C-spine immobilization

## Treatment

### One-Person Technique (EC Clamp)
- Non-dominant hand: thumb and index finger form a "C" pressing the mask to the face; middle, ring, and little fingers form an "E" on the mandible, lifting the jaw into the mask
- Dominant hand: squeezes the bag
- Limitation: poor seal in edentulous, bearded, or obese patients — two-person technique preferred

### Two-Person Technique (Preferred)
- **Operator 1** (at head of bed): both hands on the mask using bilateral jaw thrust grip — thumbs press the mask down on the face; fingers 2-5 of both hands lift the mandible anteriorly (thenar eminence technique)
- **Operator 2:** squeezes the bag with both hands, delivering controlled tidal volumes
- Superior tidal volumes and mask seal compared to one-person technique

### Ventilation Parameters

| Parameter | Adult | Pediatric | Infant |
|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Tidal volume | 500-600 mL (6-7 mL/kg) | 8-10 mL/kg | 5-8 mL/kg |
| Rate (non-arrest) | 10-12/min | 12-20/min | 20-30/min |
| Rate (CPR) | 1 breath every 6 sec (with advanced airway) | Same | Same |
| Inspiratory time | 1 second | 1 second | 1 second |
| O2 flow | 15 L/min | 15 L/min | 10-15 L/min |

### Optimization Strategies

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Air leak around mask | Two-person technique; insert OPA/NPA; reposition; use smaller mask |
| Beard preventing seal | Apply water-soluble lubricant or transparent film dressing over beard |
| Edentulous patient | Leave dentures in if intact; stuff gauze in cheeks for structural support |
| Gastric distension | Reduce tidal volumes; slow inspiratory time; consider cricoid pressure; place NG tube |
| Inability to ventilate despite optimization | Suspect obstruction — suction, direct laryngoscopy to visualize, Magill forceps for FB; proceed to SGA or surgical airway |

### Post-Procedure
- Document duration of BVM ventilation and adequacy of chest rise
- Transition to definitive airway (ETT, SGA) if BVM ventilation will be needed > 5-10 minutes
- Decompress stomach with NG/OG tube if gastric distension present
- Ongoing SpO2 and ETCO2 monitoring

## Disposition

- **BVM as bridge to intubation:** proceed to RSI once team and equipment ready
- **BVM in cardiac arrest:** continue ventilation per ACLS protocol; transition to advanced airway when possible without interrupting compressions
- **BVM as sole ventilation (resource-limited):** patient requires ICU admission for definitive airway management
- **Transfer:** BVM ventilation during transport is acceptable for short transfers; continuous monitoring required

## Pitfalls

1. **Hyperventilation during cardiac arrest.** Excessive ventilation rate (> 10/min) increases intrathoracic pressure, reduces venous return, and decreases coronary perfusion pressure. This is one of the most common and deadly errors in resuscitation. Use a metronome or count "squeeze... two... three... four... five... six" for proper timing.

2. **One-person technique in a patient who requires two-person.** The EC-clamp technique has a 30-40% failure rate for adequate ventilation in obese, edentulous, or bearded patients. Default to two-person technique whenever a second provider is available. The person with the most airway experience should manage the mask, not the bag.

3. **Failure to insert an OPA or NPA before BVM ventilation.** Soft tissue obstruction from the tongue is the most common cause of ineffective BVM ventilation. An oral or nasal airway holds the tongue forward and dramatically improves air exchange. Insert an adjunct before attempting ventilation.

4. **Excessive tidal volumes causing gastric insufflation.** Tidal volumes > 600-700 mL overcome lower esophageal sphincter pressure, insufflating the stomach. Gastric distension impairs diaphragmatic excursion, increases aspiration risk, and leads to vomiting. Deliver just enough volume for visible chest rise — typically 500-600 mL in adults.

5. **Not connecting the reservoir bag to oxygen.** Without the reservoir and 15 L/min O2, a self-inflating BVM delivers only 21% (room air) to ~40% FiO2. In critical patients requiring BVM, 100% FiO2 is needed. Always confirm the reservoir is attached and O2 is flowing before ventilating.

6. **Applying excessive cricoid pressure that occludes the airway.** Sellick maneuver (30 N of cricoid pressure) can compress the esophagus but also distorts the airway, making ventilation harder. If BVM ventilation is inadequate, release cricoid pressure and reassess.
