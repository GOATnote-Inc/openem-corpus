# Foreign Body Aspiration

## Recognition

**Definition:** Inhalation of a solid or liquid material into the larynx, trachea, or bronchi resulting in partial or complete airway obstruction. Most common in children ages 1–3. In adults, peaks in elderly patients and those with neurological impairment.

**Presentation by Obstruction Level:**

| Location | Clinical Features |
|----------|------------------|
| Laryngeal/supraglottic | Dysphonia, aphonia, stridor, croup-like cough, high risk of complete obstruction |
| Tracheal | Biphasic stridor, audible slap/thud on auscultation, high-pitched wheeze, cyanosis |
| Bronchial (most common) | Unilateral wheeze, localized decreased breath sounds, persistent cough; right main bronchus most common site in adults, right or left bronchus equally affected in children |

**Classic Triad (Chevalier Jackson):** Sudden onset cough, wheeze, decreased breath sounds. Present in only 40% of cases; absence does not exclude diagnosis.

**Obstruction Classification:**
- **Complete (high-grade):** Unable to speak, cough, or breathe; silent chest; cyanosis; loss of consciousness. Immediately life-threatening.
- **Partial (low-grade):** Able to cough, vocalize, move air. Cough may be ineffective. Stridor, wheeze, or dyspnea present.

**Risk Factors:**
- Pediatric: Ages 6 months–3 years (developmental oral exploration, incompletely developed swallow coordination), nuts/seeds/grapes/hot dogs/coins as common objects
- Adult: Neurological impairment, sedation, alcohol intoxication, dental procedures, altered mentation, advanced age

**Delayed Presentation:** Foreign body in lower airways for > 24 hours may present as recurrent pneumonia, persistent wheeze, or lung abscess in the same lobe. Consider FBA in any child with recurrent unilateral pulmonary pathology.

## Critical Actions

1. **Distinguish complete from partial obstruction immediately.** Ask "Can you cough/speak?" If yes — do not intervene with physical maneuvers. Encourage forceful coughing. If no — proceed immediately to airway clearance.

2. **Complete obstruction in a conscious adult/child > 1 year:** 5 back blows (heel of hand, interscapular), then 5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver). Alternate until object expelled or patient loses consciousness.

3. **Complete obstruction in infant < 1 year:** 5 back blows (face-down on forearm), then 5 chest thrusts (2 fingers, lower sternum). Do NOT use abdominal thrusts — liver injury risk.

4. **Pregnant or obese patients:** Chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts. Two-hand sternal compression, not subdiaphragmatic.

5. **Unconscious patient:** Begin CPR. At each cycle, look into the mouth before delivering breaths — remove foreign body only if directly visualized. Do NOT perform blind finger sweeps.

6. **Direct laryngoscopy + Magill forceps** if foreign body is visible in hypopharynx/larynx. Attempt removal under direct vision.

7. **Intubation** if laryngoscopy fails to remove the object — endotracheal tube may push the foreign body distally into the bronchus, securing the airway.

8. **Rigid bronchoscopy** — definitive treatment for tracheobronchial foreign bodies. Achieved under general anesthesia in OR. Success rate > 98%. Arrange emergency bronchoscopy even if patient is stabilized — do not defer.

9. **Activate surgical airway** (cricothyrotomy) if all above fail and complete obstruction persists.

10. **Chest X-ray** for all patients with suspected aspiration. If normal and clinical suspicion remains, proceed to bronchoscopy — do not use a negative X-ray to rule out aspiration.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Croup (laryngotracheobronchitis) | Gradual onset, barking cough, low-grade fever, no witnessed choking event, responds to racemic epinephrine/dexamethasone |
| Epiglottitis | High fever, drooling, tripod position, dysphagia, thumb sign on lateral neck X-ray |
| Anaphylaxis | Urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, exposure to allergen, responds to epinephrine |
| Asthma exacerbation | Bilateral wheeze, history of atopy, diffuse air trapping on CXR, responds to bronchodilators |
| Bacterial tracheitis | High fever, toxic appearance, exudative pseudomembrane on laryngoscopy |
| Bronchiolitis (infants) | Viral prodrome, diffuse bilateral wheeze, RSV season |
| Vascular ring | Chronic stridor from birth, bilateral vascular compression on CT |
| Laryngomalacia | Inspiratory stridor since birth, improves prone, worsens supine |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- **Chest X-ray (PA and lateral):** Radiopaque objects visible in < 10% of cases in children (most are organic/radiolucent). Look for: unilateral hyperinflation (ball-valve mechanism — most common finding), atelectasis, mediastinal shift away from obstruction, air trapping on expiratory film
- **Neck X-ray (AP and lateral):** For suspected supraglottic/tracheal foreign bodies
- **Expiratory CXR or lateral decubitus:** If standard films are equivocal — air trapping persists on expiration with partial obstruction
- **CT chest:** Not required routinely; useful for radiolucent bodies in stable patients or operative planning
- **Fluoroscopy:** Dynamic evaluation of air trapping; available in some centers

**Bronchoscopy:** Indicated based on clinical suspicion regardless of radiographic findings. Both diagnostic and therapeutic. Do not delay bronchoscopy waiting for confirmatory imaging if clinical suspicion is high.

## Treatment

**Prehospital/ED — First Aid Phase:**
- Allow effective cough to continue without intervention (partial obstruction with good air entry)
- Abdominal thrusts + back blows for complete obstruction (sequence above)
- Call resuscitation team early

**Pharmacologic Support (adjuncts only):**
- Nebulized racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution in 3 mL NS — for subglottic edema from traumatic FB or post-extraction edema (does not remove FB)
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg IV/IM (max 10 mg) — reduces post-obstruction edema in pediatric patients
- Heliox (70:30 helium:oxygen) — may temporarily reduce work of breathing in partial tracheal obstruction as bridge to bronchoscopy; does not remove FB

**Definitive Extraction — Bronchoscopy:**
- **Rigid bronchoscopy** preferred for tracheobronchial foreign bodies: direct visualization, forceful extraction with graspers, control of ventilation. Success > 98%
- **Flexible bronchoscopy** — useful for distal or upper lobe bronchial FBs in adults; lower extraction success than rigid; may be combined with fluoroscopy
- Extraction via rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia: Hopkins rod or suction tip, optical forceps for grasping
- Post-extraction: assess for airway edema, mucosal injury, residual fragments

**Surgical:**
- Thoracotomy with bronchotomy — reserved for FB not removable bronchoscopically
- Lobectomy/segmentectomy — for chronic retained FB with irreversible lung destruction (bronchiectasis, abscess, fibrosis)

## Disposition

**Immediate OR/Bronchoscopy:**
- All patients with confirmed or highly suspected tracheobronchial FB — arrange rigid bronchoscopy as true emergency even if clinically stable
- Complete or near-complete obstruction not resolved by first-aid maneuvers

**Admission:**
- Post-bronchoscopy observation minimum 4–6 hours for airway edema, pneumothorax, bleeding
- ICU admission for patients who required intubation, prolonged hypoxia, or cardiac arrest
- Patients with aspiration pneumonia or atelectasis requiring treatment

**Discharge:**
- Subglottic foreign bodies clearly expelled (witnessed by clinician), normal exam, normal SpO2, normal voice/cry, no stridor — discharge with return precautions
- If any doubt remains about complete removal or ongoing symptoms — bronchoscopy before discharge

## Pitfalls

1. **Intervening on a patient with a partial obstruction.** A patient who can cough, speak, or cry has a partial obstruction with effective air movement. Attempting Heimlich or back blows risks converting a partial obstruction into a complete one by dislodging the object into the larynx. Do not intervene physically — let them cough.

2. **Ruling out foreign body aspiration based on a normal chest X-ray.** Most aspirated objects are organic and radiolucent (nuts, seeds, food). A normal CXR does not exclude tracheobronchial foreign body. The decision to proceed to bronchoscopy is clinical, not radiographic. A witnessed choking event with persistent symptoms mandates bronchoscopy regardless of imaging.

3. **Blind finger sweeps in the pharynx.** Blind digital removal attempts in an infant or child will push the object distally, converting a supraglottic obstruction to a complete laryngeal obstruction. Only remove a foreign body under direct vision (laryngoscopy).

4. **Delaying bronchoscopy in a "stable" patient.** A bronchial foreign body with partial obstruction may appear clinically stable with mild wheeze and normal oxygen saturation. Complications increase dramatically if the foreign body remains > 24 hours: atelectasis, post-obstructive pneumonia, granulation tissue overgrowth, and bronchiectasis make removal progressively more difficult. Stabilization is not disposition — arrange bronchoscopy the same day.

5. **Attributing unilateral wheeze to asthma without considering aspiration.** Unilateral wheeze not responding to bronchodilators in a child is a foreign body until proven otherwise. Bilateral asthma wheeze is diffuse; unilateral wheeze with localized decreased breath sounds is obstruction.

6. **Missing the diagnosis in adults.** Adults with neurological impairment, dementia, or intoxication cannot provide a history. Recurrent right lower lobe pneumonia, chronic cough, or hemoptysis in an adult with swallowing dysfunction should prompt bronchoscopic evaluation. Meat aspiration (café coronary) in elderly patients can mimic STEMI or sudden cardiac death.

7. **Inadequate post-extraction monitoring.** Post-extraction airway edema, pneumothorax from bronchoscopic trauma, and residual fragments are all recognized complications. Minimum 4–6 hours post-procedure observation is required; repeat imaging if any respiratory deterioration.
