# Hemorrhagic Shock

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Acute blood loss exceeding compensatory mechanisms. Decreased intravascular volume leads to decreased preload, decreased cardiac output, tissue hypoperfusion, anaerobic metabolism, metabolic acidosis, and organ failure. The body compensates with tachycardia, vasoconstriction, and fluid shifts until decompensation occurs.

**ATLS Classification of Hemorrhagic Shock:**

| Parameter | Class I | Class II | Class III | Class IV |
|-----------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Blood loss (mL) | <750 | 750-1500 | 1500-2000 | >2000 |
| Blood loss (% volume) | <15% | 15-30% | 30-40% | >40% |
| Heart rate | <100 | 100-120 | 120-140 | >140 or bradycardia |
| Blood pressure | Normal | Normal | Decreased | Severely decreased |
| Pulse pressure | Normal | Narrowed | Narrowed | Absent |
| Respiratory rate | 14-20 | 20-30 | 30-40 | >35 |
| Mental status | Normal | Anxious | Confused | Obtunded |
| Urine output (mL/hr) | >30 | 20-30 | 5-15 | Negligible |

**Sources of Life-Threatening Hemorrhage (trauma):**
- Chest (hemothorax) — CXR or FAST
- Abdomen/pelvis (solid organ injury, mesenteric injury) — FAST
- Retroperitoneum (pelvic fracture, aortic injury) — pelvic XR, CT
- Long bone fractures (femur = 1-2L blood loss per fracture)
- External/scalp (direct visualization)
- "Blood on the floor and four more": chest, abdomen, pelvis, thigh, external

**Non-Traumatic Causes:**
- GI hemorrhage (variceal, peptic ulcer, diverticular)
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
- Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
- Postpartum hemorrhage
- Coagulopathy-related bleeding

**Early Indicators (before hypotension):**
- Shock Index (HR/SBP) > 0.9 — sensitive indicator before overt hypotension
- Base deficit > -6 mEq/L
- Lactate > 4 mmol/L
- Narrowed pulse pressure
- Delayed capillary refill >3 seconds

## Critical Actions

1. **Control external hemorrhage** — direct pressure, tourniquet for extremity hemorrhage (apply proximal, tighten until bleeding stops, note time). Pelvic binder for pelvic fractures.
2. **Establish large-bore IV access** — two 16g or larger peripheral IVs above the diaphragm. IO access (humeral head 15g or tibial) if IV unsuccessful in 90 seconds.
3. **Transfuse blood products immediately** — uncrossmatched type O pRBCs for Class III/IV. Activate MTP for anticipated ongoing hemorrhage. 1:1:1 pRBC:FFP:platelets.
4. **Administer TXA 1g IV over 10 minutes** within 3 hours of injury, followed by 1g IV over 8 hours.
5. **Identify and control hemorrhage source** — FAST exam, CXR, pelvic XR simultaneously with resuscitation. Surgical hemorrhage control (OR, IR, tube thoracostomy) without delay.
6. **Permissive hypotension** — target SBP 80-90 mmHg and MAP 50-60 mmHg until surgical hemorrhage control. Exception: concomitant TBI (SBP >100 required).

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Cardiogenic shock | JVD, pulmonary edema, poor cardiac function on POCUS, no evidence of bleeding |
| Obstructive shock (tension ptx, tamponade) | JVD, muffled heart sounds or absent breath sounds, POCUS findings |
| Neurogenic shock | Bradycardia + hypotension (warm shock), spinal cord injury, no tachycardia |
| Septic shock | Warm extremities (early), fever, source of infection, distributive pattern |
| Anaphylactic shock | Urticaria, angioedema, bronchospasm, allergen exposure |
| Adrenal crisis | Chronic steroid use, hypotension refractory to fluids, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia |
| Non-hemorrhagic hypovolemia | Dehydration, GI losses — no evidence of bleeding, gradual onset |

## Workup

**Immediate (during resuscitation):**
- FAST exam — free fluid in abdomen, pelvis, pericardium, thorax
- CXR (supine AP) — hemothorax, widened mediastinum
- Pelvic XR — pelvic fracture (if not proceeding directly to CT)
- POC hemoglobin/hematocrit — baseline (single value unreliable in acute hemorrhage; trending is informative)
- POC lactate — base deficit and lactate guide resuscitation adequacy
- ABG/VBG — acidosis severity, base deficit

**Labs:**
- Type and crossmatch — send immediately, do not wait for results to transfuse
- CBC — serial hemoglobin (q30-60 min in active hemorrhage)
- Coagulation panel: INR, PTT, fibrinogen
- BMP — potassium (hyperkalemia with massive transfusion), creatinine, bicarbonate
- Ionized calcium — critically important during massive transfusion
- TEG/ROTEM — if available, guides targeted component therapy
- Pregnancy test — all females of childbearing age (ectopic pregnancy, Rh status)

**Imaging (after initial stabilization):**
- CT with IV contrast (trauma pan-scan: head, c-spine, chest, abdomen, pelvis) — identifies source in blunt trauma
- CT angiography — for vascular injury, embolization targets
- Angiography (IR suite) — therapeutic for pelvic hemorrhage, solid organ hemorrhage amenable to embolization

## Treatment

**Damage Control Resuscitation (DCR):**
- Minimize crystalloid — limit to 1L NS/LR maximum before switching to blood products. Excessive crystalloid worsens coagulopathy, acidosis (normal saline), and edema.
- 1:1:1 ratio pRBC:FFP:platelets — per PROPPR trial
- Permissive hypotension (SBP 80-90) until surgical hemorrhage control
- Correct the lethal triad: hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy

**Blood Product Administration:**
- Uncrossmatched type O blood (O-neg for females of childbearing age) — do not wait for crossmatch
- MTP coolers: typically 6 pRBC, 6 FFP, 1 apheresis platelet per cooler
- Calcium chloride 1g IV per 4 units blood products (or calcium gluconate 3g IV peripherally)
- Cryoprecipitate 10 units if fibrinogen <150 mg/dL
- TXA 1g IV over 10 min then 1g over 8h (within 3 hours of injury; harmful if delayed beyond 3h)

**Hemorrhage Control Interventions:**
- Tourniquet — extremity hemorrhage. High and tight. Document time of application.
- Pelvic binder/sheet wrap — circumferential at level of greater trochanters, reduces pelvic volume and tamponades venous bleeding
- Tube thoracostomy — hemothorax. 28-32 Fr chest tube. Autotransfusion if >500 mL output.
- Resuscitative thoracotomy — indications: penetrating thoracic trauma with witnessed cardiac arrest or loss of vitals within 15 minutes. Cross-clamp descending aorta, open pericardium, control cardiac/pulmonary hemorrhage.
- REBOA (Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta) — Zone 1 (supraceliac) for abdominal hemorrhage, Zone 3 (infrarenal) for pelvic hemorrhage. Bridge to OR/IR.
- Damage control surgery — abbreviated laparotomy with hemorrhage control and contamination control. Temporary abdominal closure. Planned re-exploration at 24-48h after ICU resuscitation.
- Interventional radiology embolization — pelvic fracture hemorrhage, solid organ hemorrhage (spleen, liver, kidney) in hemodynamically improving patients.

**Vasopressors:**
- NOT first-line — volume replacement is primary
- Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min or vasopressin 0.04 units/min as bridge during massive hemorrhage when blood products are not yet available or patient is in extremis
- Push-dose epinephrine: 10-20 mcg IV (1 mL of 10 mcg/mL concentration) for peri-arrest

**Goal-Directed Resuscitation Endpoints:**
- Lactate clearance >20% per 2 hours
- Base deficit normalizing toward zero
- Urine output >0.5 mL/kg/hr
- Normalization of heart rate and blood pressure
- Cessation of active bleeding (surgical/IR confirmation)

## Disposition

**Operating Room (emergent):**
- Class III/IV hemorrhagic shock with identified surgical source
- Positive FAST with hemodynamic instability
- Penetrating torso trauma with hemodynamic instability
- Resuscitative thoracotomy performed in ED

**Interventional Radiology:**
- Pelvic fracture hemorrhage not amenable to external fixation
- Solid organ hemorrhage in hemodynamically improving patient (after pelvic binder, initial resuscitation)
- Active extravasation on CT angiography with non-surgical source

**ICU Admission (all patients):**
- Post-damage control surgery
- Ongoing blood product transfusion
- Lethal triad management (warming, acidosis correction, coagulopathy correction)
- Serial abdominal exams and repeat imaging
- Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome (bladder pressure >20 mmHg)

**Never discharge a patient with hemorrhagic shock from the ED.**

## Pitfalls

1. **Relying on blood pressure to diagnose hemorrhagic shock.** Young patients compensate with tachycardia and vasoconstriction until 30-40% blood volume is lost. Shock Index >0.9, narrowed pulse pressure, lactate, and base deficit detect hemorrhage earlier than systolic blood pressure alone.

2. **Aggressive crystalloid resuscitation.** Crystalloid dilutes clotting factors, worsens hypothermia, causes interstitial edema, and increases abdominal compartment syndrome risk. Limit to 1L, then switch to blood products. DCR means blood, not saline.

3. **Delaying surgical hemorrhage control for further workup.** A hemodynamically unstable patient with a positive FAST goes to the OR, not the CT scanner. CT is for the hemodynamically improving patient with unclear anatomy. Resuscitation without source control is futile.

4. **Forgetting to replace calcium during massive transfusion.** Citrate in stored blood chelates ionized calcium. Hypocalcemia causes cardiac dysfunction, vasodilation, and coagulopathy. Empirically give calcium chloride 1g IV per 4 units transfused. Monitor ionized calcium on ABG.

5. **Applying permissive hypotension to TBI patients.** SBP <90 doubles mortality in TBI. If hemorrhagic shock and TBI coexist, the blood pressure target is SBP >100 mmHg, not 80-90. This requires aggressive transfusion and possibly vasopressors.

6. **Missing non-compressible torso hemorrhage.** The five sites of hemorrhagic death: chest, abdomen, pelvis, retroperitoneum, and thigh. External bleeding is obvious. Internal bleeding kills silently. FAST, CXR, and pelvic XR are simultaneous with primary survey.

7. **Administering TXA beyond the 3-hour window.** CRASH-2 showed increased mortality with TXA given >3 hours post-injury. The clock starts at time of injury. Late TXA is contraindicated.

8. **Not placing a pelvic binder early.** Open-book pelvic fractures bleed from disrupted venous plexus and cancellous bone. A simple circumferential sheet or commercial binder reduces pelvic volume and tamponades hemorrhage. Apply on the ambulance or during primary survey.

9. **Ignoring hypothermia.** Blood products through unwarmed tubing and large-volume resuscitation drop core temperature rapidly. Hypothermia at 34°C reduces clotting factor activity by 50%. Use rapid infusers with in-line warmers, forced-air warming, and warm the resuscitation bay.

10. **Failing to obtain a pregnancy test.** Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening cause of hemorrhagic shock in females of childbearing age. Point-of-care urine or serum hCG takes minutes and changes management entirely.
