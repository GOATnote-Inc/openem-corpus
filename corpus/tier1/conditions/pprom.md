# Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes

## Recognition

**Definition:** Rupture of fetal membranes before 37 0/7 weeks of gestation occurring prior to the onset of labor. PPROM complicates approximately 3% of pregnancies and is the precipitating factor in 30–40% of preterm births.

**Gestational Age Categories and Clinical Significance:**
| GA Category | Range | Key Issues |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| Periviable | < 24 weeks | Highest neonatal mortality; pulmonary hypoplasia; 43–57% maternal morbidity |
| Early preterm | 24 0/7 – 33 6/7 weeks | Prematurity vs. infection/cord prolapse balance; expectant management generally preferred |
| Late preterm | 34 0/7 – 36 6/7 weeks | Delivery generally recommended; fetal maturity vs. infection risk |
| Near-term | 37+ weeks (term PROM) | Delivery generally indicated — distinct entity from PPROM |

**Presentation:**
- Sudden gush of clear fluid from vagina (most common) — may be intermittent or continuous
- Inability to stop leaking despite Kegel contraction
- Reduced fundal height relative to gestational age
- History of leaking for hours to days before presentation
- Suprapubic pressure, contractions (may indicate chorioamnionitis or preterm labor)

**Examination (sterile speculum — DO NOT perform digital cervical exam unless delivery is imminent):**
- **Pooling:** Amniotic fluid pooling in posterior vaginal fornix — most specific finding
- **Ferning:** Dried amniotic fluid on glass slide produces arborization (fern-like) pattern; cervical mucus produces thick arborization only
- **Nitrazine:** pH > 6.0 turns nitrazine paper blue/black; amniotic fluid pH 7.0–7.4; false positives with blood, semen, vaginitis, antiseptics
- **AmniSure/PAMG-1:** Immunoassay detecting placental alpha microglobulin-1 in vaginal fluid; sensitivity 98.9–100%, specificity 99.1–100%; confirms diagnosis when clinical exam equivocal

**Complications to Identify Immediately:**
- **Cord prolapse:** Digital exam if cord felt or suspected; continuous monitoring if non-cephalic presentation with dilated cervix
- **Chorioamnionitis:** Fever > 38°C, maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia (FHR > 160), uterine tenderness, purulent/malodorous amniotic fluid; WBC > 15,000 (non-specific, may be elevated in labor)
- **Placental abruption:** Vaginal bleeding, uterine pain/tenderness, category II/III fetal tracing
- **Active labor:** Cervical change on serial exams
- **Fetal malpresentation:** Assess with ultrasound

## Critical Actions

1. **Sterile speculum exam — not digital cervical exam.** Digital exam introduces infection and accelerates labor. Reserve digital exam for imminent delivery only.

2. **Establish gestational age and confirm singleton/multiple gestation** via ultrasound. Assess fetal presentation, amniotic fluid index (AFI), estimated fetal weight, placental location.

3. **Continuous electronic fetal monitoring** — detect cord compression (variable decelerations), fetal bradycardia (cord prolapse), and fetal tachycardia (chorioamnionitis).

4. **Evaluate for immediate delivery indications:** chorioamnionitis, cord prolapse, non-reassuring fetal status, placental abruption. If any present — deliver regardless of gestational age.

5. **IV access, CBC, C-reactive protein, urinalysis/urine culture.** Cultures (vaginal/rectal GBS swab, high vaginal swab). Blood cultures if fever present.

6. **GBS prophylaxis if GBS status unknown or positive** — penicillin G 5 million units IV loading dose, then 2.5–3 million units IV every 4 hours until delivery. Penicillin-allergic (low risk of anaphylaxis): ampicillin 2 g IV q4h. Penicillin-allergic (high risk/anaphylaxis): vancomycin 1 g IV q12h (after cultures) or clindamycin 900 mg IV q8h if susceptible.

7. **Latency antibiotics** (if no chorioamnionitis, < 34 weeks, no penicillin allergy):
   - Ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours AND erythromycin 250 mg IV every 6 hours for 48 hours, THEN
   - Amoxicillin 250 mg orally every 8 hours AND erythromycin 333 mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days
   - Azithromycin 1 g orally single dose is an alternative to erythromycin (ACOG, SOGC)
   - Avoid amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) — associated with necrotizing enterocolitis in the ORACLE I trial

8. **Antenatal corticosteroids** for fetal lung maturity (24 0/7 – 33 6/7 weeks):
   - Betamethasone 12 mg IM every 24 hours for 2 doses
   - Maximum benefit achieved after 24 hours from first dose; give even if delivery expected within 48 hours

9. **Magnesium sulfate for neuroprotection** if delivery anticipated < 32 weeks:
   - Loading dose: 4–6 g IV over 20–30 minutes, then maintenance 1–2 g/hour until delivery
   - Reduces risk of cerebral palsy and severe motor dysfunction in surviving preterm neonates

10. **OB specialist consultation** for all PPROM — these patients require inpatient admission and multidisciplinary management. Emergency physician role is initial stabilization, diagnosis, immediate-complication management, and specialist engagement.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Urinary incontinence | Unable to control; negative nitrazine/ferning/PAMG-1; no pooling; urinalysis positive |
| Increased vaginal discharge | Normal pH, no ferning, leukorrhea on wet prep, no pooling in vaginal vault |
| Cervical mucus plug passage | Thick, mucoid, not clear/watery; no pooling; normal nitrazine |
| Vaginitis/bacterial vaginosis | Positive nitrazine (false positive); thin homogenous discharge; clue cells on wet prep; amine odor |
| Vesicovaginal fistula | Continuous leakage from prior surgical history; normal amniotic fluid index; confirmed with indigo carmine instillation via amniocentesis |
| Term PROM | Identical presentation but at or beyond 37 weeks — management diverges significantly |

## Workup

**Initial Assessment:**
- Sterile speculum exam: pooling, ferning, nitrazine; cervical os inspection (dilation, cord visualization)
- PAMG-1 (AmniSure) if initial clinical exam equivocal
- Ultrasound: fetal biometry (EFW, GA confirmation), presentation, AFI (oligohydramnios confirms rupture), placental location, cervical length
- Electronic fetal monitoring: minimum 20–30 minutes; continuous if fetal heart rate concerns
- CBC with differential, CRP, urinalysis/culture, vaginal-rectal GBS swab
- Blood cultures if fever or maternal tachycardia present
- Amniocentesis (if diagnosis uncertain): glucose < 14 mg/dL suggests intra-amniotic infection; indigo carmine dye instillation confirms communication with vaginal pool

**Ongoing Monitoring (hospitalized patient):**
- Daily maternal vitals for chorioamnionitis surveillance (temperature, heart rate)
- Daily fetal heart rate monitoring
- Serial CBC/CRP (frequency institution-dependent, typically q48–72h)
- Ultrasound q7 days: growth, AFI, biophysical profile
- Serial cervical assessment (digital — only with delivery plan or imminent labor)

## Treatment

**Expectant Management (24 0/7 – 33 6/7 weeks, no contraindications):**
- Hospitalize for continuous monitoring
- Latency antibiotics as above (7-day course total)
- Antenatal corticosteroids (single course)
- Magnesium sulfate neuroprotection if < 32 weeks and delivery anticipated
- Tocolytics: may be used short-term (48 hours) to allow corticosteroid completion; not recommended beyond 48 hours — do NOT use tocolysis in the setting of chorioamnionitis
- GBS prophylaxis at active labor

**Delivery Indications (regardless of gestational age):**
- Chorioamnionitis (clinical diagnosis — fever + ≥ 1 additional sign)
- Cord prolapse
- Non-reassuring fetal status (category III tracing or prolonged bradycardia)
- Abruptio placentae
- Active labor with advanced cervical dilation

**Gestational Age-Specific Delivery Threshold:**
- 34 0/7 weeks: deliver (ACOG recommendation) — risks of prematurity outweighed by infection/abruption risks
- 32 0/7 – 33 6/7 weeks: individualized; delivery if lung maturity confirmed by amniocentesis (L/S ratio ≥ 2.0, PG positive) or if clinical deterioration
- 24 0/7 – 31 6/7 weeks: expectant management with all adjuncts unless delivery indication present

**Chorioamnionitis Treatment:**
- Ampicillin 2 g IV every 6 hours PLUS gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV every 24 hours (or 1.5 mg/kg q8h)
- If cesarean delivery: add clindamycin 900 mg IV or metronidazole 500 mg IV for anaerobic coverage
- Continue antibiotics until afebrile 24–48 hours postpartum
- Deliver — chorioamnionitis is an absolute indication for delivery

**Cord Prolapse Management:**
- Manual elevation of presenting part with vaginal hand — maintain pressure until OR
- Place patient in Trendelenburg or knee-chest position
- Immediate cesarean delivery
- Fill bladder with 500–750 mL sterile saline via Foley catheter (elevates presenting part)
- Do NOT reduce cord — keep it warm and moist; minimize handling to prevent vasospasm

## Disposition

**All PPROM patients require inpatient admission.**

**Immediate delivery/OR:**
- Chorioamnionitis
- Cord prolapse
- Non-reassuring fetal status
- Placental abruption
- Gestational age ≥ 34 weeks (arrange delivery with OB)

**Labor and Delivery Unit Admission:**
- All PPROM patients < 34 weeks without immediate delivery indication
- Continuous monitoring, antibiotics, corticosteroids as appropriate

**Transfer:**
- Any PPROM patient with gestational age < 32 weeks should be transferred to a facility with neonatal intensive care capability (level III or IV NICU) if not already at such a facility
- Stabilize before transfer: IV access, monitoring, prophylactic antibiotics, corticosteroids if indicated
- Cord prolapse is NOT stable for transfer — deliver at presenting facility

## Pitfalls

1. **Performing digital cervical exam before speculum exam.** Digital exam introduces vaginal flora into the cervical canal, significantly accelerating ascending infection and preterm labor. The interval from digital exam to delivery shortens measurably with each exam in PPROM. Sterile speculum exam is the standard; defer digital exam until delivery is imminent or decided.

2. **Discharging a patient with PPROM based on a normal appearance.** PPROM requires inpatient admission for all patients with confirmed rupture at preterm gestations. The decision to discharge is never an emergency physician decision — it requires OB specialist evaluation. Chorioamnionitis, cord prolapse, and abruptio placenta can develop hours after a reassuring initial exam.

3. **Relying on nitrazine alone to confirm or exclude PPROM.** Nitrazine has a false-positive rate of 17% (blood, semen, vaginitis, antiseptics all produce alkaline pH). Pooling of clear fluid in the vaginal vault is the most specific clinical sign. When nitrazine is positive but pooling is absent, confirm with ferning or PAMG-1 (AmniSure) before establishing diagnosis.

4. **Using amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) as the antibiotic for PPROM.** The ORACLE I trial demonstrated that amoxicillin-clavulanate was associated with a significantly increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates born to mothers with PPROM. Use ampicillin + erythromycin (or azithromycin as alternative to erythromycin). Augmentin is contraindicated in this setting.

5. **Failing to administer corticosteroids because delivery seems far off.** Betamethasone requires 24 hours to achieve peak fetal benefit. Administer as soon as PPROM is confirmed in eligible gestational ages (24 0/7 – 33 6/7 weeks), even if delivery does not appear imminent. Clinical deterioration can mandate rapid delivery; every hour of steroid exposure provides incremental fetal benefit.

6. **Delaying delivery for chorioamnionitis while completing antibiotic courses.** Chorioamnionitis is a delivery indication, not a contraindication to delivery or a condition to treat before delivery. Antibiotics treat maternal infection and reduce neonatal sepsis risk, but delivery is the definitive treatment. Delay worsens fetal outcome and increases risk of maternal sepsis, uterine rupture, and neonatal morbidity.

7. **Missing cord prolapse in a malpresenting fetus.** Cord prolapse risk is highest with transverse, oblique, or footling breech presentations combined with a dilated cervix and ruptured membranes. Any non-cephalic presentation with PPROM and cervical dilation requires continuous monitoring and low threshold for digital exam. Sudden onset variable decelerations or bradycardia after membrane rupture should prompt immediate digital exam to palpate for cord.
