# Aspiration Pneumonia

## Recognition

**Distinguish aspiration pneumonitis from aspiration pneumonia:**
- **Aspiration pneumonitis (chemical):** Acute chemical injury from gastric acid aspiration. Rapid onset (within 1-2 hours). Diffuse bilateral infiltrates, hypoxemia. Fever/WBC from inflammatory response (not infection). Often resolves in 24-48 hours without antibiotics. (Mendelson syndrome)
- **Aspiration pneumonia (infectious):** Bacterial infection from aspiration of oropharyngeal flora. Onset over 24-72 hours. Focal infiltrate in dependent lung segments. Fever, productive cough, leukocytosis. Requires antibiotics.

**Presentation:**
- Witnessed aspiration event (vomiting, choking during feeding, post-procedural)
- Cough, dyspnea, fever, tachypnea
- Hypoxemia, crackles on auscultation
- Dependent segment infiltrates on CXR: right lower lobe (most common — right mainstem angle), posterior segments of upper lobes (if supine), superior segments of lower lobes

**Risk factors:**
- Altered consciousness: alcoholism, seizures, drug overdose, general anesthesia, stroke
- Dysphagia: stroke, Parkinson disease, MS, ALS, esophageal disorders
- Poor dentition/periodontal disease (increases bacterial load of aspirated material)
- GERD, gastroparesis, NG/feeding tube, tracheostomy
- Elderly patients in nursing homes (up to 10% of nursing home-acquired pneumonias)

**Microbiology:**
- Community-acquired: oropharyngeal flora — Streptococcus spp, anaerobes (Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus)
- Hospital-acquired: gram-negatives (Klebsiella, E. coli, Pseudomonas), MRSA, anaerobes

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Suction airway | Immediate |
| Supplemental O2 | Immediate |
| Assess airway protection | < 5 minutes |
| Antibiotics (if pneumonia, not just pneumonitis) | < 2 hours |

1. **Suction oropharynx/trachea** if active aspiration — clear airway immediately
2. **Assess need for intubation** — if unable to protect airway (GCS <= 8, absent gag reflex)
3. **Supplemental O2** — titrate to SpO2 > 92%
4. **Distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia:**
   - If witnessed aspiration < 2 hours ago with no pre-existing fever/infection: observe, supportive care, withhold antibiotics initially
   - If onset > 48 hours after suspected aspiration, or new fever/infiltrate days later: treat as infectious aspiration pneumonia
5. **Antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia:**
   - Community-acquired: ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h (preferred) or clindamycin 600 mg IV q8h + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h
   - Hospital-acquired: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h or meropenem 1 g IV q8h ± vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h
6. **NPO until swallow evaluation** if aspiration risk ongoing
7. **Elevate head of bed 30-45 degrees** — reduces aspiration risk

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Community-acquired pneumonia (non-aspiration)** — may be indistinguishable; treat as CAP if no clear aspiration history
- **Pulmonary edema** — bilateral, responds to diuretics; BNP elevated
- **ARDS** — bilateral opacities, P/F < 300; aspiration can cause ARDS
- **Lung abscess** — cavitary lesion; may develop as complication of aspiration pneumonia
- **Chemical pneumonitis** — rapid onset post-aspiration, resolves 24-48 hours without antibiotics; differentiate from infection
- **Lipoid pneumonia** — chronic aspiration of mineral oil or other oils; CT shows fat-density consolidation

## Workup

- **CXR:** Dependent segment infiltrate — right lower lobe most common. May not be visible for 12-24 hours after aspiration event.
- **CT chest:** If CXR non-diagnostic or complication suspected (abscess, empyema)
- **Labs:** CBC (leukocytosis), BMP, lactate, ABG (if hypoxemic), procalcitonin (may help distinguish pneumonitis from pneumonia at 48 hours — procalcitonin < 0.25 favors pneumonitis)
- **Blood cultures:** If febrile or severe presentation
- **Sputum culture:** If productive cough; often contaminated with oral flora
- **Swallowing evaluation (speech-language pathology):** After stabilization — video fluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) or fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) for at-risk patients

## Treatment

### Aspiration Pneumonitis (Chemical — No Infection)
- Supportive care: supplemental O2, suctioning, airway management
- No antibiotics initially — most chemical pneumonitis resolves in 24-48 hours
- If no improvement at 48 hours or clinical deterioration: start antibiotics (bacterial superinfection likely)
- Corticosteroids: NOT recommended (no proven benefit, may increase infection risk)

### Aspiration Pneumonia (Infectious)
- **Community-acquired:**
  - Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h (covers oral flora including anaerobes)
  - OR clindamycin 600 mg IV q8h (if penicillin allergic) + ceftriaxone 2 g IV q24h
  - Moxifloxacin 400 mg IV daily (if both penicillin and clindamycin allergic — has anaerobic coverage)
- **Hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated:**
  - Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h or meropenem 1 g IV q8h
  - + Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (MRSA coverage)
- **Duration:** 5-7 days (uncomplicated); longer if abscess or empyema develops

### Aspiration Prevention
- NPO until formal swallow evaluation in stroke/neurologic patients
- HOB elevation 30-45 degrees during and after feeds
- Thickened liquids per SLP recommendation
- Oral hygiene protocol (reduces bacterial load of aspirated material)
- Post-pyloric feeding tube for recurrent aspiration

## Disposition

- **ICU admission:** Respiratory failure requiring intubation, severe hypoxemia, septic shock
- **Inpatient admission:** Hypoxemia requiring supplemental O2, bilateral infiltrates, IV antibiotics needed, unable to protect airway
- **Observation:** Witnessed aspiration with normal CXR and SpO2 — observe 6-12 hours for development of infiltrate or symptoms
- **Discharge:** Mild aspiration pneumonia, tolerating PO antibiotics, SpO2 > 94% on room air, adequate oral intake, reliable follow-up
- **SLP evaluation:** All patients with stroke, neurologic disease, or recurrent aspiration before resuming oral intake

## Pitfalls

1. **Giving antibiotics for witnessed aspiration (pneumonitis) before infection develops.** Aspiration of gastric contents causes chemical pneumonitis that resolves in 24-48 hours without antibiotics. Premature antibiotics promote resistant organisms. Observe and reassess at 48 hours — start antibiotics only if clinical deterioration or failure to improve.

2. **Not covering anaerobes in aspiration pneumonia.** Standard CAP antibiotics (azithromycin + ceftriaxone) do not adequately cover the anaerobic oral flora that drive aspiration pneumonia. Ampicillin-sulbactam, clindamycin, or moxifloxacin should be used for anaerobic coverage.

3. **Resuming oral intake without swallow evaluation in high-risk patients.** Recurrent aspiration perpetuates pneumonia. Patients with stroke, altered consciousness, or neurologic disease should remain NPO until formal swallowing evaluation by speech-language pathology.

4. **Attributing a right lower lobe infiltrate to "just pneumonia" without considering aspiration.** Right lower lobe is the most common site of aspiration pneumonia due to the right mainstem bronchus anatomy. In elderly, institutionalized, or neurologically impaired patients, aspiration should always be on the differential.

5. **Failing to elevate the head of bed.** HOB elevation to 30-45 degrees is one of the simplest and most effective interventions to reduce aspiration risk, especially in intubated patients, patients with NG tubes, and during feeding. This is frequently overlooked.
