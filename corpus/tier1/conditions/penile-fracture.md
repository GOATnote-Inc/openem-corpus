# Penile Fracture

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Audible "popping" or "cracking" sound during erect penis trauma (sexual intercourse, masturbation, rolling over in bed)
- Immediate loss of erection
- Rapid swelling, ecchymosis, and penile deviation contralateral to the rupture site
- "Eggplant deformity" — swollen, purple, deviated penis
- Blood at the urethral meatus suggests concomitant urethral injury (10-20% of cases)

**Mechanism:**
- Rupture of the tunica albuginea during forced bending of the erect penis
- Most common during vigorous sexual intercourse (partner on top position)
- Less commonly: forceful manipulation, rolling over onto erect penis, hitting against hard surface

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Clinical diagnosis | At presentation |
| Retrograde urethrogram if blood at meatus | Before catheterization |
| Urology consultation | Immediate |
| Surgical repair | < 24 hours |

1. **Clinical diagnosis** — history and exam are usually sufficient; do NOT delay for imaging
2. **Assess for urethral injury** — blood at meatus, hematuria, inability to void
3. **Retrograde urethrogram** if urethral injury suspected (before any catheter placement)
4. **Urology consultation** for emergent surgical repair
5. **Do NOT attempt manual manipulation or splinting**
6. **Pain control** — ketorolac 30 mg IV, ice packs

## Differential Diagnosis

- Dorsal vein rupture (Mondor disease) — no loss of erection, midline dorsal swelling, no "pop"
- Penile hematoma from superficial vessel injury — no loss of erection, no tunical defect
- Priapism — persistent erection without traumatic mechanism
- Paraphimosis — foreskin trapped, no history of trauma with erection
- Penile Peyronie plaque fracture — chronic plaque history, less dramatic presentation

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis is standard** — classic history and exam findings are sufficient
- **Retrograde urethrogram:** if blood at meatus, hematuria, or difficulty voiding — identifies urethral injury before catheterization
- **Penile ultrasound:** can identify tunical defect location if diagnosis uncertain; not required in classic presentation
- **MRI penis:** highest sensitivity for tunical defect location; useful if surgical planning is complex or presentation is atypical. Not routinely needed.
- **Urinalysis:** assess for hematuria (surrogate for urethral injury)

## Treatment

### Surgical Repair (Standard of Care)
- **Emergent surgical exploration and repair** — degloving of the penis, identification of tunical defect, closure with absorbable sutures (3-0 or 4-0 PDS or Vicryl)
- **Urethral repair** simultaneously if urethral injury confirmed
- Early repair (< 24 hours) associated with lower rates of erectile dysfunction (< 5% vs > 50% with conservative management)
- **Post-operative:** compressive dressing, sexual abstinence for 6-8 weeks

### Pre-Operative ED Management
- **Ketorolac 30 mg IV** for pain
- **Ice packs** to reduce swelling
- **NPO status** once surgical decision made
- **Do NOT catheterize** until urethral injury is excluded
- **Cefazolin 2 g IV** within 60 minutes of incision (surgical prophylaxis)

### Conservative Management (Only If Surgery Unavailable)
- Compression dressing, ice, NSAIDs, sexual abstinence
- Associated with significantly higher rates of ED (> 50%), penile curvature, and painful erections
- Surgical repair is strongly preferred

## Disposition

- **All penile fractures:** Admission for emergent surgical repair
- **Post-operative:** same-day discharge or 23-hour observation; urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks
- **Transfer:** if no urology coverage, transfer to a center with urologic surgical capability; do not delay for imaging

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying surgery for unnecessary imaging.** Penile fracture is a clinical diagnosis. MRI or ultrasound can confirm equivocal cases but should not delay surgical repair. Time to repair correlates directly with long-term erectile function.

2. **Missing concomitant urethral injury.** Blood at the meatus, hematuria, or inability to void mandates retrograde urethrogram before catheter placement. Urethral injury occurs in 10-20% and requires simultaneous repair.

3. **Attempting conservative management when surgery is available.** Conservative management leads to > 50% rate of erectile dysfunction, curvature, and painful erections. Early surgical repair produces > 95% satisfactory outcomes.

4. **Catheterizing before ruling out urethral injury.** Blind catheterization in the setting of urethral rupture can convert a partial tear to a complete disruption. Retrograde urethrogram first if any suspicion.

5. **Confusing dorsal vein rupture with penile fracture.** Rupture of the dorsal penile vein causes midline swelling without loss of erection and without a tunical defect. This does not require surgery. Ultrasound can differentiate if uncertain.
