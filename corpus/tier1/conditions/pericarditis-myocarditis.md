# Pericarditis and Myocarditis

## Recognition

### Acute Pericarditis

**Diagnosis requires at least 2 of 4 criteria (ESC 2015):**
1. Chest pain — sharp, pleuritic, worse supine, improved sitting forward and leaning
2. Pericardial friction rub — pathognomonic but transient, heard in only 33% of cases; scratchy, high-pitched, best heard at left lower sternal border with patient sitting forward at end-expiration; classically has 3 components (atrial systole, ventricular systole, early diastolic filling)
3. ECG changes — diffuse ST elevation with PR depression (see ECG staging below)
4. New or worsening pericardial effusion on echocardiography

**ECG stages of pericarditis:**
- **Stage I (hours to days):** Diffuse concave-up ST elevation in leads I, II, III, aVF, V3-V6; PR depression in II, aVF, V4-V6; reciprocal ST depression and PR elevation in aVR (and sometimes V1)
- **Stage II (days to 1 week):** ST segments normalize; T-wave flattening
- **Stage III (weeks):** Diffuse T-wave inversions
- **Stage IV (weeks to months):** ECG normalizes

**Distinguishing pericarditis from STEMI:**
- Pericarditis: diffuse ST elevation (not confined to a vascular territory), concave-up morphology, PR depression in limb leads, no reciprocal ST depression (except aVR), Spodick sign (downsloping TP segment)
- STEMI: ST elevation in a vascular territory, convex-up or tombstone morphology, reciprocal ST depression, Q-wave development, localized PR depression rare

**High-risk features requiring hospitalization (ESC 2015):**
- Fever > 38 degrees C
- Subacute onset
- Large pericardial effusion (> 20 mm diastolic)
- Cardiac tamponade
- Failure to respond to NSAIDs within 7 days
- Elevated troponin (suggests myopericarditis)
- Immunosuppression
- Oral anticoagulant therapy
- Traumatic etiology

### Myocarditis

**Classic presentation:**
- Chest pain (typically less positional than pericarditis) + troponin elevation + new wall motion abnormality
- Often preceded by viral prodrome (1-4 weeks prior): fever, myalgia, respiratory or GI symptoms
- Predominantly affects young adults (median age 20-40)

**Clinical spectrum:**
- **Subclinical:** ECG changes or mild troponin elevation with preserved function
- **Acute:** Chest pain, heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias
- **Fulminant:** Rapid-onset cardiogenic shock within days; paradoxically better long-term prognosis if survived (higher rate of complete recovery vs. acute)
- **Chronic/dilated cardiomyopathy:** Late sequela of unresolved myocarditis

**Red flags for fulminant myocarditis:**
- Hemodynamic instability (SBP < 90, requiring vasopressors)
- New-onset ventricular arrhythmias (VT, VF)
- Rapidly progressive heart failure (hours to days)
- Cardiogenic shock
- High-degree AV block

**Sudden cardiac death risk:**
- Myocarditis accounts for up to 20% of sudden cardiac death in young athletes and military recruits
- Ventricular arrhythmias may be the presenting event with no prior symptoms

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| ECG | < 10 minutes from presentation |
| Troponin | At presentation; serial if initial negative and suspicion persists |
| Bedside echocardiography | Within 1 hour (sooner if hemodynamic compromise) |
| Cardiology consultation | At diagnosis if myocarditis suspected, troponin elevated, or effusion present |

1. **Obtain 12-lead ECG immediately** and compare with prior if available; differentiate from STEMI before administering anticoagulation
2. **Draw troponin** — elevation indicates myocardial involvement (myopericarditis or myocarditis); serial measurement at 0 and 3-6 hours
3. **Bedside echocardiography** — assess for pericardial effusion, wall motion abnormalities, ventricular function, and signs of tamponade
4. **Start anti-inflammatory therapy for pericarditis** — ibuprofen 600 mg PO TID + colchicine 0.5 mg PO BID (see Treatment)
5. **Do NOT give NSAIDs if myocarditis is suspected** — animal model data suggest worsened myocardial necrosis and mortality; use acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h for pain
6. **Restrict physical activity** — no competitive sports or vigorous exercise until symptom resolution and normalization of biomarkers, ECG, and imaging (minimum 3-6 months for myocarditis per AHA/ACC 2015 eligibility recommendations)
7. **Prepare for hemodynamic collapse in fulminant myocarditis** — have vasopressors, inotropes, and mechanical circulatory support (ECMO, Impella) on standby; early transfer to center with mechanical support capability

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|---|---|
| STEMI | ST elevation in a vascular territory with reciprocal changes; convex-up morphology; troponin rise-and-fall pattern; regional wall motion abnormality on echo |
| Pulmonary embolism | Pleuritic pain but no positional component; tachycardia, hypoxia, RV dilation on echo; S1Q3T3 or right heart strain on ECG; elevated D-dimer |
| Aortic dissection | Tearing pain radiating to back; pulse or BP differential; widened mediastinum; aortic regurgitation murmur |
| Pneumonia with pleuritis | Productive cough, fever, focal lung findings; infiltrate on CXR; no diffuse ST changes |
| Costochondritis | Reproducible chest wall tenderness; normal ECG and troponin; no effusion |
| Takotsubo cardiomyopathy | ST elevation or T-wave inversion; apical ballooning on echo; emotional/physical stress trigger; typically postmenopausal women |
| Cardiac tamponade | JVD, hypotension, muffled heart sounds; pulsus paradoxus; RA/RV diastolic collapse on echo |
| Acute heart failure | Dyspnea, orthopnea, bilateral crackles; elevated BNP; no pericardial rub; dilated ventricles with reduced EF |

## Workup

### All Patients
- **ECG:** 12-lead at presentation; serial ECGs if diagnosis unclear; compare to prior
- **Troponin:** High-sensitivity troponin at 0 and 3-6 hours; elevation in 35-50% of pericarditis (indicates myopericarditis)
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis suggests infectious or inflammatory etiology
- **CRP/ESR:** Elevated in > 75% of acute pericarditis; use CRP to guide treatment duration (treat until normalized)
- **BMP:** Renal function (guides NSAID and colchicine dosing); BUN elevation suggests uremic pericarditis
- **BNP/NT-proBNP:** Elevated if myocarditis with ventricular dysfunction
- **Chest X-ray:** Enlarged cardiac silhouette if large effusion (> 200 mL); pulmonary congestion if concurrent heart failure
- **Echocardiography:** Pericardial effusion (present in ~60% of acute pericarditis); wall motion abnormalities (myocarditis); LV systolic function; tamponade physiology

### If Myocarditis Suspected
- **Cardiac MRI (CMR):** Gold standard for non-invasive diagnosis; Lake Louise criteria: myocardial edema on T2-weighted imaging + late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in a non-coronary distribution (typically epicardial or mid-wall, NOT subendocardial); sensitivity 76%, specificity 96%
- **Coronary angiography or CT coronary angiography:** To exclude ACS in patients with troponin elevation and wall motion abnormalities, especially if age > 35 or cardiovascular risk factors
- **Endomyocardial biopsy:** Considered in hemodynamic compromise not responding to treatment; suspected giant cell myocarditis or eosinophilic myocarditis where specific immunosuppressive therapy is indicated; Dallas criteria for histologic diagnosis (inflammatory infiltrate with myocyte necrosis)

### Directed Testing by Suspected Etiology
- **Blood cultures** if bacterial pericarditis/myocarditis suspected (toxic-appearing, high fever)
- **ANA, anti-dsDNA, complement levels** if autoimmune disease suspected
- **TSH** — hypothyroidism causes pericardial effusion
- **HIV testing** — HIV-associated pericarditis/myocarditis
- **Pericardial fluid analysis** (if drained): cell count, protein, LDH, glucose, cytology, Gram stain, culture, acid-fast bacilli, adenosine deaminase (TB)

## Treatment

### Acute Pericarditis — First-Line

**NSAID + colchicine combination (supported by COPE and CORP-2 trials):**
- **Ibuprofen** 600 mg PO TID with food; taper by 200-400 mg every 1-2 weeks over total treatment duration of 1-2 weeks for first episode
- **Colchicine** 0.5 mg PO BID (if body weight > 70 kg) or 0.5 mg PO daily (if body weight <= 70 kg or intolerant); continue for 3 months for first episode, 6 months for recurrent pericarditis
- GI prophylaxis: omeprazole 20 mg PO daily while on NSAIDs

**Alternatives to ibuprofen:**
- Aspirin 750-1000 mg PO TID (preferred if concurrent ACS or recent MI — NSAIDs other than aspirin are contraindicated within 1-2 weeks of MI)
- Indomethacin 25-50 mg PO TID (effective but more GI and CNS side effects)

**Treatment response:**
- Symptom improvement expected within 24-48 hours
- Monitor CRP weekly; do not taper until CRP normalized
- Failure to respond within 7 days warrants reassessment and hospitalization

### Recurrent Pericarditis
- Restart full-dose NSAIDs + colchicine (continue colchicine 6 months minimum)
- If NSAID-refractory after adequate trial: prednisone 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/day PO, taper very slowly (decrease by 2.5 mg every 2-4 weeks below 15 mg/day); glucocorticoids associated with increased recurrence — avoid as first-line
- Anakinra 100 mg SC daily for colchicine-resistant, corticosteroid-dependent recurrent pericarditis (AIRTRIP trial data)

### Myocarditis — Supportive Care

**Avoid NSAIDs** — animal models demonstrate increased myocardial inflammation and mortality with NSAID use during acute myocarditis.

**Hemodynamically stable:**
- Acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h for pain and fever
- Heart failure therapy if EF reduced: ACE inhibitor (lisinopril 2.5-5 mg PO daily, titrate) + beta-blocker (carvedilol 3.125 mg PO BID, titrate once stable — avoid in acute decompensation)
- Diuresis for volume overload: furosemide 20-40 mg IV PRN
- Continuous telemetry monitoring for arrhythmias
- Activity restriction: no competitive sports or vigorous exercise for minimum 3-6 months after symptom resolution and normalization of biomarkers, ECG, and cardiac imaging

**Hemodynamically unstable / fulminant myocarditis:**
- Norepinephrine 0.05-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV for vasopressor support
- Dobutamine 2-20 mcg/kg/min IV for inotropic support (avoid if sustained tachyarrhythmias)
- Milrinone 0.375-0.75 mcg/kg/min IV (alternative inotrope; may worsen hypotension)
- Mechanical circulatory support: VA-ECMO is preferred for fulminant myocarditis with refractory cardiogenic shock; bridge to recovery in most cases
- Avoid ICD implantation acutely — myocarditis-related arrhythmias may be reversible; reassess at 3-6 months

**Specific etiologies requiring targeted therapy:**
- Giant cell myocarditis: immunosuppression with cyclosporine + corticosteroids (endomyocardial biopsy required for diagnosis)
- Eosinophilic myocarditis: high-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g IV daily x 3 days, then prednisone 1 mg/kg/day taper)
- Cardiac sarcoidosis: corticosteroids + steroid-sparing agents

### Myopericarditis (Overlap)
- Treat as pericarditis if predominant pericardial symptoms with only mild troponin elevation and preserved LV function
- Treat as myocarditis if significant troponin elevation, wall motion abnormalities, or reduced EF
- Colchicine is safe and appropriate in myopericarditis

## Disposition

### Discharge (Uncomplicated Pericarditis)
- Normal hemodynamics, no high-risk features
- Normal troponin (or only minimal elevation with preserved LV function)
- No or trivial pericardial effusion
- Prescribe ibuprofen 600 mg PO TID + colchicine 0.5 mg PO BID
- Follow-up with cardiology within 1 week
- CRP at follow-up to guide treatment taper
- Return precautions: worsening chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, fever

### Admit — Telemetry/Monitored Bed
- Pericarditis with high-risk features (fever, large effusion, troponin elevation, immunosuppression, NSAID failure)
- Myopericarditis with preserved LV function
- Moderate pericardial effusion requiring serial echocardiography

### Admit — ICU
- Cardiac tamponade (see cardiac-tamponade condition file)
- Fulminant myocarditis with hemodynamic instability
- Myocarditis with sustained ventricular arrhythmias
- Cardiogenic shock requiring vasopressor, inotropic, or mechanical circulatory support

### Transfer
- Fulminant myocarditis if no VA-ECMO or mechanical circulatory support capability
- Suspected giant cell myocarditis requiring endomyocardial biopsy at specialized center

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating pericarditis ECG changes as STEMI and activating the cath lab.** Diffuse concave-up ST elevation with PR depression in II/aVF, PR elevation in aVR, and absence of reciprocal ST depression distinguishes pericarditis from STEMI. STEMI causes ST elevation in a vascular territory with reciprocal changes. When uncertain, bedside echocardiography showing diffuse (not regional) wall motion or a pericardial effusion favors pericarditis.

2. **Giving NSAIDs to a patient with myocarditis.** Animal studies consistently show increased myocardial inflammation, necrosis, and mortality with NSAID use during active myocarditis. If troponin is elevated and wall motion abnormalities are present, withhold NSAIDs and use acetaminophen 1 g PO/IV q6h for analgesia. Colchicine remains appropriate.

3. **Discharging pericarditis without colchicine.** The COPE and CORP trials demonstrated that colchicine halves the recurrence rate (from ~30% to ~15% at 18 months). Ibuprofen alone is insufficient. Prescribe colchicine 0.5 mg PO BID for 3 months (first episode) or 6 months (recurrence).

4. **Missing myocarditis in a young patient with chest pain and troponin elevation.** Anchoring on ACS leads to unnecessary catheterization showing clean coronaries. Young patients (< 35) with chest pain, viral prodrome, and troponin elevation should be evaluated for myocarditis with cardiac MRI. Conversely, do not anchor on myocarditis in patients with cardiovascular risk factors — exclude ACS first.

5. **Allowing athletes with myocarditis to return to sports too early.** Myocarditis is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death during exertion in young athletes. Current AHA/ACC recommendations mandate restriction from competitive sports for minimum 3-6 months with documented normalization of LV function, biomarkers, and absence of arrhythmias on ambulatory monitoring before clearance.

6. **Using corticosteroids as first-line therapy for pericarditis.** Steroids are associated with increased recurrence rates and dependency. ESC guidelines reserve corticosteroids for NSAID/colchicine contraindication (renal failure, active GI bleed), autoimmune etiology, or documented NSAID failure. When used, start at low dose (prednisone 0.25-0.5 mg/kg/day) and taper very slowly.

7. **Failing to check CRP before tapering anti-inflammatory therapy.** Premature taper while CRP remains elevated is the most common cause of recurrent pericarditis. Continue full-dose therapy until CRP normalizes, then taper gradually. Weekly CRP monitoring guides treatment duration.

8. **Not recognizing fulminant myocarditis as a distinct emergency.** Fulminant myocarditis progresses from stable hemodynamics to cardiogenic shock within hours. Rapidly falling EF, escalating vasopressor requirements, and new ventricular arrhythmias in a patient with suspected myocarditis demand immediate transfer to a center with VA-ECMO capability. Delay is fatal.

9. **Diagnosing pericarditis based solely on the friction rub.** The rub is pathognomonic when present but is heard in only a minority of cases, is evanescent (present one hour, absent the next), and is frequently obscured by ambient noise. Absence of a friction rub does not exclude pericarditis. The diagnosis requires 2 of 4 criteria: chest pain, rub, ECG changes, or effusion.
