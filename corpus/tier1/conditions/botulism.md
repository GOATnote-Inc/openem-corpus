# Botulism

## Recognition

**Classic presentation — descending flaccid paralysis:**
- Symmetric, bilateral cranial nerve palsies: diplopia, blurred vision, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, facial weakness
- Descending paralysis (cranial nerves → arms → respiratory muscles → legs)
- Dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention (autonomic dysfunction)
- Clear sensorium (cognition preserved)
- No sensory deficits
- Afebrile (unless wound botulism with secondary infection)

**Types:**
- **Foodborne:** 12-36 hours after ingestion of toxin (range 6 hours to 10 days); nausea/vomiting/diarrhea may precede neurologic symptoms
- **Wound:** Injection drug use (black tar heroin), traumatic wounds; 4-14 day incubation
- **Infant:** Age 2 weeks to 12 months; constipation, poor feeding, weak cry, floppy baby
- **Inhalational:** Bioterrorism consideration; 12-80 hours post-exposure

**Red flags suggesting botulism:**
- "4 Ds": Diplopia, Dysarthria, Dysphagia, Descending paralysis
- Symmetric cranial nerve involvement without fever or altered mental status
- Multiple patients from same meal (foodborne cluster)

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess respiratory function immediately** — measure FVC (forced vital capacity) and NIF (negative inspiratory force) serially; intubate if FVC < 15 mL/kg or NIF weaker than -20 cmH2O
2. **Contact state health department immediately** (24-hour number) — they coordinate antitoxin release from CDC
3. **Request botulinum antitoxin (HBAT)** through state health department → CDC (available 24/7, free of charge, shipped emergently)
4. **Administer antitoxin as soon as possible** — most effective within first 48 hours of symptom onset; do NOT wait for laboratory confirmation
5. **Secure airway proactively** — respiratory failure can develop rapidly; patients may appear stable then decompensate
6. **Collect specimens BEFORE antitoxin** — serum, stool, wound specimens; gastric aspirate and suspected food

## Differential Diagnosis

- Myasthenia gravis — fluctuating weakness, positive edrophonium test, acetylcholine receptor antibodies
- Guillain-Barre syndrome — ascending paralysis, CSF albuminocytologic dissociation, post-infectious
- Stroke (brainstem) — asymmetric, acute onset, altered consciousness possible
- Tick paralysis — ascending, rapid recovery after tick removal
- Lambert-Eaton syndrome — proximal weakness, autonomic dysfunction, associated with malignancy
- Organophosphate poisoning — cholinergic crisis (SLUDGE), miosis
- Diphtheria — palatal paralysis, pharyngeal membrane
- Poliomyelitis — asymmetric, febrile, CSF pleocytosis

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — do NOT wait for laboratory confirmation to treat
- **Serum botulinum toxin assay** (mouse bioassay) — send to CDC/state lab; results take 1-4 days
- **Stool culture and toxin assay**
- **Wound culture** (wound botulism) — Clostridium botulinum
- **Suspected food sample** — submit for toxin testing
- **Electromyography (EMG):** Decremental response at low-frequency stimulation; incremental response at high-frequency stimulation (distinguishes from myasthenia gravis)
- **Forced vital capacity (FVC)** — serial measurements q2-4h; intubate if < 15 mL/kg
- **Negative inspiratory force (NIF)** — intubate if weaker than -20 cmH2O
- **CBC, BMP, hepatic panel** — usually normal
- **CSF** — normal (helps exclude GBS)
- **CT/MRI brain** — normal (excludes brainstem stroke)
- **Tensilon (edrophonium) test** — negative (excludes myasthenia gravis)

## Treatment

### Antitoxin
- **Botulism Antitoxin Heptavalent (HBAT)** — equine-derived, covers toxin types A-G
- **Adult dose:** One vial IV (diluted 1:10 in NS, infused over 30 minutes after test dose)
- **Pediatric (age 1-17):** 20-100% of one vial, weight-based (per CDC guidance)
- **Infant botulism (< 1 year):** Do NOT use HBAT; administer **BabyBIG (botulism immune globulin intravenous, human-derived)** 50 mg/kg IV (contact California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program)
- **Test dose** for HBAT: 0.1 mL intradermal; observe for hypersensitivity 20 minutes (keep epinephrine available)
- **Timing:** Administer ASAP; antitoxin prevents further paralysis but does not reverse existing deficits

### Wound Botulism
- Surgical debridement of wound
- Antibiotics: Penicillin G 3 million units IV q4h OR metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h
- Do NOT use aminoglycosides (worsen neuromuscular blockade)

### Supportive Care
- Mechanical ventilation (may be needed for weeks to months)
- NG tube feeding if dysphagia
- DVT prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily)
- Close monitoring in ICU — respiratory deterioration can be sudden
- Physical therapy/rehabilitation

### Drugs to AVOID
- Aminoglycosides, clindamycin, magnesium, neuromuscular blocking agents — all worsen paralysis

## Disposition

- **All confirmed or suspected botulism:** ICU admission with ventilator capability
- **Average ICU stay:** 2-8 weeks; total recovery may take months
- **Notify public health immediately** — critical for:
  - Outbreak investigation (foodborne)
  - Antitoxin procurement
  - Bioterrorism surveillance
- **Reportable:** IMMEDIATELY REPORTABLE to state health department and CDC. Botulism is a public health emergency.
- **Contact tracing:** All individuals who consumed the same food source require evaluation

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for laboratory confirmation before administering antitoxin.** Mouse bioassay takes days. Antitoxin efficacy diminishes with time. Treat based on clinical suspicion.

2. **Misdiagnosing botulism as Guillain-Barre syndrome.** Both cause paralysis, but GBS is ascending, has sensory findings, and shows CSF protein elevation. Botulism is descending, purely motor, with normal CSF.

3. **Failing to monitor respiratory function.** Patients may appear comfortable while FVC is critically declining. Serial FVC and NIF measurements are mandatory. Do not rely on SpO2 — it drops late.

4. **Administering aminoglycosides for wound botulism.** Aminoglycosides potentiate neuromuscular blockade and can precipitate respiratory arrest. Use penicillin or metronidazole.

5. **Not reporting to public health.** Foodborne botulism outbreaks require immediate investigation to prevent additional cases. Even a single case is a public health emergency.

6. **Using HBAT for infant botulism.** Infants < 1 year should receive BabyBIG (human-derived), not HBAT (equine-derived). Contact the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program.
