# Eclampsia

## Recognition

**Definition:** New-onset tonic-clonic seizures in a patient with preeclampsia, or new-onset seizures in pregnancy/postpartum without other identifiable cause. Occurs antepartum (53%), intrapartum (19%), or postpartum (28%) — postpartum eclampsia can present up to 6 weeks after delivery.

**Classic Presentation:**
- Pregnant or recently postpartum patient with generalized tonic-clonic seizure
- Hypertension (SBP >= 140 or DBP >= 90), though 16% are normotensive at seizure onset
- Proteinuria (absent in up to 14%)

**Warning Signs (Impending Eclampsia):**
- Severe persistent headache (frontal/occipital, not responsive to analgesics)
- Visual disturbances (scotomata, blurred vision, cortical blindness)
- Epigastric/RUQ pain (hepatic capsule distension)
- Hyperreflexia with clonus (>= 3 beats)
- Rapidly worsening edema

**Key Findings:**
- Hypertension with severe features: SBP >= 160 or DBP >= 110
- HELLP syndrome overlap: hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets
- Pulmonary edema, oliguria, altered mental status

**High-Risk Populations:** nulliparity, chronic hypertension, prior preeclampsia, multifetal gestation, pregestational diabetes, renal disease, autoimmune disorders, age > 35.

## Critical Actions

1. **Protect airway** — left lateral decubitus position during seizure to prevent aspiration and relieve aortocaval compression. Suction oropharynx. Apply high-flow O2 15 L/min via non-rebreather.
2. **Magnesium sulfate 4-6 g IV over 15-20 minutes** — loading dose for seizure termination and prevention. Follow with 1-2 g/hr continuous infusion.
3. **Treat severe hypertension** — labetalol 20 mg IV over 2 min OR hydralazine 5-10 mg IV over 2 min OR nifedipine 10 mg PO. Goal: SBP 140-150, DBP 90-100. Treat within 30-60 minutes to prevent stroke.
4. **Assess fetal status** — continuous fetal monitoring after maternal stabilization. Transient fetal bradycardia during/after seizure is common and usually resolves within 3-5 minutes.
5. **Obtain labs** — CBC with platelets, CMP (hepatic/renal), LDH, uric acid, coagulation studies, fibrinogen, type and screen.
6. **Call OB emergently** — eclampsia mandates delivery once maternal stabilization achieved. Delivery is the definitive treatment regardless of gestational age.
7. **Monitor for magnesium toxicity** — check patellar reflexes, respiratory rate (hold if RR < 12), urine output (target > 30 mL/hr). Therapeutic level: 4-7 mEq/L. Antidote: calcium gluconate 1 g IV over 3 min.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Epilepsy with breakthrough seizure | Known seizure history, low antiepileptic levels, normal BP, no proteinuria |
| Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis | Headache, focal deficits, seizure, but normal BP possible; confirm with CT venogram |
| Intracranial hemorrhage | Sudden severe headache, focal deficits, abnormal CT; can co-occur with eclampsia |
| Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) | Imaging overlap with eclampsia; vasogenic edema on MRI, often co-occurs |
| Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) | Pentad: thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal failure, fever, neuro changes; ADAMTS13 activity < 10% |
| Meningitis/encephalitis | Fever, neck stiffness, CSF pleocytosis |
| Hypoglycemia | Low glucose on point-of-care testing; rapid reversal with dextrose |
| Drug withdrawal or intoxication | Toxicologic history, urine drug screen |

## Workup

**Labs:**
- CBC with platelet count — thrombocytopenia < 100,000 suggests HELLP
- CMP — creatinine > 1.1 mg/dL, AST/ALT elevation (> 2x ULN), low albumin
- LDH — elevated (> 600 IU/L) in HELLP
- Uric acid — elevated > 6 mg/dL associated with worse outcomes
- Coagulation studies (PT, PTT, fibrinogen) — DIC screening
- Urinalysis with protein/creatinine ratio or 24-hour urine protein (> 300 mg/24hr)
- Type and screen
- Magnesium level baseline and q4-6h during infusion

**Imaging:**
- CT head without contrast — rule out intracranial hemorrhage if focal deficits, prolonged AMS, or atypical presentation
- MRI brain — PRES pattern (bilateral parieto-occipital white matter edema) if available and patient stable
- Obstetric ultrasound — fetal viability, placental assessment, amniotic fluid index

## Treatment

**Seizure Control:**
- Magnesium sulfate 4-6 g IV over 15-20 min loading dose, then 1-2 g/hr maintenance infusion
- Recurrent seizure despite magnesium: additional 2 g IV bolus over 3-5 min
- Refractory seizures (persistent after 2 boluses): lorazepam 2-4 mg IV, or levetiracetam 1000-1500 mg IV over 15 min, or propofol/intubation
- Continue magnesium for 24-48 hours postpartum

**Antihypertensive Therapy (target SBP 140-150, DBP 90-100):**
- Labetalol 20 mg IV, then 40 mg, then 80 mg q10-20 min (max 300 mg total)
- Hydralazine 5-10 mg IV q20 min (max 20 mg)
- Nifedipine 10 mg PO q20-30 min (max 30 mg)
- Nicardipine infusion 5 mg/hr, titrate by 2.5 mg/hr q5-15 min (max 15 mg/hr) for refractory hypertension

**Definitive Treatment:**
- Delivery — regardless of gestational age after maternal stabilization
- Vaginal delivery preferred if cervix favorable and no contraindications
- Cesarean for standard obstetric indications or non-reassuring fetal status

**Fluid Management:**
- Restrict IV fluids to 80-100 mL/hr total to prevent pulmonary edema
- Lactated Ringer's preferred over NS

## Disposition

**All eclampsia patients require ICU or labor and delivery with continuous monitoring.**

**Delivery Timing:**
- Deliver after maternal stabilization (seizure control, BP management)
- Do not delay delivery for steroid course for fetal lung maturity in eclampsia

**Postpartum Monitoring:**
- Continue magnesium sulfate 24-48 hours after last seizure or delivery (whichever is later)
- Monitor BP closely — postpartum eclampsia/preeclampsia peaks at 3-6 days postpartum
- Discharge criteria: BP < 150/100 on oral regimen, falling LFTs, rising platelets, no symptoms

**Transfer Criteria:**
- If facility lacks OB or NICU capabilities, stabilize with magnesium and antihypertensives, then transfer

## Pitfalls

1. **Attributing seizure to epilepsy in a pregnant patient without checking BP and labs.** Any new-onset seizure in pregnancy or postpartum is eclampsia until proven otherwise.

2. **Withholding magnesium sulfate because the patient "already seized."** Magnesium prevents recurrent seizures — 52% reduction per the Magpie Trial. Start it regardless of whether the initial seizure has resolved.

3. **Using benzodiazepines or phenytoin as first-line anticonvulsant.** Magnesium sulfate is superior to both diazepam and phenytoin for eclamptic seizure prevention and recurrence (Collaborative Eclampsia Trial). Benzodiazepines cause neonatal respiratory depression.

4. **Failing to treat severe hypertension urgently.** SBP >= 160 or DBP >= 110 sustained for > 15 minutes requires immediate IV antihypertensive therapy. Intracerebral hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in eclampsia.

5. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation.** Eclampsia patients have intravascular depletion but are total-body fluid overloaded. Aggressive IV fluids cause flash pulmonary edema. Restrict to 80-100 mL/hr total.

6. **Missing postpartum eclampsia.** 28% of eclampsia occurs postpartum, up to 6 weeks after delivery. A postpartum patient with headache, visual changes, or seizure needs BP check and preeclampsia workup.

7. **Stopping magnesium too early.** Continue infusion for 24-48 hours after last seizure or delivery. Premature discontinuation risks recurrent seizures.

8. **Not checking magnesium level and reflexes during infusion.** Magnesium toxicity progresses: loss of patellar reflexes (7-10 mEq/L), respiratory depression (10-13 mEq/L), cardiac arrest (> 15 mEq/L). Monitor reflexes q1h and levels q4-6h. Keep calcium gluconate at bedside.

9. **Delaying delivery for fetal lung maturity steroids.** In eclampsia, delivery is urgent after maternal stabilization. Delaying delivery 24-48 hours for betamethasone increases maternal risk without clear neonatal benefit at this severity.
