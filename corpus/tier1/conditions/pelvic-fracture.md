# Pelvic Fracture

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** The bony pelvis forms a ring structure (two innominate bones + sacrum) stabilized by strong posterior ligamentous complexes (sacrospinous, sacrotuberous, posterior sacroiliac). Disruption of this ring requires high-energy force and implies massive kinetic energy transfer. The retroperitoneal space can accumulate 4-6 L of blood from disrupted presacral venous plexus, fractured cancellous bone surfaces, and branches of the internal iliac arteries. Hemorrhage is venous in 80-90% of cases and arterial in 10-20%. Mortality from hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures ranges from 30-50%.

**Mechanism:**
- Motor vehicle collision (most common)
- Motorcycle collision
- Pedestrian struck by vehicle
- Fall from height >15 feet (4.5 m)
- Crush injury (industrial, structural collapse)
- Low-energy falls in elderly with osteoporosis (insufficiency fractures -- lower hemorrhage risk but high morbidity)

**Young-Burgess Classification (by mechanism of injury):**

| Type | Mechanism | Key Features | Hemorrhage Risk |
|------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| LC-I | Lateral compression, low energy | Ipsilateral sacral buckle fracture + ipsilateral ramus fractures | Low-moderate |
| LC-II | Lateral compression, higher energy | LC-I + ipsilateral iliac wing fracture (crescent fracture) | Moderate |
| LC-III | Lateral compression with contralateral force | LC-II + contralateral open-book pattern (windswept pelvis) | High |
| APC-I | Anteroposterior compression | Symphysis diastasis <2.5 cm, intact posterior ligaments | Low |
| APC-II | Anteroposterior compression, greater force | Symphysis diastasis >2.5 cm, disrupted sacrospinous/sacrotuberous ligaments, intact posterior SI ligaments | High |
| APC-III | Anteroposterior compression, maximal | Complete disruption of symphysis + anterior and posterior SI ligaments (open-book) | Highest |
| VS | Vertical shear | Hemipelvis displaced vertically, complete ligamentous disruption | Very high |
| CM | Combined mechanism | Mixed pattern | Variable, often high |

**Tile Classification (by stability):**
- Type A: Stable -- intact pelvic ring (avulsion fractures, iliac wing fractures, minimally displaced ramus fractures)
- Type B: Rotationally unstable, vertically stable -- partial posterior disruption (APC-II, LC injuries)
- Type C: Rotationally and vertically unstable -- complete posterior disruption (APC-III, VS)

**Clinical Signs:**
- Pelvic instability on compression/distraction (perform ONCE only -- repeated rocking dislodges clot and worsens hemorrhage)
- Leg-length discrepancy (vertical shear)
- Rotational deformity of lower extremity
- Perineal/scrotal ecchymosis (Destot sign -- delayed finding)
- Blood at urethral meatus (urethral injury in 5-10%)
- High-riding prostate on rectal exam (urethral disruption)
- Hemodynamic instability disproportionate to visible injuries

## Critical Actions

1. **Apply pelvic binder immediately** -- commercial circumferential compression device (T-POD, SAM Pelvic Sling) or bedsheet wrap centered at the level of the greater trochanters. Apply before imaging, during primary survey or prehospital. Reduces pelvic volume, tamponades venous bleeding, and reduces fracture displacement. Do NOT apply over the iliac crests (ineffective positioning).

2. **Initiate massive transfusion protocol** for hemodynamically unstable patients. 1:1:1 ratio pRBC:FFP:platelets. Administer TXA 1 g IV over 10 minutes within 3 hours of injury, followed by 1 g IV over 8 hours.

3. **FAST exam** -- evaluate for concurrent intra-abdominal free fluid. A positive FAST in an unstable pelvic fracture patient changes operative sequence: laparotomy before or concurrent with pelvic hemorrhage control.

4. **Pelvic XR on the trauma bay stretcher** -- AP pelvis identifies major ring disruption, open-book pattern, vertical displacement. Not needed if proceeding directly to CT.

5. **Hemorrhage control decision algorithm** (hemodynamically unstable despite binder + transfusion):
   - Positive FAST: emergent laparotomy (address intra-abdominal source first)
   - Negative FAST: angioembolization (if available within 30-60 min) OR preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) OR REBOA (Zone 3, infrarenal) as bridge to definitive hemorrhage control
   - Institutional protocols vary: angioembolization-first vs PPP-first. PPP addresses venous bleeding (80-90% of hemorrhage source) more directly; angioembolization addresses arterial bleeding.

6. **Assess for associated injuries** -- urethral (blood at meatus, do NOT place Foley until retrograde urethrogram if blood present), bladder (gross hematuria), rectal (rectal exam for blood, open fracture communication), vaginal laceration (open pelvic fracture), nerve injury (L5, S1 roots).

7. **Activate trauma surgery, orthopedic surgery, and interventional radiology** simultaneously. Pelvic fracture hemorrhage management requires multidisciplinary coordination.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Hip fracture/dislocation | Femoral neck or intertrochanteric fracture; XR shows femoral (not pelvic ring) pathology; lower hemorrhage risk |
| Acetabular fracture (isolated) | May be concurrent with pelvic ring injury; CT defines acetabular columns; lower hemorrhage risk if ring intact |
| Retroperitoneal hemorrhage (non-pelvic) | Renal injury, aortic injury, lumbar spine fracture; CT differentiates source; pelvic ring intact on imaging |
| Intra-abdominal hemorrhage (splenic, hepatic) | FAST positive, but pelvic ring intact on XR; CT defines solid organ injury |
| Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm | Older patient, no trauma mechanism, pulsatile abdominal mass; CT angiography diagnostic |
| Lumbar spine fracture | Adjacent anatomy, may coexist; imaging differentiates; neurologic deficits may overlap |
| Insufficiency fracture (sacral) | Elderly/osteoporotic patient, low-energy mechanism, sacral alar fracture on CT/MRI, minimal hemorrhage |

## Workup

**Immediate (during primary survey):**
- AP pelvic XR -- identifies symphysis diastasis, sacroiliac disruption, ramus fractures, vertical displacement
- FAST exam -- free fluid in abdomen/pelvis (concurrent hollow or solid organ injury in 15-20%)
- POC lactate, VBG/ABG -- base deficit guides resuscitation; base deficit worse than -6 mEq/L predicts significant hemorrhage
- Type and crossmatch -- send immediately, transfuse uncrossmatched O-neg (females of childbearing age) or O-pos before results

**Labs:**
- CBC (serial q30-60 min in active hemorrhage; initial hemoglobin unreliable)
- Coagulation panel: INR, PTT, fibrinogen
- BMP -- potassium (massive transfusion), creatinine, bicarbonate
- Ionized calcium -- replace aggressively during massive transfusion (calcium chloride 1 g IV per 4 units blood products)
- Urinalysis -- gross hematuria suggests bladder or renal injury
- TEG/ROTEM if available -- guides targeted component therapy
- Pregnancy test -- all females of childbearing age

**Imaging (hemodynamically stabilized or improving):**
- CT pelvis with IV contrast -- defines fracture pattern, identifies active arterial extravasation (contrast blush), retroperitoneal hematoma size, associated injuries
- CT cystogram -- if bladder injury suspected (gross hematuria + pelvic fracture); retrograde fill with 300 mL dilute contrast via Foley
- Retrograde urethrogram -- before Foley placement if blood at meatus; inject 20-30 mL water-soluble contrast via catheter-tip syringe at the meatus under fluoroscopy
- CT angiography of pelvis -- active extravasation identifies candidates for angioembolization

**Do NOT send hemodynamically unstable patients to CT.** AP pelvic XR + FAST guides initial management. CT is for the improving or stabilized patient.

## Treatment

**Pelvic Binder:**
- Apply circumferential compression device at the level of the greater trochanters (NOT the iliac crests)
- Commercial devices (T-POD, SAM Pelvic Sling) preferred; bedsheet wrap is acceptable alternative
- Reduces pelvic volume by closing the "open book"
- Most effective for APC-type injuries; may worsen LC-type injuries with overlapping fragments (rare in practice; apply empirically and reassess after imaging)
- Leave binder in place until definitive fixation or IR confirms hemorrhage control
- Skin checks q2h -- pressure necrosis risk with prolonged application

**Hemorrhage Control:**

*Angioembolization:*
- Indicated for arterial hemorrhage (contrast blush on CT, ongoing transfusion requirement despite binder)
- Selective embolization of internal iliac artery branches preferred
- Non-selective bilateral internal iliac embolization for diffuse bleeding (higher complication rate: gluteal necrosis, impotence)
- Effective for arterial bleeding; does NOT control venous hemorrhage

*Preperitoneal Pelvic Packing (PPP):*
- Suprapubic midline incision, blunt dissection to preperitoneal space, pack 3 laparotomy pads per side against the pelvic brim
- Tamponades venous hemorrhage from presacral plexus and cancellous bone
- Faster than angioembolization (can be performed in OR or trauma bay)
- Does not require IR availability
- Combined with pelvic binder for maximum effect
- Planned re-exploration and pack removal at 24-48 hours

*REBOA (Resuscitative Endovascular Balloon Occlusion of the Aorta):*
- Zone 3 deployment (infrarenal aorta, above aortic bifurcation) for pelvic hemorrhage
- Bridge to definitive hemorrhage control (angioembolization, PPP, or surgery)
- Femoral artery access (common femoral artery, 7-Fr sheath)
- Maximum inflation time: 60-90 minutes (ischemia-reperfusion injury to lower extremities)
- Does NOT treat the hemorrhage source -- buys time only

*External Fixation (emergent):*
- Anterior frame (iliac crest or supra-acetabular pins) provides temporary mechanical stability
- Largely supplanted by pelvic binder for initial stabilization in ED
- Still used in OR as bridge to definitive fixation

**Resuscitation:**
- Limit crystalloid to 1 L maximum, then blood products
- Permissive hypotension: target SBP 80-90 mmHg until hemorrhage control (exception: concomitant TBI requires SBP >100)
- Calcium chloride 1 g IV per 4 units blood products (citrate chelation)
- Cryoprecipitate 10 units if fibrinogen <150 mg/dL
- Correct hypothermia aggressively: rapid infuser with in-line warmer, forced-air warming blankets, warm resuscitation bay

**Open Pelvic Fracture:**
- Wound communicating with fracture or perineal/rectal laceration
- Mortality 30-50%
- Fecal diversion (diverting colostomy) if rectal injury
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV or cefazolin 2 g IV + metronidazole 500 mg IV
- Tetanus prophylaxis: Tdap if last booster >5 years; TIG 250 units IM if <3 prior doses or unknown history
- Emergent operative debridement and hemorrhage control

## Disposition

**Operating Room (emergent):**
- Hemodynamically unstable with positive FAST (laparotomy first, then pelvic hemorrhage control)
- Open pelvic fracture requiring debridement and fecal diversion
- Preperitoneal pelvic packing when angioembolization unavailable or patient too unstable for IR suite
- Failed REBOA or REBOA as bridge with ongoing hemorrhage

**Interventional Radiology (emergent/urgent):**
- Arterial contrast blush on CT in hemodynamically improving patient
- Ongoing transfusion requirement (>6 units pRBC in first 24 hours) despite pelvic binder
- Persistent hemorrhage after PPP (arterial source not controlled by packing)

**ICU Admission (all hemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures):**
- Ongoing massive transfusion and correction of lethal triad (hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy)
- Post-angioembolization or post-PPP monitoring
- Serial abdominal exams for abdominal compartment syndrome (bladder pressure >20 mmHg)
- Planned re-exploration at 24-48 hours for pack removal if PPP performed
- DVT prophylaxis once hemorrhage controlled (high VTE risk with pelvic fractures)

**Ward Admission:**
- Hemodynamically stable, mechanically stable fractures (Tile A, LC-I)
- Adequate pain control
- Serial neurovascular exams

**Transfer to Level I Trauma Center:**
- If orthopedic trauma surgery, interventional radiology, or trauma surgery not available
- Apply pelvic binder, initiate transfusion, start antibiotics if open fracture, transfer emergently

**Never discharge a hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patient from the ED.**

## Pitfalls

1. **Rocking the pelvis repeatedly on exam.** A single gentle AP compression/distraction test is sufficient to assess mechanical instability. Repeated pelvic rocking dislodges clot from the fracture surfaces and disrupted venous plexus, converting a tamponaded hemorrhage into active exsanguination. If imaging is imminent, skip the physical exam maneuver entirely.

2. **Delaying pelvic binder application until after imaging.** The pelvic binder should be applied empirically during the primary survey or prehospital phase based on mechanism and clinical suspicion. Waiting for XR or CT confirmation wastes time during active hemorrhage. A binder on a patient without a pelvic fracture is harmless. A missing binder on a patient with an open-book fracture is lethal.

3. **Placing the binder at the iliac crests instead of the greater trochanters.** The binder must be centered at the level of the greater trochanters to achieve effective reduction of the pelvic ring. Placement at the iliac crests does not close the pelvic ring and provides no hemorrhage control. This is the most common application error.

4. **Sending a hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patient to CT.** AP pelvic XR and FAST are adequate to guide initial management in the unstable patient. CT is reserved for the hemodynamically improving or stabilized patient. An unstable patient who arrests in the CT scanner has no therapeutic options available.

5. **Placing a Foley catheter when blood is present at the urethral meatus.** Blood at the meatus indicates urethral injury until proven otherwise (present in 5-10% of pelvic fractures, more common in males with APC-type injuries). A retrograde urethrogram must be performed before catheter insertion. Blind Foley placement through a disrupted urethra converts a partial tear to a complete tear and creates a false passage.

6. **Attributing all hemorrhage to the pelvis when the FAST is positive.** A positive FAST in a patient with a pelvic fracture means there is intra-abdominal free fluid -- likely splenic, hepatic, or mesenteric injury in addition to the pelvic fracture. The operative sequence changes: laparotomy to address the intra-abdominal source first (or concurrently), then pelvic hemorrhage control. Applying a binder and sending to IR while a ruptured spleen bleeds into the abdomen is a fatal error.

7. **Failing to activate multidisciplinary resources early.** Pelvic fracture hemorrhage management requires simultaneous mobilization of trauma surgery, orthopedic surgery, interventional radiology, blood bank (MTP activation), and ICU. Delayed activation of any one team creates bottlenecks. Activate all teams on arrival if mechanism and hemodynamics suggest significant pelvic injury.

8. **Assuming lateral compression fractures do not bleed.** LC-I fractures have the lowest hemorrhage risk, but LC-II and LC-III injuries can cause significant hemorrhage. The Young-Burgess classification predicts but does not guarantee hemorrhage volume. Any hemodynamically unstable pelvic fracture patient, regardless of fracture pattern, requires aggressive hemorrhage management.

9. **Forgetting to check for open pelvic fracture.** Perineal, vaginal, and rectal lacerations communicating with the fracture define an open pelvic fracture, which carries 30-50% mortality. A rectal exam and vaginal exam (in females) are mandatory in all pelvic fractures. Missed open fractures develop pelvic sepsis with devastating outcomes.

10. **Neglecting associated genitourinary injury.** Bladder rupture (intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal) occurs in 5-10% of pelvic fractures. Gross hematuria mandates CT cystogram. Extraperitoneal rupture is managed with Foley drainage; intraperitoneal rupture requires surgical repair. Missed bladder rupture leads to peritonitis and sepsis.
