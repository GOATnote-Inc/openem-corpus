# Hip Fracture

## Recognition

**Definition:** Fracture of the proximal femur, classified by anatomic location as femoral neck (intracapsular), intertrochanteric (extracapsular), or subtrochanteric. The most common fragility fracture in the elderly and the number one missed fracture on plain radiographs in older adults.

**ICD-10-CM Codes:**
- S72.009A — Fracture of unspecified part of neck of femur (femoral neck / intracapsular)
- S72.109A — Unspecified trochanteric fracture of femur (intertrochanteric / extracapsular)
- S72.23XA — Displaced subtrochanteric fracture of femur

**Classification by Anatomic Location:**

| Type | Location | Capsule | Key Concern | Typical Fixation |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Femoral neck | Between femoral head and trochanters | Intracapsular | AVN risk (disrupted medial circumflex femoral artery); nonunion | Nondisplaced: cannulated screws. Displaced in elderly: hemiarthroplasty or THA |
| Intertrochanteric | Between greater and lesser trochanters | Extracapsular | Blood loss (cancellous bone, extracapsular vessels); no AVN risk | Sliding hip screw or cephalomedullary (IM) nail |
| Subtrochanteric | Within 5 cm below lesser trochanter | Extracapsular | High stress zone; high nonunion rate; significant blood loss; bisphosphonate association | Cephalomedullary (IM) nail |

**Femoral Neck Fracture Grading (Garden Classification):**
- Garden I: Incomplete/impacted, valgus angulation (stable)
- Garden II: Complete, nondisplaced (stable)
- Garden III: Complete, partially displaced (unstable)
- Garden IV: Complete, fully displaced (unstable — highest AVN risk, 15-33%)

**Classic Presentation:**
- Elderly patient (mean age 80) after ground-level fall (standing height)
- Hip/groin pain with inability to bear weight
- Affected leg shortened and externally rotated (displaced fractures)
- Pain with axial loading and log-roll of the hip

**Occult Fractures (2-10% of hip fractures):**
- Normal or equivocal plain radiographs despite clinical suspicion
- Patient unable to bear weight with groin/hip pain after fall
- MRI is gold standard (sensitivity 99-100%, specificity 99%)
- CT sensitivity approximately 79% — inferior to MRI for nondisplaced fractures
- If MRI unavailable or contraindicated, CT with thin-cut coronal reformats is acceptable second-line

**High-Risk Populations:**
- Osteoporosis (postmenopausal women, men > 70)
- Chronic corticosteroid use
- Bisphosphonate-related atypical fractures (subtrochanteric, lateral cortex, transverse/short oblique pattern, cortical beaking — ask about bisphosphonate use > 3-5 years)
- Metastatic disease (pathologic fracture through lytic lesion)
- Chronic kidney disease (renal osteodystrophy)

## Critical Actions

1. **Obtain AP pelvis and cross-table lateral hip radiographs.** Standard AP pelvis alone misses fractures. A cross-table lateral or frog-leg lateral (if pain permits) is mandatory. Evaluate for cortical disruption, trabecular angulation, and Shenton line disruption.

2. **If X-rays negative but clinical suspicion high, obtain MRI.** Do not discharge elderly patients with hip pain and inability to bear weight after a fall with negative radiographs. MRI within 24 hours is the standard of care for suspected occult hip fracture.

3. **Provide early analgesia — fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB).**
   - Bupivacaine 0.25% 30-40 mL (or ropivacaine 0.375% 30-40 mL)
   - Landmark technique: 1 cm below junction of lateral 1/3 and medial 2/3 of inguinal ligament, two fascial "pops" (fascia lata, fascia iliaca)
   - Ultrasound-guided technique preferred when available (higher success rate)
   - Reduces opioid consumption, reduces delirium incidence
   - Alternative: femoral nerve block (less coverage of obturator nerve territory)

4. **Systemic analgesia as adjunct.** Acetaminophen 1 g IV/PO (15 mg/kg if < 50 kg). Low-dose IV opioids titrated to comfort (morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV or hydromorphone 0.25-0.5 mg IV). Avoid ketorolac in elderly with renal insufficiency.

5. **Notify orthopedic surgery early.** Time to OR within 24-48 hours of admission reduces mortality by 20-40%. Do not delay consultation for ancillary studies.

6. **Assess and correct coagulopathy.** Check INR, PTT, platelet count. Patients on warfarin: vitamin K 2.5-5 mg IV + 4-factor PCC (25-50 units/kg). Patients on DOACs: identify last dose, consider idarucizumab (dabigatran) or andexanet alfa (factor Xa inhibitors) for emergent cases. Coordinate with anesthesia and surgery for acceptable anticoagulation parameters.

7. **Initiate DVT prophylaxis.** Mechanical (pneumatic compression devices on contralateral leg) in ED. Chemical prophylaxis (LMWH or unfractionated heparin) per orthopedic protocol postoperatively unless contraindicated.

8. **Assess for delirium risk and implement prevention.** Avoid anticholinergic medications, minimize benzodiazepines, ensure orientation cues, adequate hydration, correct electrolyte abnormalities.

9. **Volume resuscitation.** Intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures can lose 1-2 units of blood into the thigh. Assess for occult hemorrhage. Type and screen on arrival.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Pubic ramus fracture | Tenderness over pubic symphysis/ramus, not groin; visible on AP pelvis; can bear weight (often); full passive hip ROM less painful |
| Greater trochanter avulsion | Isolated greater trochanter tenderness; can bear weight; X-ray shows trochanteric fragment without femoral neck/intertrochanteric involvement |
| Hip osteoarthritis flare | Chronic history, gradual onset, no acute trauma; X-ray shows joint space narrowing and osteophytes, no fracture line |
| Lumbar radiculopathy | Radiating pain below knee, dermatomal sensory loss, positive straight-leg raise; hip imaging normal |
| Femoral shaft fracture | Midshaft tenderness and deformity; fracture visible distal to subtrochanteric region on full-length femur film |
| Pelvic fracture (acetabular) | High-energy mechanism in young adults; pain with axial loading through femur; Judet views or CT pelvis diagnostic |
| Pathologic fracture through metastasis | Minimal trauma, lytic/blastic lesion on X-ray, known malignancy history |
| Hip dislocation | Posterior: hip flexed, internally rotated, adducted. Anterior: hip extended, externally rotated. Femoral head out of acetabulum on X-ray |
| Septic arthritis of hip | Fever, unable to bear weight, severely painful ROM in all directions; joint effusion on ultrasound; aspirate WBC > 50,000 |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- AP pelvis radiograph — evaluate both hips, Shenton line continuity, trabecular pattern
- Cross-table lateral hip radiograph — essential for femoral neck fracture detection
- MRI hip (limited protocol: T1 coronal + STIR coronal) — for occult fractures; scan time < 15 minutes; sensitivity 99-100%
- CT hip with coronal reformats — if MRI unavailable or contraindicated (pacemaker, severe claustrophobia); sensitivity approximately 79%
- Full-length femur X-ray — if subtrochanteric fracture to evaluate for atypical bisphosphonate-related fracture pattern and to assess for ipsilateral femoral shaft pathology

**Labs:**
- CBC — baseline hemoglobin (anticipate 1-2 g/dL drop from blood loss)
- BMP — creatinine (renal dosing, contrast planning), potassium, glucose
- Coagulation studies — INR, PTT (anticoagulation status)
- Type and screen
- Urinalysis — preoperative requirement; UTI is common precipitant of falls in elderly
- ECG — preoperative cardiac risk assessment; rule out MI as cause of syncopal fall
- Troponin — if syncope preceded the fall or ECG abnormalities
- TSH, vitamin D, calcium — if pathologic fracture suspected or metabolic bone disease workup indicated

**Bedside:**
- Focused hip exam: log-roll test (gentle internal/external rotation of extended hip — pain suggests fracture), axial loading through heel
- Neurovascular exam of affected limb — document distal pulses, sensation, motor function
- Skin assessment — pressure injury risk (sacrum, heels); document pre-existing wounds

## Treatment

**Pain Management:**

*Fascia Iliaca Compartment Block (FICB) — first-line regional technique:*
- Drug: bupivacaine 0.25% (2.5 mg/mL), 30-40 mL total volume (max 2 mg/kg)
- Alternative: ropivacaine 0.375%, 30-40 mL (max 3 mg/kg)
- Landmark technique: identify ASIS and pubic tubercle, divide inguinal ligament into thirds, insert needle 1 cm below junction of lateral 1/3 and medial 2/3, advance through two fascial pops, aspirate, inject
- Ultrasound-guided: linear high-frequency probe placed at inguinal crease, identify fascia iliaca deep to sartorius/iliopsoas, advance needle in-plane, hydrodissect under fascia iliaca
- Onset: 15-30 minutes. Duration: 6-12 hours (bupivacaine), 8-14 hours (ropivacaine)
- Blocks femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves; variable obturator coverage

*Systemic Analgesia:*
- Acetaminophen 1 g IV q6h (max 4 g/day in patients without hepatic impairment; max 2 g/day if > 65 years or < 50 kg per some institutional protocols)
- Morphine 0.05-0.1 mg/kg IV q2-4h PRN or hydromorphone 0.25-0.5 mg IV q3-4h PRN — titrate cautiously in elderly
- Avoid NSAIDs/ketorolac in elderly with renal insufficiency, heart failure, or anticoagulation
- Avoid meperidine — increased delirium risk in elderly

**Preoperative Management:**

*Anticoagulation Reversal:*
- Warfarin: vitamin K 2.5-5 mg IV (onset 6-12 hours) + 4-factor PCC 25-50 units/kg IV (immediate reversal) if INR > 1.5 and surgery planned within 24 hours
- Dabigatran: idarucizumab 5 g IV if last dose < 24 hours and emergent surgery required
- Rivaroxaban/apixaban: hold 48 hours if possible; andexanet alfa or 4-factor PCC 50 units/kg for emergent cases
- Antiplatelet agents: aspirin — continue through surgery; clopidogrel/ticagrelor — surgical delay vs. platelet transfusion is a risk-benefit discussion with orthopedics/anesthesia

*Volume Status and Resuscitation:*
- Intertrochanteric/subtrochanteric fractures: anticipate 500-1500 mL blood loss
- Target hemoglobin > 8 g/dL (liberal transfusion threshold of 10 g/dL in patients with cardiac disease is debated; FOCUS trial supports restrictive 8 g/dL threshold)
- IV crystalloid for euvolemia; avoid fluid overload in heart failure patients
- Type and screen; crossmatch 2 units pRBC for intertrochanteric/subtrochanteric fractures

*Delirium Prevention:*
- Avoid benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, meperidine, diphenhydramine
- Reorient frequently, ensure hearing aids and glasses are available
- Adequate pain control (FICB reduces delirium incidence vs. systemic opioids alone)
- Correct electrolytes, treat hypoxia, ensure adequate hydration

*VTE Prophylaxis:*
- Mechanical: intermittent pneumatic compression on admission
- Chemical: enoxaparin 40 mg SQ daily or unfractionated heparin 5000 units SQ q8-12h — timing per orthopedic/anesthesia protocol (typically start 12-24 hours postoperatively)
- Duration: minimum 10-14 days; extended prophylaxis up to 35 days per AAOS and ACCP guidelines

*Pre-Operative Traction:*
- Routine preoperative skin traction (Buck traction) is NOT recommended — no evidence of pain reduction or improved outcomes (AAOS moderate-strength recommendation against)

## Disposition

**All hip fractures require admission for operative management.**

**Surgical Timing:**
- Target: surgery within 24-48 hours of admission
- Each 12-hour delay beyond 48 hours increases 30-day mortality
- Delays beyond 48 hours associated with increased rates of pneumonia, pressure ulcers, DVT, and UTI
- Acceptable reasons for brief delay: active MI/ACS, acute decompensated heart failure, reversible coagulopathy requiring correction, acute pulmonary process

**Operative Approach by Fracture Type:**
- Femoral neck (nondisplaced, Garden I-II): cannulated screw fixation (in younger patients); may consider nonoperative with close follow-up in extremely high surgical risk patients
- Femoral neck (displaced, Garden III-IV): hemiarthroplasty (elderly, low-demand) or total hip arthroplasty (active elderly, pre-existing arthritis)
- Intertrochanteric: sliding hip screw (stable pattern) or cephalomedullary nail (unstable/reverse obliquity pattern)
- Subtrochanteric: cephalomedullary nail (long)

**Nonoperative Management (rare):**
- Reserved for patients with prohibitive surgical risk (terminal illness, bedbound at baseline, unable to tolerate any anesthesia)
- Comfort care pathway with pain management, DVT prophylaxis, early mobility as tolerated
- High mortality: 30-day mortality 17-25% without surgery

**Transfer:**
- Transfer to facility with orthopedic surgery and hip fracture surgical capability if not available locally
- Administer FICB, systemic analgesia, and initiate DVT prophylaxis before transfer
- Immobilize with pillow between legs; do not apply Buck traction for transport

## Pitfalls

1. **Discharging an elderly fall patient with hip pain and negative X-rays without MRI.** Hip fracture is the number one missed fracture in older adults. Occult fractures occur in 2-10% of patients with negative radiographs. Any elderly patient unable to bear weight after a fall with groin or hip pain requires MRI (or CT if MRI is unavailable) before discharge.

2. **Failing to obtain a cross-table lateral hip radiograph.** An AP pelvis alone misses a significant proportion of femoral neck fractures. The lateral view reveals displacement and angulation not visible on AP. Both views are the minimum standard.

3. **Underestimating blood loss in intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures.** These extracapsular fractures can bleed 500-1500 mL into the thigh with no visible external hemorrhage. Hemoglobin on arrival may be falsely normal due to hemoconcentration. Repeat hemoglobin at 6-8 hours. Type and screen all hip fracture patients on arrival.

4. **Inadequate pain management with systemic opioids alone.** IV opioid monotherapy in elderly hip fracture patients causes sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, and delirium while providing suboptimal analgesia. Fascia iliaca block is first-line — it reduces opioid requirements by 40-60% and decreases delirium incidence. Perform the block in the ED, do not defer to anesthesia.

5. **Delaying orthopedic consultation and surgical scheduling.** Surgery within 24-48 hours is the single most impactful modifiable factor for mortality reduction. Emergency physicians should notify orthopedics at the time of diagnosis and initiate preoperative workup simultaneously, not sequentially.

6. **Not asking about anticoagulation and bisphosphonate use.** Anticoagulation status directly affects surgical timing and may require reversal. Bisphosphonate use > 3-5 years is associated with atypical subtrochanteric fractures (lateral cortex origin, transverse pattern, cortical beaking). Missing this history delays appropriate workup (bilateral femur films) and fracture-specific management.

7. **Applying Buck traction routinely.** Preoperative skin traction does not reduce pain, does not improve fracture alignment, and does not improve surgical outcomes. The AAOS guideline recommends against routine preoperative traction. It wastes time, causes skin complications, and provides false reassurance.

8. **Missing the medical precipitant of the fall.** The fall itself may be the presentation of an acute medical event: syncope (cardiac arrhythmia, orthostatic hypotension), stroke, MI, sepsis, or medication adverse effect. Obtain an ECG on all elderly hip fracture patients. Check troponin if syncope is suspected. Evaluate for infection (UTI, pneumonia) as a fall precipitant.

9. **Ignoring delirium prevention.** Post-hip-fracture delirium occurs in 35-65% of elderly patients and independently increases mortality. Emergency physicians contribute to this risk by administering benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine, or meperidine. Use FICB for pain, acetaminophen as a scheduled adjunct, and low-dose opioids only as needed.

10. **Assuming a nondisplaced femoral neck fracture is benign.** Nondisplaced (Garden I-II) femoral neck fractures can displace with weight-bearing, converting a screw-fixable fracture into one requiring arthroplasty and dramatically increasing AVN risk. Strict non-weight-bearing and urgent orthopedic follow-up are mandatory even for "stable" patterns.
