# Acute Dystonic Reaction

## Recognition

**Definition:** involuntary sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal postures, typically occurring within 24-72 hours of starting or increasing a dopamine-blocking agent

**Common presentations:**
- **Torticollis:** sustained lateral neck rotation or flexion (most common)
- **Oculogyric crisis:** forced upward and lateral deviation of the eyes; sustained involuntary eye rolling
- **Trismus:** jaw clenching, inability to open mouth
- **Opisthotonus:** arching of the back
- **Tongue protrusion or buccal dystonia:** difficulty speaking, swallowing
- **Laryngeal dystonia:** stridor, airway compromise (EMERGENCY)

**Causative agents (dopamine receptor blockers):**
- First-generation antipsychotics: haloperidol (highest risk), droperidol, chlorpromazine
- Second-generation antipsychotics: risperidone, olanzapine (lower risk)
- Antiemetics: metoclopramide (very common cause), prochlorperazine, promethazine
- Rarely: aripiprazole, ziprasidone

**Risk factors:**
- Young age (< 30 years, especially young men)
- First-generation antipsychotic use
- High-potency agents (haloperidol > chlorpromazine)
- Recent dose increase
- Cocaine/stimulant use
- Prior dystonic reaction (high recurrence risk)
- No prior anticholinergic prophylaxis

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Identify the causative medication | At presentation |
| Administer anticholinergic agent | < 15 minutes |
| Assess airway if laryngeal dystonia | Immediately |
| Relief expected within 5-15 minutes | After IV diphenhydramine or benztropine |

1. **Assess airway** — laryngeal dystonia causes stridor and can obstruct the airway
2. **Administer anticholinergic IMMEDIATELY:**
   - **Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV/IM** (onset: 5 minutes IV, 15 minutes IM)
   - OR **benztropine 1-2 mg IV/IM** (onset: 5-10 minutes)
3. **Expect dramatic improvement within 5-15 minutes** — this is both diagnostic and therapeutic
4. **Identify and discontinue or adjust the causative agent**
5. **If no response in 15 minutes:** repeat anticholinergic dose; consider alternative diagnosis

## Differential Diagnosis

- Seizure (tonic posturing — but with loss of consciousness, post-ictal state)
- Tetanus (risus sardonicus, trismus, opisthotonos — but generalized rigidity, no medication history, wound)
- Strychnine poisoning (generalized spasms with clear sensorium)
- Meningitis (neck stiffness — but fever, altered mental status, no medication trigger)
- Cervical spine injury/dislocation (torticollis — but trauma history, focal neurologic deficits)
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (rigidity + fever + altered mental status + autonomic instability — more subacute)
- Serotonin syndrome (clonus, hyperreflexia, agitation — serotonergic medication)
- Stiff-person syndrome (progressive axial rigidity, antibodies)
- Conversion disorder/functional neurologic symptom (no medication trigger; inconsistent exam)
- Tardive dystonia (chronic, insidious onset after months-years of antipsychotic use — different from acute)

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — history of dopamine-blocking agent + characteristic posturing + rapid response to anticholinergic
- **No routine labs required** unless diagnosis is uncertain
- **If diagnosis uncertain:**
  - CK (rhabdomyolysis from prolonged spasm; NMS screening)
  - BMP (electrolytes)
  - Glucose (hypoglycemia can cause movement abnormalities)
  - Urine toxicology (cocaine, stimulants)
  - CT head (if first presentation without clear medication trigger — exclude structural lesion)

## Treatment

### First-Line (Anticholinergics)
- **Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV** (preferred for speed in ED; give over 1-2 minutes)
  - May repeat x 1 in 15-20 minutes if no response
  - If IM: 50 mg IM into deltoid
- **Benztropine 1-2 mg IV or IM** (alternative — longer duration of action)
  - May repeat x 1 in 15-20 minutes

### If Refractory (No Response After 2 Doses)
- **Diazepam 5-10 mg IV** (acts on GABA receptors to relax muscles)
- Reassess diagnosis — consider NMS, serotonin syndrome, seizure

### Laryngeal Dystonia (Airway Emergency)
- **Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV push** — may resolve stridor within minutes
- Prepare for intubation (difficulty expected due to laryngeal spasm)
- **IM epinephrine 0.3-0.5 mg** of 1:1000 is NOT standard for dystonia but may buy time for severe stridor
- Surgical airway kit at bedside

### Pediatric Dosing
- **Diphenhydramine 1.25 mg/kg IV/IM (max 50 mg)**
- **Benztropine:** not recommended for children < 3 years; age 3-12: 0.02-0.05 mg/kg IM/IV (max 1 mg)

### Post-Treatment and Prophylaxis
- **Oral diphenhydramine 25-50 mg PO TID x 48-72 hours** or **benztropine 1-2 mg PO BID x 48-72 hours** — prevents recurrence (medication half-life may exceed anticholinergic effect)
- Evaluate ongoing need for the causative medication
- If antipsychotic cannot be discontinued: switch to lower-risk agent + prophylactic benztropine 1-2 mg PO BID

## Disposition

- **Symptoms resolved after treatment:** Discharge with 48-72 hours of oral anticholinergic, strict return precautions, and outpatient psychiatric follow-up to adjust medications
- **Laryngeal dystonia:** observe 4-6 hours minimum after resolution; ensure oral anticholinergic tolerated before discharge
- **No response to anticholinergics:** admit for further evaluation (reconsider diagnosis)
- **All patients:** prescribing physician must be notified; medication reconciliation is essential

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosing acute dystonia as a seizure or psychogenic event.** Young patients presenting with torticollis or oculogyric crisis are frequently misdiagnosed. Ask about any new medication (including metoclopramide or prochlorperazine given in a recent ED visit or prescribed for nausea).

2. **Not giving anticholinergic prophylaxis when prescribing high-risk agents.** When haloperidol is given to a young patient (IM for agitation), co-administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IM or benztropine 1-2 mg IM to prevent dystonia.

3. **Discharging without oral anticholinergic for 48-72 hours.** The offending medication's half-life often exceeds the duration of the IV anticholinergic. Dystonia recurs in up to 20% of patients if no oral bridging medication is prescribed.

4. **Missing laryngeal dystonia as a cause of stridor.** Unexplained stridor in a patient on antipsychotics or antiemetics should prompt immediate IV diphenhydramine before pursuing imaging or airway intervention. The response is dramatic and diagnostic.

5. **Attributing medication-seeking behavior to the patient.** Acute dystonia is painful and terrifying. Patients may appear anxious and request immediate treatment. This is a genuine, painful medical emergency — not drug-seeking behavior.
