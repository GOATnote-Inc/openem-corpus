# Tumor Lysis Syndrome

## Recognition

**Definition:** Metabolic emergency from rapid lysis of malignant cells releasing intracellular contents (potassium, phosphorus, uric acid, nucleic acids) into the bloodstream, overwhelming renal excretion capacity.

**Cairo-Bishop Classification:**
- **Laboratory TLS:** 2 or more of the following within 3 days before or 7 days after cytotoxic therapy: uric acid ≥ 8 mg/dL (or 25% increase), potassium ≥ 6 mEq/L (or 25% increase), phosphorus ≥ 6.5 mg/dL in adults / ≥ 4.5 mg/dL in children (or 25% increase), calcium ≤ 7 mg/dL (or 25% decrease)
- **Clinical TLS:** laboratory TLS PLUS at least one of: creatinine ≥ 1.5x ULN, cardiac arrhythmia/sudden death, seizure

**Highest-Risk Malignancies:**
- Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia
- Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with WBC > 100,000
- Acute myeloid leukemia with WBC > 50,000
- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with bulky disease
- Any high-tumor-burden malignancy after chemotherapy initiation

**Spontaneous TLS:** Occurs without cytotoxic therapy in rapidly proliferating tumors. High tumor burden, elevated baseline LDH, and pre-existing renal impairment are risk factors.

**Presentation:**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy
- Muscle cramps, tetany, paresthesias (hypocalcemia)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia)
- Oliguria or anuria (AKI from uric acid/calcium phosphate crystal deposition)
- Seizures (hypocalcemia, uremia)
- Sudden cardiac arrest

## Critical Actions

1. **Check electrolytes immediately:** BMP, phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid, LDH, CBC. Repeat q4-6h during active TLS.
2. **ECG immediately** — peaked T waves, widened QRS (hyperkalemia); prolonged QTc (hypocalcemia).
3. **Treat hyperkalemia first** — most immediately lethal derangement. Calcium gluconate 10% 30 mL IV over 10 min (cardiac membrane stabilization ONLY if ECG changes present and no severe hyperphosphatemia), insulin 10 units regular IV + dextrose 50% 50 mL IV, sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq IV if acidotic, kayexalate 30 g PO/PR, emergent dialysis if refractory.
4. **Rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg IV (single dose)** for uric acid > 8 mg/dL or rapidly rising. Contraindicated in G6PD deficiency (causes methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia). Screen G6PD before use if possible; if unknown and life-threatening, give and monitor.
5. **Aggressive IV hydration:** NS at 200 mL/hr (adults) or 200 mL/m2/hr (pediatric), target urine output ≥ 2 mL/kg/hr. No potassium in fluids.
6. **Emergent nephrology consult for dialysis** if: potassium > 6 mEq/L refractory to medical management, phosphorus > 10 mg/dL, uric acid > 10 mg/dL despite rasburicase, volume overload, oliguric AKI, symptomatic hypocalcemia with concurrent hyperphosphatemia.
7. **Do NOT give calcium for asymptomatic hypocalcemia** when phosphorus is elevated — calcium phosphate precipitation worsens renal injury and causes tissue calcification.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Rhabdomyolysis | Muscle injury/crush, elevated CK (often > 10,000), myoglobinuria, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia overlap but uric acid is less prominent |
| Acute kidney injury (other causes) | No characteristic 4-electrolyte pattern; history/exam for prerenal, obstructive, nephrotoxic etiologies |
| Adrenal crisis | Hyperkalemia and hypotension, but hyponatremia predominates; low cortisol, no hyperphosphatemia/hyperuricemia |
| Malignant hypercalcemia | Hypercalcemia (opposite direction), typically solid tumors or myeloma, PTHrP-mediated |
| DKA | Hyperkalemia, AKI, but hyperglycemia, ketosis, metabolic acidosis with anion gap predominate |
| Massive hemolysis | Hyperkalemia, elevated LDH, but anemia, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, haptoglobin undetectable |

## Workup

**Immediate Labs:**
- BMP (K, Ca, BUN, Cr, glucose, CO2)
- Phosphorus, magnesium, uric acid
- LDH (tumor burden marker; often markedly elevated)
- CBC with differential (WBC count for risk stratification)
- Coagulation studies (DIC screening: PT, PTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer)
- Urinalysis (uric acid crystals, calcium phosphate crystals)
- ABG/VBG if acidotic

**Monitoring:**
- Electrolytes (K, Ca, Phos, uric acid) q4-6h during active TLS
- Strict I/O, Foley catheter, target UOP ≥ 2 mL/kg/hr
- Continuous telemetry
- G6PD level before rasburicase if time allows

**Imaging:**
- Renal ultrasound if oliguric/anuric (assess for obstruction, renal size)
- CXR if volume overload suspected

## Treatment

**Prevention (high-risk patients):**
- IV hydration: NS 200 mL/hr (adults), 200 mL/m2/hr (pediatric), start 24-48 hours before chemotherapy
- Allopurinol 300-800 mg/day PO in divided doses (start 1-2 days before chemo, blocks new uric acid formation but does not reduce existing uric acid)
- Rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg IV (single dose) for high-risk patients — converts uric acid to allantoin (soluble, renally excreted). Contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. Do NOT use allopurinol and rasburicase together (allopurinol blocks the substrate rasburicase acts on).

**Active TLS Treatment:**

*Hyperuricemia:*
- Rasburicase 0.2 mg/kg IV (single dose) — uric acid drops within 4 hours. Keep blood samples on ice (rasburicase degrades uric acid in vitro, falsely low results)
- If rasburicase contraindicated: allopurinol 800 mg PO load then 300-600 mg/day + aggressive hydration + urinary alkalinization (sodium bicarbonate 50-100 mEq/L in IV fluids, target urine pH 6.5-7.0). Do NOT alkalinize urine if hyperphosphatemia present (promotes calcium phosphate crystallization)

*Hyperkalemia:*
- Calcium gluconate 10% 30 mL IV over 10 min (membrane stabilization) — ONLY if ECG changes AND no severe hyperphosphatemia
- Insulin 10 units regular IV + D50 50 mL IV (shift potassium intracellularly)
- Sodium bicarbonate 50-150 mEq IV if metabolic acidosis
- Albuterol 10-20 mg nebulized (adjunctive)
- Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (kayexalate) 30 g PO or 50 g PR (slow, onset 1-2 hours)
- Patiromer 8.4 g PO or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate 10 g PO (newer binders)
- Emergent hemodialysis if K > 6.5 mEq/L refractory to medical therapy or ECG changes persist

*Hyperphosphatemia:*
- Aluminum hydroxide 300-600 mg PO q6h or sevelamer 800-1600 mg PO TID (phosphate binders)
- Aggressive hydration to promote renal excretion
- Hemodialysis for phosphorus > 10 mg/dL or refractory

*Hypocalcemia:*
- Treat ONLY if symptomatic (tetany, seizures, QTc prolongation with hemodynamic compromise, or life-threatening arrhythmia)
- Calcium gluconate 10% 10-20 mL IV over 10 min (repeat as needed)
- Asymptomatic hypocalcemia with hyperphosphatemia: do NOT replace calcium — calcium phosphate precipitation causes fatal renal and tissue calcification
- Correct hyperphosphatemia first; calcium will self-correct

## Disposition

**ICU Admission:**
- Clinical TLS (arrhythmia, seizure, AKI)
- Potassium > 6 mEq/L or rising despite treatment
- Phosphorus > 10 mg/dL
- Creatinine rising or oliguria
- Need for emergent hemodialysis
- Active cardiac arrhythmia
- Post-rasburicase monitoring in G6PD-unknown patients

**Oncology Floor/Step-Down:**
- Laboratory TLS without clinical manifestations
- Electrolyte derangements responding to medical management
- Adequate urine output on IV hydration

**Consults:**
- Nephrology (early) — for dialysis planning; do not wait for refractory hyperkalemia
- Oncology — coordinate chemotherapy timing, tumor burden assessment
- ICU — for hemodynamic instability or arrhythmia management

## Pitfalls

1. **Giving calcium for asymptomatic hypocalcemia when phosphorus is elevated.** Calcium phosphate product > 60 causes precipitation in renal tubules, soft tissues, and vasculature. Correct phosphorus first; calcium normalizes as phosphorus clears. Reserve calcium only for life-threatening arrhythmia or seizure.

2. **Giving rasburicase to a patient with G6PD deficiency.** Rasburicase generates hydrogen peroxide as a byproduct. G6PD-deficient patients cannot neutralize it, resulting in methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia. G6PD deficiency prevalence: 10-14% in African American males. Screen before use. If G6PD unknown and TLS is life-threatening, give rasburicase and monitor methemoglobin levels and hemoglobin closely.

3. **Alkalinizing urine when hyperphosphatemia is present.** Sodium bicarbonate in IV fluids raises urine pH, which promotes calcium phosphate crystallization in renal tubules. Urinary alkalinization is indicated for uric acid nephropathy but contraindicated when phosphorus is elevated. Check phosphorus before starting bicarbonate drips.

4. **Failing to recognize spontaneous TLS.** TLS does not require chemotherapy initiation. Patients with bulky Burkitt lymphoma, ALL with high WBC, or rapidly growing solid tumors (rare) can present with spontaneous TLS. Any cancer patient with unexplained AKI, hyperkalemia, or hyperuricemia should be evaluated for TLS.

5. **Using allopurinol alone for established hyperuricemia.** Allopurinol blocks xanthine oxidase and prevents new uric acid formation but does NOT reduce existing uric acid levels. Rasburicase enzymatically degrades existing uric acid and is the treatment of choice for established hyperuricemia (uric acid > 8 mg/dL). Allopurinol is for prevention, not acute treatment.

6. **Not repeating electrolytes frequently enough.** TLS electrolyte shifts are rapid and unpredictable. A normal potassium at presentation can become fatal within hours of chemotherapy initiation. Monitor K, Ca, Phos, uric acid q4-6h during the risk window (24 hours before to 7 days after cytotoxic therapy).

7. **Delaying nephrology consult and dialysis.** Hemodialysis is the definitive treatment for refractory hyperkalemia, severe hyperphosphatemia, volume overload, and oliguric AKI in TLS. Early nephrology involvement allows dialysis catheter placement before the patient decompensates. Do not wait for cardiac arrest to call nephrology.

8. **Forgetting to keep rasburicase blood samples on ice.** Rasburicase continues to degrade uric acid in vitro at room temperature, producing falsely low uric acid values. Samples must be drawn into pre-chilled heparinized tubes and kept on ice, analyzed within 4 hours. A falsely reassuring uric acid level delays treatment.

9. **Treating hyperkalemia with calcium in the setting of severe hyperphosphatemia.** The standard hyperkalemia protocol starts with calcium for membrane stabilization, but in TLS with concurrent hyperphosphatemia (calcium-phosphate product > 60), IV calcium can trigger widespread calcium phosphate deposition. Use insulin/dextrose and dialysis as first-line potassium-lowering strategies instead.
