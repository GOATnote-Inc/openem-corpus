# Erythema Multiforme

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- **Typical target lesions:** Concentric rings with central dusky/vesicular zone, surrounded by pale edematous ring, then outer erythematous ring (3-zone pattern)
- Distribution: Symmetric, acral predominance (hands, feet, dorsal surfaces, elbows, knees)
- May involve palms and soles
- Lesions fixed (do not migrate, unlike urticaria)
- Acute onset over 3-5 days

**Classification:**
- **EM minor:** Typical targets, primarily on extremities, no or minimal mucosal involvement (< 1-2% BSA desquamation)
- **EM major:** Typical targets + mucosal involvement (oral, genital, conjunctival); BSA < 10%
- **Distinction from SJS:** EM has RAISED typical targets on extremities; SJS has FLAT atypical targets on trunk with mucosal desquamation

**Etiologies:**
- **Infections (90% of cases):**
  - Herpes simplex virus (most common trigger — HSV-1 and HSV-2)
  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae (especially in children)
  - Other: EBV, CMV, histoplasmosis, orf virus
- **Medications (10%):**
  - Antibiotics (sulfonamides, penicillins, cephalosporins)
  - Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine)
  - NSAIDs, allopurinol
- **Idiopathic (20-50% in some series)**

## Critical Actions

1. **Distinguish EM from SJS/TEN** — this determines management and prognosis
2. **Assess mucosal involvement** — oral, genital, conjunctival
3. **Calculate BSA of skin detachment** — > 10% suggests SJS; > 30% suggests TEN
4. **Identify and treat underlying trigger** — HSV (acyclovir), Mycoplasma (macrolide)
5. **If progressing toward SJS/TEN:** Stop all suspect medications immediately, transfer to burn center

## Differential Diagnosis

- Stevens-Johnson syndrome — flat atypical targets, truncal distribution, mucosal sloughing, drug-triggered
- Urticaria — migratory lesions (< 24 hours), pruritic, no central necrosis
- Urticarial vasculitis — purpuric urticaria lasting > 24 hours, skin biopsy distinguishes
- Bullous pemphigoid — elderly, tense blisters, positive DIF/IIF
- Fixed drug eruption — recurrent at same site, well-demarcated violaceous plaques
- Secondary syphilis — palmar rash, non-vesicular, positive RPR
- Lupus — malar rash, discoid lesions, ANA positive
- Viral exanthem — diffuse, non-targeted, systemic symptoms

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — typical target lesions in acral distribution are diagnostic
- **Skin biopsy** if diagnosis uncertain — interface dermatitis, keratinocyte necrosis, lymphocytic infiltrate
- **HSV testing:**
  - HSV PCR or culture from active labial/genital lesions
  - HSV serology (IgM/IgG) if no active lesions
- **Mycoplasma IgM** if respiratory symptoms or pediatric patient
- **CBC, BMP, hepatic panel** — if systemic involvement suspected
- **Chest X-ray** if Mycoplasma suspected
- **Medication history** — detailed review for new drugs in preceding 1-3 weeks

## Treatment

### EM Minor (Mild, Self-Limited)
- **Supportive care:** Antihistamines (cetirizine 10 mg PO daily or diphenhydramine 25-50 mg PO q6h PRN) for pruritus
- **Topical corticosteroids:** Triamcinolone 0.1% cream BID to affected areas
- **Pain:** Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h or ibuprofen 400-600 mg PO q6h

### EM Major (Mucosal Involvement)
- **IV fluids** if unable to tolerate PO due to oral mucosal involvement
- **Oral care:** Magic mouthwash (lidocaine 2%/diphenhydramine/aluminum-magnesium hydroxide) swish and spit q4-6h; viscous lidocaine 2% for oral lesions
- **Ophthalmology consultation** if conjunctival/corneal involvement
- **Systemic corticosteroids** remain controversial; may be used for severe mucosal EM: Prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day PO x 7-14 days (taper over 2-3 weeks)

### Treat the Trigger
- **HSV-associated EM:**
  - Acute: Valacyclovir 1000 mg PO BID x 7-10 days or acyclovir 400 mg PO 5 times/day x 7-10 days
  - Recurrent EM (> 3 episodes/year): Valacyclovir 500-1000 mg PO daily or acyclovir 400 mg PO BID x 6-12 months (suppressive therapy)
- **Mycoplasma-associated EM:**
  - Azithromycin 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg PO daily x 4 days
  - OR Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 7-14 days (adults)

### Suspect Medications
- Discontinue any potentially causative drug
- If progressing toward SJS/TEN, stop ALL non-essential medications

## Disposition

- **EM minor:** Discharge with outpatient follow-up in 1-2 weeks; return precautions for worsening skin involvement, mucosal symptoms, fever, difficulty swallowing
- **EM major:** Admit if unable to tolerate PO, extensive mucosal disease, ophthalmologic involvement, or diagnostic uncertainty (rule out SJS)
- **Transfer to burn center** if BSA involvement > 10% or concern for SJS/TEN
- **Dermatology referral** for all cases of EM major, recurrent EM, or diagnostic uncertainty
- **Isolation:** Standard precautions
- **Reportable:** Not a reportable disease

## Pitfalls

1. **Confusing EM with SJS/TEN.** EM has RAISED typical target lesions with acral predominance. SJS has FLAT atypical targets with truncal predominance and significant mucosal sloughing. The distinction is critical because SJS/TEN has 10-30% mortality and requires burn center care; EM is usually self-limited.

2. **Not looking for HSV as the trigger.** HSV is the most common cause of EM. Even if no active herpes lesions are visible, serologic testing should be performed. Suppressive antiviral therapy prevents recurrence.

3. **Using systemic corticosteroids reflexively.** Steroids are controversial in EM and contraindicated if infection is the trigger and untreated. If HSV is the cause, steroids without antiviral coverage may worsen the underlying infection.

4. **Missing Mycoplasma pneumoniae in the pediatric patient with EM and cough.** Mycoplasma-associated EM can cause severe mucosal disease (sometimes called "Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis" or MIRM). Check Mycoplasma IgM.

5. **Ignoring recurrent EM.** Patients with >= 3 episodes per year benefit from long-term suppressive antiviral therapy. Failure to start prophylaxis leads to repeated ED visits and progressive mucosal scarring.

6. **Not performing an ophthalmologic exam.** Ocular involvement in EM major can cause corneal ulceration, symblepharon, and permanent vision impairment. Slit lamp exam by ophthalmology is warranted for any conjunctival symptoms.
