# Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome

## Recognition

### Timeline of Withdrawal Symptoms

| Time After Last Drink | Syndrome | Features |
|---|---|---|
| 6-12 hours | Minor withdrawal | Tremor, anxiety, insomnia, diaphoresis, nausea, tachycardia, hypertension |
| 12-24 hours | Alcoholic hallucinosis | Visual, auditory, or tactile hallucinations with intact sensorium (patient knows hallucinations are not real) |
| 12-48 hours | Withdrawal seizures | Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, typically brief and self-limited; 1/3 progress to status if untreated |
| 48-96 hours | Delirium tremens | Altered sensorium, agitation, autonomic instability (fever, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis), hallucinations, global confusion |

### CIWA-Ar Score (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised)
10 items, maximum score 67:
- Nausea/vomiting (0-7)
- Tremor (0-7)
- Paroxysmal sweats (0-7)
- Anxiety (0-7)
- Agitation (0-7)
- Tactile disturbances (0-7)
- Auditory disturbances (0-7)
- Visual disturbances (0-7)
- Headache (0-4)
- Orientation/clouding of sensorium (0-4)

| CIWA-Ar Score | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| < 10 | Mild | Supportive care, monitor q4h |
| 10-18 | Moderate | Pharmacologic treatment, monitor q1-2h |
| > 18 | Severe | Aggressive pharmacologic treatment, continuous monitoring |

### Risk Factors for Severe Withdrawal / Delirium Tremens
- Prior delirium tremens or withdrawal seizures
- Prolonged heavy drinking (> 10 years, > 8 drinks/day)
- Concurrent medical illness (infection, trauma, surgery)
- Older age
- Elevated initial heart rate (> 120 bpm) or CIWA > 15 on presentation
- Last drink > 48 hours prior to presentation
- Low platelet count, concurrent liver disease

### Delirium Tremens — Red Flags
- Onset 48-96 hours after last drink (can be delayed up to 7 days)
- Profound autonomic instability: fever > 38.3C, tachycardia > 120, hypertension, diaphoresis
- Global confusion with fluctuating level of consciousness
- Agitation refractory to initial benzodiazepine dosing
- Duration 3-7 days without treatment; can last weeks in severe cases

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| CIWA-Ar scoring | On arrival, repeat hourly |
| Thiamine before glucose | Thiamine 500 mg IV before any glucose administration |
| Benzodiazepine or phenobarbital | Initiate within 30 minutes for CIWA >= 10 |
| Electrolyte repletion | Mg, K, phosphate — check and replete aggressively |
| Seizure prevention/treatment | Benzodiazepines are first-line |
| Monitor for delirium tremens | Serial assessment; anticipate at 48-96 hours |
| Exclude other diagnoses | CT head, infection workup, glucose, toxicology |

1. Administer thiamine 500 mg IV before any glucose-containing fluids
2. Score CIWA-Ar; initiate pharmacotherapy for CIWA >= 10
3. Draw labs: BMP (glucose, electrolytes), magnesium, phosphate, CBC, hepatic panel, lipase, lactate, ethanol level, urinalysis
4. Replete electrolytes: magnesium sulfate 2-4 g IV, potassium as needed, phosphate as needed
5. Exclude mimics: fingerstick glucose, CT head if AMS or seizure, infection workup if febrile
6. Initiate symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol or phenobarbital protocol
7. Continuously reassess with CIWA scoring

## Differential Diagnosis

- Hypoglycemia (fingerstick glucose — must exclude immediately)
- Intracranial hemorrhage (subdural hematoma common in alcoholics — CT head)
- Meningitis/encephalitis (fever, nuchal rigidity, altered mentation — LP if suspected)
- Hepatic encephalopathy (elevated ammonia, asterixis, known cirrhosis)
- Wernicke encephalopathy (confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia — treat empirically with thiamine)
- Sympathomimetic toxidrome (cocaine, methamphetamine — urine drug screen)
- Thyroid storm (fever, tachycardia, agitation — TSH)
- Sepsis (infection screening, lactate)
- Benzodiazepine or barbiturate withdrawal (similar timeline and symptoms)
- Serotonin syndrome (clonus, hyperreflexia, medication history)
- Status epilepticus from other causes (head injury, structural lesion, metabolic)

## Workup

- **Fingerstick glucose:** Immediate — exclude hypoglycemia. Do NOT give glucose until thiamine administered.
- **BMP:** Electrolytes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia), glucose, BUN/creatinine
- **Magnesium level:** Hypomagnesemia is near-universal; replete even if level is low-normal (intracellular depletion)
- **Phosphate level:** Hypophosphatemia common, especially with refeeding
- **CBC:** Thrombocytopenia (alcohol-related marrow suppression, hypersplenism), macrocytic anemia, leukocytosis (stress response vs. infection)
- **Hepatic panel:** AST/ALT (AST:ALT ratio > 2:1 suggests alcoholic liver disease), bilirubin, albumin
- **Lipase:** Alcoholic pancreatitis is common concurrent diagnosis
- **Ethanol level:** Confirms recent use, correlates with timeline; withdrawal can begin while ethanol level is still positive (falling level)
- **Lactate:** Sepsis screening
- **Urinalysis:** Infection, rhabdomyolysis (myoglobinuria)
- **CK:** If prolonged agitation, seizures, or immobilization (rhabdomyolysis risk)
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR if liver disease suspected (coagulopathy)
- **CT head without contrast:** If altered mental status, seizure (especially first-time or focal), head trauma, or focal neurological deficit. Alcoholics are at high risk for subdural hematoma.
- **Urine drug screen:** Coingestants, polysubstance use
- **Chest X-ray:** If fever (aspiration pneumonia, infection)

## Treatment

### Thiamine — Give First
- **Thiamine 500 mg IV in 100 mL NS over 30 minutes, daily x 3 days** (high-dose protocol for suspected or confirmed Wernicke encephalopathy)
- Minimum: thiamine 100 mg IV if low clinical suspicion for Wernicke
- ALWAYS administer before glucose-containing fluids — glucose metabolism consumes thiamine and can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy
- Oral thiamine absorption is unreliable in alcoholics; IV is required

### Benzodiazepine Protocol — Symptom-Triggered (Preferred)

**Diazepam (preferred — long half-life provides self-tapering effect):**
- CIWA 10-18: Diazepam 10 mg IV every 10-15 minutes until CIWA < 10
- CIWA > 18: Diazepam 20 mg IV every 10-15 minutes until CIWA < 10
- Reassess CIWA 1 hour after last dose, then q1-2h
- Maximum: no fixed ceiling in severe withdrawal — titrate to clinical effect

**Lorazepam (preferred if hepatic impairment or elderly — no active metabolites, no hepatic oxidation):**
- CIWA 10-18: Lorazepam 2 mg IV every 15-20 minutes until CIWA < 10
- CIWA > 18: Lorazepam 4 mg IV every 15-20 minutes until CIWA < 10
- Shorter half-life requires more frequent redosing

### Benzodiazepine-Resistant Withdrawal
Definition: > 40 mg diazepam (or equivalent) in first hour OR > 200 mg diazepam equivalent in 24 hours without clinical improvement.

Options:
- **Phenobarbital** (see below)
- **Propofol 5-80 mcg/kg/min IV infusion** — requires intubation and ICU
- **Dexmedetomidine 0.2-1.5 mcg/kg/hr IV** — adjunct only; does not prevent seizures or treat delirium tremens alone. Reduces benzodiazepine requirements.
- **Ketamine 0.15-0.5 mg/kg/hr IV** — emerging adjunct for refractory withdrawal

### Phenobarbital Protocol (Alternative or Adjunct)

**As primary agent:**
- Phenobarbital 260 mg IV over 15 minutes (loading dose)
- Repeat 130-260 mg IV every 15-30 minutes as needed for persistent symptoms
- Maximum loading: 15-20 mg/kg total
- Long half-life (80-120 hours) provides sustained coverage with less need for redosing
- Monitor respiratory status closely — risk of respiratory depression especially with concomitant benzodiazepines or ethanol

**As adjunct to benzodiazepines in refractory withdrawal:**
- Phenobarbital 130-260 mg IV when benzodiazepine requirements escalating
- Reduces benzodiazepine requirements, ICU length of stay

### Seizure Management
- **First-line:** Lorazepam 4 mg IV push; repeat once in 5 minutes if seizure persists
- **Prophylaxis:** Adequate benzodiazepine dosing prevents withdrawal seizures. Phenytoin is NOT effective for alcohol withdrawal seizures — do not use.
- **Status epilepticus:** Follow standard status protocol — lorazepam, then phenobarbital 20 mg/kg IV, then propofol or midazolam infusion with intubation
- Evaluate for other seizure causes: CT head (subdural hematoma), glucose, electrolytes

### Electrolyte Repletion
- **Magnesium sulfate 2-4 g IV** over 1 hour (even if serum Mg is normal — intracellular depletion is common); repeat PRN. Hypomagnesemia worsens seizure threshold and causes refractory hypokalemia.
- **Potassium:** Replete to K > 4.0 mEq/L; IV KCl 10-20 mEq/hr via central line (max 40 mEq/hr in critical hypokalemia with cardiac monitoring); oral 20-40 mEq q2-4h if mild. Correct magnesium first — hypokalemia is refractory until magnesium is repleted.
- **Phosphate:** Replete if < 2.0 mg/dL; potassium phosphate 15-30 mmol IV over 4-6 hours; monitor calcium (phosphate repletion can lower calcium).

### Supportive Care
- IV crystalloid for volume repletion (most patients are significantly dehydrated)
- Folate 1 mg IV or PO daily
- Multivitamin daily
- Quiet, well-lit environment to reduce agitation and hallucinations
- Seizure precautions: padded side rails, suction at bedside
- 1:1 sitter or continuous monitoring for severe withdrawal

## Disposition

| Severity | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Mild (CIWA < 10), no seizure, no comorbidities | ED observation 6-8 hours; discharge if improving, reliable follow-up, and outpatient detox plan |
| Moderate (CIWA 10-18), responsive to treatment | Admit to monitored bed (telemetry); symptom-triggered protocol |
| Severe (CIWA > 18) or history of DTs/seizures | ICU or step-down with continuous monitoring |
| Delirium tremens | ICU admission; may require intubation for airway protection or refractory agitation |
| Benzodiazepine-resistant withdrawal | ICU; phenobarbital or propofol infusion |
| Withdrawal seizure (first-time or recurrent) | Admit; CT head; continuous monitoring for 24+ hours |

### Discharge Criteria
- CIWA < 10 for >= 6 hours without pharmacotherapy
- Normal vital signs
- Tolerating PO
- No seizures
- Normal mental status
- Electrolytes corrected
- Reliable follow-up arranged (substance use treatment, primary care)
- Prescribe thiamine 100 mg PO daily and folate 1 mg PO daily on discharge

## Pitfalls

1. **Giving glucose before thiamine.** Glucose administration precipitates Wernicke encephalopathy in thiamine-depleted patients. Always administer thiamine 500 mg IV before glucose-containing fluids. This is non-negotiable in alcoholic patients.

2. **Using phenytoin for alcohol withdrawal seizures.** Phenytoin is ineffective for alcohol withdrawal seizures. Benzodiazepines are first-line and provide both seizure treatment and withdrawal prophylaxis.

3. **Under-dosing benzodiazepines.** Alcohol-dependent patients have cross-tolerance to benzodiazepines and require higher doses. Titrate to clinical effect, not to a fixed dose ceiling. Diazepam 200-300+ mg in 24 hours may be necessary in severe withdrawal.

4. **Not screening for subdural hematoma.** Alcoholic patients with altered mental status, seizures, or head trauma require CT head. Chronic alcoholism with cerebral atrophy and coagulopathy increases subdural hematoma risk. Do not attribute AMS solely to withdrawal without imaging.

5. **Missing concurrent infections.** Fever in alcohol withdrawal may represent delirium tremens, but aspiration pneumonia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, urinary tract infection, and meningitis must be excluded. Obtain appropriate cultures and imaging in febrile patients.

6. **Forgetting magnesium repletion.** Hypomagnesemia is nearly universal in chronic alcoholics and lowers seizure threshold. Replete magnesium empirically (2-4 g IV) even with a normal serum level. Hypokalemia will be refractory until magnesium is corrected.

7. **Relying on ethanol level to determine withdrawal risk.** Withdrawal can begin while ethanol is still detectable (falling level triggers withdrawal in dependent patients). A positive ethanol level does not exclude withdrawal. Treat the clinical syndrome.

8. **Using fixed-schedule benzodiazepine dosing instead of symptom-triggered.** Symptom-triggered dosing (based on CIWA scores) reduces total benzodiazepine use, shortens treatment duration, and decreases oversedation compared to fixed-schedule protocols. Use CIWA-guided dosing whenever feasible.

9. **Discharging after a single withdrawal seizure without adequate observation.** One-third of patients with a single alcohol withdrawal seizure will progress to additional seizures or delirium tremens if untreated. Observe for minimum 6-8 hours with CIWA monitoring and ensure adequate benzodiazepine loading before considering discharge.

10. **Not recognizing benzodiazepine-resistant withdrawal early.** If a patient has received > 40 mg diazepam equivalent in the first hour without improvement, escalate to phenobarbital. Delays increase ICU length of stay and complication rates. Identify and act on benzodiazepine resistance within the first 1-2 hours.
