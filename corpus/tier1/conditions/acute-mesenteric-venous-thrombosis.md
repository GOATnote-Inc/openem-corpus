# Acute Mesenteric Venous Thrombosis

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Insidious onset abdominal pain (days to weeks), often diffuse or periumbilical
- Pain out of proportion to physical exam (classic mesenteric ischemia feature)
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea (occasionally bloody)
- Abdominal distension
- Low-grade fever
- Late: peritonitis with rebound tenderness (indicates bowel infarction)

**Key distinguishing features from arterial mesenteric ischemia:**
- Slower onset (days vs hours)
- Younger patients
- More often associated with hypercoagulable states and local factors
- Better prognosis with early anticoagulation

**Risk factors:**
- Hypercoagulable states: Factor V Leiden, protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, myeloproliferative disorders (especially polycythemia vera, JAK2 mutation)
- Local factors: cirrhosis/portal hypertension, pancreatitis, abdominal malignancy, recent abdominal surgery
- Oral contraceptive use
- Inflammatory bowel disease

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| CT angiography | < 1 hour of suspicion |
| IV anticoagulation | Immediately after diagnosis |
| Surgical consult | < 2 hours |
| Lactate level | < 30 minutes |

1. **Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation** — crystalloid bolus 20-30 mL/kg; these patients are third-spacing
2. **CT angiography (arterial and venous phase)** — diagnostic study of choice. Look for thrombus in SMV/portal vein, bowel wall thickening, mesenteric edema, ascites, pneumatosis
3. **Initiate systemic anticoagulation immediately** — heparin 80 units/kg IV bolus, then 18 units/kg/hr infusion (target aPTT 60-80 sec). Do NOT withhold even if surgery anticipated (reduces clot propagation)
4. **NPO, NG tube decompression** if distended
5. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics** — piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV q6h or meropenem 1 g IV q8h (for potential bacterial translocation)
6. **Serial abdominal exams** q2-4h — development of peritonitis mandates surgical exploration
7. **Surgical consultation** — early involvement even if initially conservative management planned

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute mesenteric arterial ischemia (SMA embolism/thrombosis)** — more acute onset, atrial fibrillation risk factor, CT shows arterial filling defect
- **Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI)** — low-flow state (shock, vasopressors), diffuse ischemia without vessel occlusion
- **Small bowel obstruction** — dilated loops with transition point; no vascular occlusion on CT
- **Acute pancreatitis** — elevated lipase, peripancreatic fat stranding
- **Inflammatory bowel disease flare** — history of IBD, mucosal pattern on CT
- **Portal vein thrombosis** — may coexist with MVT; similar CT findings in portal system

## Workup

- **CT angiography (arterial + venous phase):** Gold standard. Sensitivity > 90% for MVT. Assess thrombus extent, bowel viability, portal system involvement.
- **Labs:** CBC (leukocytosis), BMP, lactate (elevated = bowel necrosis, but normal does NOT exclude ischemia), LFTs, lipase, coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT), D-dimer (elevated but nonspecific)
- **Hypercoagulability workup** (can be sent but do not delay treatment): Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C/S/antithrombin III levels, antiphospholipid antibodies, JAK2 mutation, homocysteine
- **Blood cultures:** If febrile or concern for septic pylephlebitis
- **Plain films:** Nonspecific; may show ileus pattern, bowel wall thickening, or pneumatosis in advanced disease

## Treatment

### Conservative Management (No Peritonitis)
- Systemic anticoagulation with UFH (see Critical Actions dosing)
- IV fluids, bowel rest, NG decompression
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics
- Serial abdominal exams and lactate monitoring
- Majority (70-80%) of acute MVT can be managed conservatively with anticoagulation alone

### Endovascular Therapy
- Consider catheter-directed thrombolysis (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy if clinical deterioration despite anticoagulation, in specialized centers
- Transjugular intrahepatic approach for portal/SMV thrombolysis

### Surgical Intervention
- **Indications:** Peritonitis, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, clinical deterioration despite anticoagulation
- Exploratory laparotomy with resection of nonviable bowel
- Second-look laparotomy at 24-48 hours recommended
- Continue anticoagulation perioperatively

### Transition to Oral Anticoagulation
- Switch to LMWH or DOAC (rivaroxaban 15 mg PO BID x 21 days, then 20 mg daily; or apixaban 10 mg PO BID x 7 days, then 5 mg BID) once tolerating oral intake
- Duration: 3-6 months for provoked MVT (reversible cause), indefinite for unprovoked or thrombophilia

## Disposition

- **ICU admission:** Peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, post-surgical, lactic acidosis
- **Surgical/monitored bed:** Stable MVT on anticoagulation with serial exams
- **Transfer criteria:** Facilities without vascular surgery, interventional radiology, or ICU capability
- **Never discharge:** Acute MVT requires inpatient anticoagulation and monitoring. Outpatient management only after stabilization and transition to oral anticoagulation.

## Pitfalls

1. **Ordering CT without venous phase.** Standard abdominal CT without contrast or arterial-phase-only CTA will miss mesenteric venous thrombosis. The venous phase (portal phase) is essential for visualizing thrombus in the SMV and portal vein. Specify "CT angiography with arterial AND venous phase."

2. **Relying on lactate to rule out mesenteric ischemia.** A normal lactate does NOT exclude mesenteric ischemia. Lactate rises late — only after bowel necrosis is established. Clinical suspicion and CT angiography drive the diagnosis, not lactate.

3. **Withholding anticoagulation because of concern for bleeding or potential surgery.** Early anticoagulation is the cornerstone of MVT treatment and reduces mortality. Even patients who ultimately need surgery benefit from preoperative heparin (reduces clot propagation and improves venous outflow). Surgical teams should be consulted, not used as a reason to delay anticoagulation.

4. **Failing to obtain hypercoagulability workup.** MVT is frequently the first presentation of an underlying thrombophilia. Missing this means missing an opportunity to prevent recurrence and guide anticoagulation duration. Send workup at presentation (some results are unreliable in acute thrombosis — repeat outpatient).

5. **Attributing abdominal pain to gastroenteritis in a young patient with risk factors.** MVT affects younger patients than arterial mesenteric ischemia. Vague abdominal pain with a hypercoagulable risk factor (OCP use, recent surgery, IBD, malignancy) warrants CT angiography.
