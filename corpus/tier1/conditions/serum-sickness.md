# Serum Sickness and Serum Sickness-Like Reaction

## Recognition

**Classic serum sickness (type III hypersensitivity — immune complex deposition):**
- Onset 7-14 days after exposure to foreign protein (antivenom, antithymocyte globulin, monoclonal antibodies, horse/rabbit-derived sera)
- Triad: fever, rash (urticarial or vasculitic), arthralgias/arthritis
- Lymphadenopathy
- May include glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, neuritis

**Serum sickness-like reaction (more common in clinical practice):**
- Onset 1-3 weeks after drug exposure (NO true immune complex deposition)
- Same triad: fever, rash, arthralgias
- Most common culprits: cefaclor (children), amoxicillin, TMP-SMX, penicillins, bupropion
- Biologics: rituximab, infliximab, omalizumab
- Self-limited; no renal or serious organ involvement

**Key features:**
- Rash: urticarial (most common), serpiginous erythema at margins of hands/feet/fingers ("serpiginous band"), morbilliform, or vasculitic purpura
- Polyarthralgia/polyarthritis — symmetric, migratory, large joints
- Fever — low-grade to moderate
- Pruritus — often prominent

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Identify and discontinue causative agent | Immediately |
| Assess for organ involvement | At presentation |
| Manage anaphylaxis risk | If biologics/antivenom are the cause |

1. **Discontinue the offending drug/agent**
2. **Assess for renal involvement** — urinalysis (hematuria, proteinuria), creatinine
3. **Assess for severe manifestations** — vasculitis (palpable purpura), glomerulonephritis, neuritis, myocarditis
4. **Differentiate from anaphylaxis** — serum sickness onset is delayed (days-weeks), not immediate
5. **Symptomatic treatment** — antihistamines, NSAIDs, corticosteroids for severe cases

## Differential Diagnosis

- Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) — onset 2-8 weeks, eosinophilia, organ involvement (liver, kidneys)
- Urticarial vasculitis (lesions > 24 hours, painful, residual hyperpigmentation)
- Viral exanthem (no temporal drug relationship, viral prodrome)
- Acute rheumatic fever (preceding streptococcal pharyngitis, Jones criteria)
- Reactive arthritis (post-infectious, asymmetric, HLA-B27 associated)
- Systemic lupus erythematosus (ANA positive, malar rash, chronicity)
- Kawasaki disease (children — fever > 5 days, conjunctivitis, mucositis, desquamation)
- Stevens-Johnson syndrome / TEN (mucosal involvement, skin sloughing, targetoid lesions)

## Workup

- **CBC with differential:** may show leukopenia or leukocytosis; eosinophilia possible; thrombocytopenia (rare)
- **ESR/CRP:** elevated
- **Complement levels (C3, C4):** low in true serum sickness (immune complex consumption); normal in serum sickness-like reaction
- **BMP:** creatinine (renal involvement)
- **Urinalysis:** hematuria, proteinuria (glomerulonephritis)
- **Liver function tests:** transaminitis (hepatic involvement, rare)
- **Skin biopsy** (if diagnosis uncertain): leukocytoclastic vasculitis with immune complex deposition on immunofluorescence (true serum sickness)
- **Blood cultures:** if infectious etiology cannot be excluded (fever + rash + arthralgia overlap)

## Treatment

### Mild (Rash, Arthralgias, Low-Grade Fever — No Organ Involvement)
- **Discontinue offending agent**
- **Cetirizine 10 mg PO daily** or **diphenhydramine 25-50 mg PO q6h** for urticaria/pruritus
- **Ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6h** or **naproxen 500 mg PO BID** for arthralgias
- Self-limited; resolves within 1-3 weeks after drug discontinuation

### Moderate (Significant Arthritis, Extensive Rash, Moderate Fever)
- **Prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day PO (max 60 mg)** — taper over 2-3 weeks
- Antihistamines and NSAIDs as above
- Closely monitor for organ involvement

### Severe (Vasculitis, Glomerulonephritis, Neuritis, Myocarditis)
- **Methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg IV daily (max 125 mg)** for 3 days, then oral prednisone taper
- **Nephrology consultation** for glomerulonephritis
- **Rheumatology consultation** for vasculitis management
- IV hydration for renal protection

### Pediatric Dosing
- **Cetirizine:** age 2-5: 2.5 mg PO daily; age 6-11: 5 mg PO daily; age >= 12: 10 mg PO daily
- **Ibuprofen:** 10 mg/kg PO q6-8h (max 40 mg/kg/day)
- **Prednisolone:** 1-2 mg/kg/day PO (max 60 mg) in moderate/severe cases

## Disposition

- **Mild (rash, arthralgias, no organ involvement):** Discharge with medication discontinuation, antihistamines, NSAIDs; PCP follow-up in 3-5 days
- **Moderate (requiring corticosteroids):** Discharge with prednisone taper; PCP or allergy follow-up in 1 week
- **Severe (renal, neurologic, or cardiac involvement):** Admission for IV steroids, specialty consultation, monitoring
- **All patients:** document drug allergy; allergen avoidance counseling; advise that re-exposure can cause accelerated reaction (within 1-3 days)

## Pitfalls

1. **Confusing serum sickness with anaphylaxis.** Anaphylaxis occurs within minutes to hours of exposure; serum sickness occurs 7-14 days later. The treatments differ fundamentally. Serum sickness does not require epinephrine unless there is concurrent anaphylaxis.

2. **Not discontinuing the offending agent.** Symptoms will persist and potentially worsen if the causative drug is continued. Identify and stop the culprit medication immediately.

3. **Missing DRESS syndrome.** DRESS has a similar timeline but includes eosinophilia and visceral organ involvement (hepatitis, nephritis, pneumonitis). Check eosinophil count and liver function tests in any delayed drug hypersensitivity reaction.

4. **Dismissing the reaction as "just a drug rash."** Serum sickness with fever, arthralgias, and proteinuria indicates immune complex-mediated organ involvement that may require corticosteroids and monitoring. Not all drug reactions are benign.

5. **Failure to document the offending agent.** Re-exposure can cause accelerated serum sickness (onset 1-3 days) that is more severe. The drug must be recorded as an allergy in the medical record and the patient educated about avoidance.
