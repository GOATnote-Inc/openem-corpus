# Orbital Cellulitis

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Unilateral periorbital swelling, erythema, warmth
- Proptosis (distinguishes orbital from preseptal cellulitis)
- Pain with extraocular movements (pathognomonic)
- Ophthalmoplegia, restricted gaze
- Decreased visual acuity, afferent pupillary defect (optic nerve compromise)
- Fever, malaise, elevated WBC

**Key distinguishing features from preseptal cellulitis:**
- Proptosis
- Painful or restricted extraocular movements
- Decreased vision
- Chemosis

**Common etiologies:**
- Contiguous spread from sinusitis (most common, especially ethmoid)
- Dental infection, dacryocystitis, skin infection
- Post-surgical, post-traumatic
- Organisms: Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobes, polymicrobial in older adults

## Critical Actions

1. **CT orbits and sinuses with contrast** — obtain immediately to confirm orbital involvement and rule out subperiosteal or orbital abscess, intracranial extension
2. **Start IV antibiotics within 1 hour** of suspected diagnosis
3. **Emergent ophthalmology consultation** — assess visual acuity, pupil reactivity, IOP, fundoscopy
4. **ENT consultation** if sinusitis is the source
5. **Monitor visual acuity and pupillary responses serially** (q2-4h) — deterioration mandates urgent surgical drainage
6. **Neurosurgery consultation** if intracranial extension (cavernous sinus thrombosis, epidural/subdural empyema, brain abscess)

## Differential Diagnosis

- Preseptal (periorbital) cellulitis — no proptosis, no EOM restriction, no vision loss
- Orbital pseudotumor (idiopathic orbital inflammation) — may mimic; bilateral or steroid-responsive
- Orbital tumor (rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma) — subacute course, less febrile
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis — bilateral findings, cranial nerve palsies (III, IV, V1, V2, VI)
- Thyroid ophthalmopathy — bilateral proptosis, lid retraction, painless EOM restriction
- Orbital foreign body — trauma history
- Mucormycosis — immunocompromised (DKA, neutropenia), black eschar on palate/turbinates
- Dacryocystitis — medial canthal mass, epiphora

## Workup

- **CT orbits and sinuses with IV contrast** — gold standard for diagnosis and staging (Chandler classification)
- **MRI orbits with contrast** — superior for soft tissue detail, cavernous sinus evaluation; obtain if intracranial extension suspected
- **CBC with differential, CRP, ESR, blood cultures**
- **Culture and sensitivity** from any abscess drainage
- **Visual acuity, color vision, pupil exam, IOP** — baseline and serial
- **Procalcitonin** if sepsis concern

## Treatment

### Empiric IV Antibiotics
- **Vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h** (MRSA coverage) PLUS
- **Ceftriaxone 2 g IV q12h** (gram-negative and streptococcal coverage) PLUS
- **Metronidazole 500 mg IV q8h** (anaerobic coverage, especially if dental or sinus source)

**Alternative:** Ampicillin-sulbactam 3 g IV q6h + vancomycin 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h

**Duration:** Minimum 2-3 weeks total (IV for 7-14 days, then oral step-down based on clinical response)

### Surgical Indications
- Subperiosteal abscess > 1 cm or with vision compromise
- Orbital abscess
- Clinical deterioration after 48 hours of IV antibiotics
- Intracranial extension
- Suspected anaerobic infection (gas on imaging)

### Adjunctive
- Nasal decongestants and saline irrigation if concurrent sinusitis
- Pain management with acetaminophen/NSAIDs; avoid corticosteroids until infection controlled

## Disposition

- **All orbital cellulitis patients:** Admit for IV antibiotics and serial visual assessments
- **ICU admission** if: intracranial extension, sepsis, cavernous sinus thrombosis
- **Ophthalmology follow-up** within 1 week of discharge
- **Transfer criteria:** Facilities without ophthalmology, ENT, and CT capability should transfer immediately
- **Isolation:** Standard precautions; no airborne isolation required
- **Reportable:** Not a reportable disease

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosing orbital cellulitis as preseptal cellulitis.** Any proptosis, EOM restriction, or vision change mandates CT and IV antibiotics. Oral antibiotics alone for true orbital cellulitis leads to vision loss and intracranial complications.

2. **Failing to obtain CT with contrast.** Non-contrast CT misses early abscess formation and subperiosteal collections. Contrast is essential.

3. **Not performing serial visual acuity checks.** Vision can deteriorate rapidly from optic nerve compression. Declining acuity or a new afferent pupillary defect is a surgical emergency — do not wait for repeat imaging.

4. **Missing intracranial complications.** Cavernous sinus thrombosis presents with bilateral orbital findings, cranial nerve palsies, and meningismus. Requires MRI/MRV and neurosurgical involvement.

5. **Inadequate anaerobic coverage.** Sinus-source orbital cellulitis often involves polymicrobial flora including anaerobes. Omitting metronidazole increases treatment failure risk.

6. **Missing mucormycosis in immunocompromised patients.** Diabetics in DKA or neutropenic patients with orbital cellulitis must be evaluated for invasive fungal sinusitis — requires urgent biopsy and amphotericin B.
