# Acute HIV Syndrome

## Recognition

**Presentation (2-4 weeks after exposure):**
- Fever (80-90% of cases) — most common symptom
- Fatigue, malaise
- Pharyngitis (non-exudative)
- Lymphadenopathy (generalized, symmetric)
- Rash — diffuse maculopapular, trunk > extremities; non-pruritic
- Myalgia, arthralgia
- Headache
- Mucocutaneous ulcers (oral, genital, esophageal)
- Night sweats, weight loss
- Diarrhea, nausea

**Severe presentations (suggest acute HIV):**
- Aseptic meningitis (5-10%)
- Oral/esophageal candidiasis
- Guillain-Barre-like syndrome
- Opportunistic infections (unusual at seroconversion but occur with very high viral loads)

**High-risk exposure history:**
- Unprotected sexual contact
- Needle-sharing (injection drug use)
- Occupational needlestick
- Men who have sex with men (MSM)
- History of recent STI

**Key clinical clue:** Mononucleosis-like illness with NEGATIVE heterophile antibody (Monospot) test

## Critical Actions

1. **Include HIV in the differential** for any mononucleosis-like or influenza-like illness in a patient with risk factors
2. **Order 4th-generation HIV Ag/Ab combination test** (detects p24 antigen + HIV-1/2 antibodies) — can be positive as early as 2 weeks post-exposure
3. **If initial test negative but suspicion high:** Order HIV RNA (viral load) — detectable 10-14 days post-exposure, before antibodies develop
4. **Refer immediately for ART initiation** — same-day ART recommended if diagnosis confirmed
5. **Screen for concurrent STIs** (syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, hepatitis B/C)
6. **Assess for need of OI prophylaxis** if CD4 count is very low

## Differential Diagnosis

- Infectious mononucleosis (EBV) — heterophile antibody positive, atypical lymphocytes
- CMV mononucleosis — similar to EBV, heterophile negative
- Influenza — seasonal, respiratory symptoms predominate
- Streptococcal pharyngitis — exudative, positive rapid strep
- Secondary syphilis — palmar/plantar rash, positive RPR/VDRL
- Acute hepatitis — jaundice, elevated transaminases
- Drug reaction — temporal relationship to new medication
- Toxoplasmosis — ring-enhancing brain lesions if immunosuppressed
- Acute COVID-19 — respiratory symptoms, anosmia

## Workup

- **4th-generation HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab combination immunoassay** (preferred initial test)
- **If Ag/Ab positive:** HIV-1/2 differentiation assay
- **If Ag/Ab negative but clinical suspicion high:** HIV-1 RNA (viral load, quantitative PCR) — most sensitive early test
- **If Ag/Ab indeterminate + RNA positive:** Acute HIV confirmed
- **CD4 count and CD4 percentage** — baseline for staging
- **HIV genotypic resistance testing** (before starting ART)
- **CBC with differential** — atypical lymphocytes, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia possible
- **BMP, hepatic panel** — baseline before ART
- **STI screening:** RPR/VDRL, GC/CT NAAT (pharyngeal, urogenital, rectal), HBsAg, HBsAb, HCV Ab
- **Urinalysis** — baseline renal function
- **Pregnancy test** in women of childbearing age (impacts ART selection)
- **Hepatitis B serologies** — coinfection affects treatment selection (tenofovir-based regimen preferred)

## Treatment

### Antiretroviral Therapy
- **Immediate ART initiation is recommended** (same-day or rapid-start ART)
- ART during acute infection reduces viral reservoir, preserves immune function, and prevents transmission
- **Preferred initial regimens (per DHHS Guidelines):**
  - Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Biktarvy) 1 tab PO daily
  - Dolutegravir/lamivudine (Dovato) 1 tab PO daily (only if HBV negative)
  - Dolutegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir (disoproxil or alafenamide)
- **Do NOT delay ART for resistance testing results** — modify regimen later if resistance detected
- Refer to HIV specialist for ongoing management within 1-2 weeks

### ED-Specific Considerations
- The ED role is diagnosis, initial stabilization, and urgent referral
- If rapid ART start program available, initiate before discharge
- If not available, expedited outpatient HIV clinic appointment within 1-3 days
- Provide PrEP counseling information for sexual/needle-sharing partners

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (If Within 72 Hours of Exposure)
- If patient presents within 72 hours of potential exposure and is HIV-negative:
- **PEP regimen:** Tenofovir DF 300 mg/emtricitabine 200 mg PO daily + dolutegravir 50 mg PO daily x 28 days

### Opportunistic Infection Prophylaxis
- CD4 < 200: TMP-SMX DS 1 tab PO daily (PCP prophylaxis)
- CD4 < 100 + positive Toxoplasma IgG: TMP-SMX DS 1 tab PO daily
- CD4 < 50: Azithromycin 1200 mg PO weekly (MAC prophylaxis)

## Disposition

- **Most patients discharge** with urgent HIV specialty referral (1-3 days)
- **Admit if:** Opportunistic infection, severe meningitis, inability to tolerate PO, suicidality related to new diagnosis
- **Isolation:** Standard precautions; blood/body fluid precautions
- **Reportable:** HIV/AIDS is reportable in ALL US states — report to state/local health department
- **Partner notification:** Offer assistance with partner notification services through public health department
- **Provide:** Written resources, hotline numbers, linkage to care coordinator

## Pitfalls

1. **Not considering acute HIV in the "mono-negative mononucleosis" presentation.** A mononucleosis-like illness with negative Monospot in a patient with risk factors should trigger HIV testing immediately.

2. **Relying on a negative standard antibody test to exclude acute HIV.** Antibodies may not develop for 2-4 weeks after infection. The 4th-generation Ag/Ab combination test detects p24 antigen earlier. If this is negative but clinical suspicion remains, order HIV RNA.

3. **Failing to test for HIV in the ED.** CDC recommends opt-out HIV screening for all patients aged 13-64 in healthcare settings. Many acute HIV infections are missed because testing is not performed.

4. **Delaying ART referral.** Same-day or rapid-start ART is the standard of care. Early treatment reduces the viral reservoir, preserves CD4 cells, and dramatically reduces transmission risk.

5. **Not screening for concurrent STIs.** Acute HIV frequently co-presents with other STIs (syphilis, GC, CT, HBV, HCV). A new HIV diagnosis is an indication for comprehensive STI screening.

6. **Missing the diagnosis because the patient does not disclose risk factors.** The presentation is nonspecific. HIV should be on the differential for any undifferentiated febrile illness with pharyngitis, rash, and lymphadenopathy — regardless of stated risk factors.
