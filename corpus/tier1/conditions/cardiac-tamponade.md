# Cardiac Tamponade

## Recognition

**Classic presentation (Beck's triad — present in < 40% of cases):**
- Hypotension
- Jugular venous distension (JVD)
- Muffled heart sounds

**Clinical signs:**
- Tachycardia (most sensitive early sign)
- Pulsus paradoxus > 10 mmHg (drop in SBP during inspiration)
- Electrical alternans on ECG (beat-to-beat alternating QRS amplitude)
- Low-voltage QRS complexes
- Tachypnea, dyspnea
- Narrowed pulse pressure
- Equalization of diastolic pressures (RA = RV diastolic = PA diastolic = PCWP)

**Etiologies to identify:**
- Traumatic: penetrating chest injury, blunt cardiac rupture, iatrogenic (post-catheterization, post-pacemaker)
- Medical: malignancy (lung, breast, lymphoma), uremia, viral/bacterial pericarditis, aortic dissection with retrograde hemorrhage, post-MI free wall rupture, autoimmune disease

**Bedside ultrasound findings (perform immediately):**
- Pericardial effusion (anechoic stripe surrounding heart)
- Right atrial diastolic collapse (most sensitive early sign)
- Right ventricular diastolic collapse (most specific sign)
- IVC plethora (dilated IVC > 2.1 cm without respiratory variation)
- Swinging heart motion within effusion

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Bedside echocardiography | < 5 minutes from presentation |
| Pericardiocentesis or thoracotomy | Immediate if hemodynamically unstable |
| Surgical consultation | At time of diagnosis |

1. **IV fluid resuscitation** NS 500-1000 mL IV bolus to augment preload (temporizing bridge only)
2. **Pericardiocentesis** using subxiphoid approach under ultrasound guidance: advance 18-gauge spinal needle at 15-30 degrees from skin, aimed toward left shoulder, aspirating continuously; removal of as little as 15-30 mL can produce hemodynamic improvement
3. **Emergent thoracotomy** for traumatic tamponade with cardiac arrest or peri-arrest: left anterolateral thoracotomy at 5th intercostal space, open pericardium anterior and parallel to the phrenic nerve
4. **Avoid positive pressure ventilation** — decreases venous return and worsens tamponade physiology; if intubation unavoidable, use ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV for induction to preserve sympathetic tone
5. **Avoid vasodilators, diuretics, and beta-blockers** — all worsen hemodynamics
6. **Vasopressors as bridge:** norepinephrine 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV if pericardiocentesis delayed
7. **Pericardial drain placement** after initial aspiration to prevent reaccumulation

## Differential Diagnosis

- Tension pneumothorax (absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation, hyperresonance — tamponade has normal breath sounds)
- Massive pulmonary embolism (RV dilation without pericardial effusion on ultrasound)
- Right ventricular MI (inferior ST elevation, RV dilation, clear pericardium)
- Constrictive pericarditis (chronic, thickened pericardium, calcification)
- Acute decompensated heart failure (dilated ventricles, reduced EF)
- Superior vena cava syndrome (facial/upper extremity edema, mediastinal mass)

## Workup

- **Point-of-care echocardiography:** First-line diagnostic study; perform immediately — do NOT delay for formal echo
- **ECG:** Low voltage, electrical alternans, sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST elevation if concurrent pericarditis
- **Chest X-ray:** Enlarged cardiac silhouette ("water bottle" shape); normal CXR does not exclude tamponade (acute hemorrhagic tamponade may accumulate < 200 mL)
- **CBC, BMP, coagulation studies, type and screen**
- **Troponin** if myocardial injury suspected
- **Blood cultures** if infectious etiology suspected
- **CT chest with contrast** only if patient hemodynamically stable and diagnosis uncertain
- **Send pericardial fluid** for cell count, protein, LDH, glucose, cytology, culture, acid-fast bacilli

## Treatment

### Hemodynamically Unstable (Obstructive Shock)
- **Pericardiocentesis** is definitive temporizing treatment; use ultrasound-guided subxiphoid approach
- Aspirate fluid until hemodynamics improve; leave pigtail catheter for ongoing drainage
- If pericardiocentesis fails or fluid is clotted blood: **emergent surgical pericardial window or thoracotomy**
- **Traumatic tamponade:** pericardiocentesis is a bridge; most require surgical repair of cardiac injury

### Hemodynamically Stable
- Admit for monitoring; serial echocardiography
- Treat underlying cause (dialysis for uremic, chemotherapy for malignant, antibiotics for bacterial)
- NSAIDs for inflammatory pericarditis: ibuprofen 600 mg PO TID + colchicine 0.5 mg PO BID
- Glucocorticoids only for autoimmune etiology or NSAID-refractory cases

### Resuscitation Adjuncts
- Norepinephrine 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min IV for vasopressor support
- Volume resuscitation with NS or LR 500-1000 mL boluses
- Atropine 0.5 mg IV for reflex bradycardia during pericardiocentesis (vagal response)

## Disposition

- **Hemodynamically unstable tamponade:** ICU admission after pericardiocentesis or surgical intervention
- **Traumatic tamponade:** Operating room for definitive surgical repair
- **Stable with pericardial drain in place:** ICU or step-down unit with serial echocardiography
- **Post-pericardiocentesis with resolved effusion:** Monitored bed for 24-48 hours minimum
- **Transfer:** If no cardiothoracic surgery available and patient requires operative intervention

## Pitfalls

1. **Relying on Beck's triad for diagnosis.** The full triad is present in a minority of cases. Tachycardia with JVD and hypotension should trigger bedside echo regardless of heart sound quality.

2. **Misinterpreting a "normal" chest X-ray as excluding tamponade.** Acute hemorrhagic tamponade (trauma, aortic dissection, free wall rupture) develops with as little as 150-200 mL of pericardial blood — insufficient to enlarge the cardiac silhouette on CXR.

3. **Initiating positive pressure ventilation before pericardiocentesis.** PPV reduces venous return and can precipitate cardiac arrest. If intubation is required, perform pericardiocentesis first or simultaneously. Use ketamine for induction to preserve sympathetic tone.

4. **Sending a hypotensive patient to CT instead of performing bedside ultrasound.** Tamponade is a bedside diagnosis. Unstable patients should not leave the resuscitation bay for imaging.

5. **Assuming traumatic tamponade can be definitively managed with needle pericardiocentesis alone.** Traumatic hemopericardium reaccumulates rapidly and often contains clotted blood that does not aspirate through a needle. These patients require surgical exploration.

6. **Administering diuretics for "heart failure" based on JVD and dyspnea.** Diuretics reduce preload and cause hemodynamic collapse in tamponade. JVD in tamponade is from impaired diastolic filling, not volume overload.

7. **Failure to evaluate for aortic dissection as the underlying cause.** Type A dissection with retrograde aortic root hemorrhage causes tamponade. Anticoagulation is lethal. Check for aortic regurgitation murmur, pulse deficits, and mediastinal widening.

8. **Stopping pericardiocentesis after initial improvement without placing a drain.** Effusions reaccumulate. Place a pigtail catheter and continue drainage until output < 25 mL/day.

9. **Missing low-pressure tamponade in hypovolemic patients.** Trauma patients with concurrent hemorrhage may not mount JVD or typical hemodynamic findings. Bedside echo is essential in all hypotensive trauma patients.
