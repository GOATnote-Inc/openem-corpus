# Esophageal Foreign Body / Button Battery Impaction

## Recognition

**Definition:** Esophageal foreign body impaction occurs when an ingested object lodges in the esophagus, causing obstruction, mucosal injury, or perforation. Button batteries are the most time-critical variant — they generate an electrical circuit against the esophageal mucosa, causing alkaline burns, liquefactive necrosis, and full-thickness perforation within 2 hours.

**Object-Specific Risk Stratification:**

| Object | Risk Level | Time to Harm | Action |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------|
| **Button battery (esophageal)** | Critical | Burns at 15 min, necrosis by 2h, perforation by 4-6h | Emergent endoscopy (< 2h) |
| **Sharp/pointed objects** | High | Perforation risk 15-35% | Endoscopy within 24h, emergent if symptomatic |
| **Magnets (multiple)** | High | Bowel necrosis from magnetic attraction across loops | Emergent if 2+ magnets or magnet + metal |
| **Food bolus** | Moderate | Complete obstruction causes aspiration risk, mucosal pressure necrosis | Endoscopy within 6-12h; emergent if unable to manage secretions |
| **Coins** | Low | Mucosal pressure erosion over days | Endoscopy within 24h if esophageal; observation if distal to esophagus |
| **Blunt objects < 6 cm** | Low | Usually pass spontaneously once past pylorus | Observe; serial X-rays |

**Sites of Esophageal Impaction:**
1. Upper esophageal sphincter / cricopharyngeus (most common in children)
2. Aortic arch level (mid-esophagus)
3. Lower esophageal sphincter / GE junction (most common in adults with food bolus)

**Clinical Features:**

| Feature | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Dysphagia / odynophagia** | Acute onset; localized to chest or throat |
| **Drooling / inability to swallow secretions** | Complete esophageal obstruction — aspiration risk |
| **Foreign body sensation** | "Something stuck in my throat" — localizes poorly |
| **Vomiting / retching** | Especially with food bolus |
| **Stridor / respiratory distress** | Posterior tracheal compression by large esophageal foreign body |
| **Chest/neck pain** | Suggests mucosal injury or perforation |
| **Subcutaneous emphysema** | Crepitus in neck/chest — perforation |
| **Hematemesis** | Mucosal erosion or vascular injury (button battery) |

**Button Battery Emergencies:**
- Lithium coin cells (≥ 20 mm, 3V) are most dangerous — 20 mm cells lodge in pediatric esophagus
- External current generates hydroxide (OH⁻) at negative pole → alkaline tissue destruction
- Injury mechanism is electrochemical, NOT pressure or acid leakage
- Damage continues after battery removal (delayed perforation up to 28 days post-removal)
- Aortoesophageal fistula is the fatal complication (delayed hemorrhage)

## Critical Actions

1. **Immediate AP and lateral X-rays (neck, chest, abdomen).** Identifies location, number, and type of objects. Button batteries appear as a "double-density" or "halo" sign on AP view (step-off at junction of anode and cathode). Coins appear as a uniform single disk. Multiple magnets may be overlapping.

2. **Button battery in esophagus = emergent endoscopy within 2 hours.** Do not delay for NPO requirements. Do not attempt medical dissolution. Do not attempt balloon catheter extraction (risk of aspiration and further mucosal damage). Pre-removal: instill honey 10 mL PO q10 min (if child > 12 months and < 12 hours since ingestion, only until arrival at endoscopy) — creates a protective viscous barrier that reduces ongoing tissue damage.

3. **NPO for all patients with esophageal foreign bodies requiring endoscopy.** Exception: button battery — do not delay endoscopy for NPO time. Exception: honey for button battery (above).

4. **GI consultation for endoscopic removal.** Flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the procedure of choice. Rigid esophagoscopy for large objects or failed flexible approach.

5. **For food bolus impaction: attempt glucagon 1 mg IV push before endoscopy** (relaxes lower esophageal sphincter). If no passage in 30 minutes, proceed to endoscopy. Glucagon efficacy is modest (success rate ~12-50%). Do NOT use meat tenderizer (papain) — causes perforations.

6. **For complete obstruction (unable to manage secretions): continuous suctioning of oropharynx, left lateral decubitus position, prepare for emergent endoscopy.** Aspiration risk is immediate.

7. **If signs of perforation (subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal air, hemodynamic instability): surgical consultation in addition to GI.** CT neck/chest with IV contrast to evaluate perforation extent. Broad-spectrum antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h.

8. **Post-button battery removal surveillance.** Obtain CT angiography if battery was esophageal for > 2 hours or if necrosis is seen at removal. Monitor for delayed aortoesophageal fistula (sentinel bleed → massive hemorrhage) for up to 28 days. NPO with IV fluids post-removal; gradual feeding advancement after repeat imaging.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Esophageal stricture** | Recurrent food impaction; history of caustic ingestion, radiation, eosinophilic esophagitis; no discrete foreign body on imaging |
| **Esophageal malignancy** | Progressive dysphagia (solids then liquids); weight loss; older adult; mass on endoscopy |
| **Eosinophilic esophagitis** | Recurrent food impactions; young adult male; atopic history; rings/furrows on endoscopy; biopsy diagnostic (≥ 15 eos/HPF) |
| **Esophageal perforation (Boerhaave)** | Forceful vomiting, subcutaneous emphysema, severe chest pain; no foreign body history; left pleural effusion |
| **Retropharyngeal abscess** | Neck stiffness, drooling, fever; widened prevertebral space on lateral neck film; no radiopaque foreign body |
| **Peritonsillar abscess** | Trismus, uvular deviation, "hot potato" voice; no foreign body on imaging |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- AP and lateral X-ray: neck, chest, abdomen (single series) — identifies radiopaque objects, location, number
- CT neck/chest with IV contrast: if perforation suspected (subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal air); post-button battery removal to assess vascular proximity
- CT angiography: post-button battery removal if battery was lodged > 2 hours — assess for impending aortoesophageal fistula
- Hand-held metal detector: quick screening in pediatric coin ingestion (sensitivity ~95%)

**Laboratory:**
- CBC (leukocytosis if perforation/infection)
- BMP
- Type and screen (if perforation suspected or vascular injury possible)
- Coagulation studies (if surgical intervention anticipated)

**Endoscopy (diagnostic and therapeutic):**
- Flexible EGD: direct visualization, biopsy capability (e.g., for EoE), therapeutic removal
- Rigid esophagoscopy: large objects, failed flexible approach

## Treatment

**Button Battery (esophageal) — EMERGENT:**
- Honey 10 mL PO q10 min (age > 12 months; < 12 hours since ingestion; while awaiting endoscopy only)
- Emergent EGD removal within 2 hours of confirmed esophageal impaction
- Do NOT induce vomiting, use Foley balloon extraction, or give anything to dissolve battery
- Post-removal: inspect mucosa, document injury grade, obtain CT angiography if deep necrosis
- Admit all patients for observation ≥ 48 hours after esophageal button battery removal
- Monitor for delayed aortoesophageal fistula for 28 days (sentinel bleed protocol)

**Food Bolus:**
- Glucagon 1 mg IV push (may repeat once after 20 min) — smooth muscle relaxation
- Effervescent agents (carbonated beverages): anecdotal; avoid if complete obstruction
- EGD within 6-12 hours; emergent if complete obstruction (unable to manage secretions)
- Push technique (preferred) or extraction; biopsy esophageal mucosa for EoE (3+ biopsies from proximal and distal esophagus)

**Sharp/Pointed Objects:**
- Endoscopic removal within 24 hours; emergent if symptomatic
- Remove using cap-fitted endoscope to protect mucosa during extraction
- If object in stomach: remove endoscopically if > 6 cm long, > 2.5 cm diameter, or sharp
- Surgical removal if perforation or failed endoscopic retrieval

**Coins:**
- Esophageal: EGD removal within 24 hours; Foley balloon extraction by fluoroscopy is acceptable alternative in compliant children with smooth coins in upper esophagus < 24 hours
- Gastric: observation with serial X-rays; most pass within 1-2 weeks; endoscopy if retained > 4 weeks

**Multiple Magnets or Magnet + Metal:**
- Emergent endoscopic removal if in esophagus or stomach
- Surgical consultation for magnets beyond endoscopic reach with bowel-wall trapping

## Disposition

**Admit:**
- All esophageal button battery removals (minimum 48-hour observation)
- Esophageal perforation (surgical service)
- Failed endoscopic removal requiring operative intervention
- Sharp objects that have passed beyond endoscopic reach (serial imaging)

**Discharge:**
- Successful food bolus removal in otherwise healthy adult (ensure EoE biopsy results followed up)
- Coins in stomach (asymptomatic, reliable follow-up, return precautions)
- Blunt objects that have passed esophagus into stomach (< 6 cm; outpatient serial X-rays)

**Return precautions:** Fever, chest/abdominal pain, hematemesis, inability to swallow, subcutaneous emphysema

## Pitfalls

1. **Mistaking a button battery for a coin on X-ray.** On AP view, a button battery shows a double-density "halo" or "step-off" sign at the junction of the anode and cathode — a coin appears as a uniform single disk. On lateral view, the battery is narrower than a coin. Misidentification delays emergent removal and allows ongoing mucosal destruction. If uncertain: treat as battery.

2. **Delaying button battery removal for NPO status.** The 2-hour window for button battery esophageal removal takes precedence over aspiration risk from recent oral intake. Tissue necrosis, perforation, and aortoesophageal fistula are lethal complications that dwarf aspiration risk. Proceed with endoscopy immediately regardless of last meal time.

3. **Discharging a patient after button battery removal without surveillance imaging and observation.** Tissue damage from button batteries continues after removal (alkaline injury propagation). Aortoesophageal fistula can develop up to 28 days post-removal, presenting as a "sentinel bleed" (small hematemesis) followed by catastrophic hemorrhage hours later. All patients with esophageal battery impaction require admission and CT angiography.

4. **Failing to biopsy for eosinophilic esophagitis after food bolus removal.** EoE is the most common underlying cause of recurrent food bolus impaction in young adults. Failure to biopsy (≥ 6 biopsies from proximal and distal esophagus) at the time of EGD misses the diagnosis and guarantees recurrence. Biopsy is a zero-marginal-cost addition to an already-performed procedure.

5. **Using papain (meat tenderizer) for food bolus impaction.** Papain enzymatically digests tissue as effectively as it digests meat — case reports of esophageal perforation and mediastinitis from enzymatic dissolution of the esophageal wall. This agent is absolutely contraindicated. Glucagon is the only pharmacologic agent appropriate for food bolus.
