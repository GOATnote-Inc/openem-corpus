# Mastoiditis (Acute)

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute mastoiditis is infection and inflammation of the mastoid air cells, nearly always arising as a complication of acute otitis media (AOM). It represents the most common suppurative complication of AOM. The spectrum ranges from simple periostitis (inflammation of the mastoid periosteum without bone destruction) to coalescent mastoiditis (destruction of bony septa between air cells with abscess formation) to intracranial extension.

**Epidemiology:**
- Incidence: 1.2-6.1 per 100,000 children per year; approximately 0.24% of AOM episodes (1 in 400)
- Peak age: children < 2 years (median 12 months in most series)
- Most common suppurative complication of AOM
- Incidence has risen in some populations despite widespread antibiotic use, possibly related to increased antibiotic-resistant organisms and watchful waiting strategies for uncomplicated AOM

**Pathophysiology:**
- AOM causes inflammation and mucosal edema in the middle ear cleft, which communicates with the mastoid air cells via the aditus ad antrum
- Obstruction of drainage from the mastoid leads to accumulation of purulent material under pressure
- Progressive infection destroys the thin bony septa between air cells (coalescence)
- Erosion through the lateral cortex produces subperiosteal abscess
- Erosion through the medial cortex, tegmen tympani (roof), or posterior fossa plate leads to intracranial complications
- Erosion through the mastoid tip medial to the sternocleidomastoid attachment produces a Bezold abscess (deep neck abscess)

**Microbiology:**
- Streptococcus pneumoniae (most common overall, though declining with PCV13 vaccination)
- Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus -- increasingly prevalent, associated with aggressive disease and intracranial complications)
- Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)
- Haemophilus influenzae (nontypeable strains)
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa (chronic suppurative otitis media, immunocompromised)
- Fusobacterium necrophorum (anaerobe, associated with complicated mastoiditis and Lemierre syndrome)
- Polymicrobial in 10-15% of cases

**Presentation:**
- Postauricular erythema, swelling, tenderness, and fluctuance overlying the mastoid process
- Protrusion of the auricle (pinna pushed forward and outward) -- classic sign
- Fever (often > 38.5 degrees C, may be high-grade)
- Otalgia and otorrhea (often with history of preceding AOM, treated or untreated)
- Conductive hearing loss
- In young children: irritability, poor feeding, ear pulling with fever

**Stages of Disease:**
1. **Acute mastoiditis with periostitis:** Mastoid tenderness, erythema, and edema without bony destruction. May resolve with IV antibiotics alone.
2. **Coalescent mastoiditis:** Destruction of bony trabeculae. Subperiosteal abscess formation. Requires surgical drainage.
3. **Complicated mastoiditis:** Extracranial or intracranial extension. Surgical emergency.

**Complications (by anatomic extension):**

*Extracranial:*
- Subperiosteal abscess (most common complication, 15-35% of cases)
- Bezold abscess (erosion through mastoid tip medial to SCM attachment, abscess tracks along SCM into deep neck space)
- Facial nerve palsy (CN VII runs through the fallopian canal in the mastoid)
- Labyrinthitis (hearing loss, vertigo)

*Intracranial:*
- Epidural abscess (most common intracranial complication)
- Sigmoid (lateral) sinus thrombosis (5-10% mortality; spiking fevers, headache, papilledema)
- Subdural empyema
- Brain abscess (temporal lobe or cerebellum)
- Meningitis
- Gradenigo syndrome: triad of otorrhea + retro-orbital pain + CN VI (abducens) palsy, caused by petrous apicitis (infection extending to the petrous apex of the temporal bone)

**Masked (Occult) Mastoiditis:**
- Occurs when AOM is partially treated with oral antibiotics, suppressing acute symptoms but failing to eradicate mastoid infection
- Low-grade granular osteitis develops insidiously in the mastoid
- Presentation is subtle: persistent low-grade fever, mild otalgia, malaise without classic postauricular signs
- First presentation may be an intracranial complication (sinus thrombosis, abscess)
- Maintain high suspicion in a child with persistent symptoms 2-3 weeks after "treated" AOM

## Critical Actions

1. **Recognize the pattern.** Postauricular erythema, swelling, or tenderness with pinna protrusion in a child with recent or concurrent AOM is acute mastoiditis until proven otherwise. Do not dismiss this as "swollen lymph node" or "bug bite."
2. **CT temporal bone with IV contrast.** This is the diagnostic study of choice. Obtain urgently. Demonstrates mastoid opacification, coalescence (bony septal destruction), subperiosteal abscess, and intracranial complications. Include brain windows to evaluate for epidural abscess, subdural empyema, brain abscess, and sigmoid sinus thrombosis.
3. **IV antibiotics immediately.** Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV (max 2 g) as first-line. Add vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV if MRSA is suspected, if the patient is critically ill, or if there is concern for intracranial extension. Do not delay antibiotics for CT or consultation.
4. **ENT consultation.** All patients with acute mastoiditis require ENT evaluation. Myringotomy with or without tympanostomy tube placement is both diagnostic (culture) and therapeutic (drainage). Cortical mastoidectomy is indicated for subperiosteal abscess, coalescent mastoiditis, or failure to improve on IV antibiotics within 48 hours.
5. **Neurosurgical consultation** if intracranial complication identified on imaging (epidural abscess, subdural empyema, brain abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis).
6. **Admit all patients.** There is no outpatient management pathway for acute mastoiditis. All patients require IV antibiotics, serial monitoring, and ENT involvement.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Postauricular lymphadenitis | Discrete, mobile lymph node posterior to ear. No pinna protrusion, no mastoid tenderness. Normal tympanic membrane. Common in children with scalp infections or pediculosis. |
| Periauricular cellulitis / insect bite | Erythema and swelling of pinna and periauricular skin. No mastoid tenderness, no pinna protrusion. Normal otoscopy. History of bite or skin break. |
| Acute otitis externa (malignant in adults) | Ear canal tenderness and edema, tragal tenderness. Otorrhea but tympanic membrane intact. No mastoid bone tenderness or pinna protrusion. |
| Parotitis (viral or bacterial) | Swelling anterior to ear at angle of mandible. Painful parotid gland, trismus. No otic symptoms. Elevates earlobe (not protrusion). |
| Rhabdomyosarcoma of temporal bone | Progressive otalgia, bloody otorrhea, facial nerve palsy, mastoid mass. Does not respond to antibiotics. Requires CT and biopsy. Rare but important in pediatric differential. |
| Langerhans cell histiocytosis | Chronic otorrhea, mastoid lytic lesion on CT. May mimic chronic mastoiditis. Biopsy diagnostic. |
| Cholesteatoma | Chronic ear disease, pearly white mass behind TM or in attic region. Foul-smelling otorrhea. Conductive hearing loss. Erosive on CT. Can cause secondary mastoiditis. |

## Workup

**Imaging:**
- **CT temporal bone with IV contrast** -- diagnostic study of choice. Findings: mastoid air cell opacification, loss of bony septa (coalescence), cortical erosion, subperiosteal abscess (rim-enhancing fluid collection), intracranial complications. Sensitivity >95% for coalescent mastoiditis.
- **CT with venography (CTV)** -- add if sigmoid sinus thrombosis is suspected (high spiking fevers, headache, papilledema, or CT showing adjacent abscess).
- **MRI brain with contrast and MRV** -- superior to CT for evaluating intracranial complications (epidural abscess, subdural empyema, brain abscess, meningeal enhancement). Obtain if CT suggests intracranial extension or if neurologic symptoms are present.
- **Plain radiography** -- insufficient. Do not use plain films to evaluate for mastoiditis.

**Labs:**
- CBC with differential -- leukocytosis with left shift. WBC >15,000/microL and elevated absolute neutrophil count are common.
- CRP -- typically markedly elevated (>5 mg/dL in most cases). Useful for monitoring treatment response.
- Blood cultures -- obtain before antibiotics. Positive in 5-10% of cases. Higher yield in intracranial complications.
- Procalcitonin -- may help distinguish bacterial from viral illness if diagnosis uncertain.
- BMP -- baseline renal function for vancomycin dosing.

**Microbiology:**
- Tympanocentesis or myringotomy culture -- the gold standard for identifying the causative organism. ENT performs at the time of surgical intervention.
- Wound culture if subperiosteal abscess drained.
- Culture results guide targeted antibiotic therapy but should not delay empiric treatment.

**Otoscopy:**
- Bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane (AOM) or perforated TM with purulent otorrhea
- May see sagging of the posterosuperior ear canal wall (bulging due to mastoid abscess eroding into the canal)

## Treatment

**Empiric IV Antibiotics (start immediately -- do not delay for imaging or consultation):**

| Agent | Dose (Pediatric) | Dose (Adult) | Coverage |
|-------|------------------|--------------|----------|
| Ceftriaxone | 50 mg/kg IV q24h (max 2 g) | 2 g IV q24h | S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, most gram-negatives |
| Vancomycin (add if MRSA suspected, critically ill, or intracranial complication) | 15 mg/kg IV q6h | 15-20 mg/kg IV q8-12h (target AUC/MIC 400-600) | MRSA, resistant pneumococcus |
| Metronidazole (add if intracranial abscess or chronic disease with anaerobic concern) | 10 mg/kg IV q8h (max 500 mg) | 500 mg IV q8h | Anaerobes (Fusobacterium, Bacteroides) |

**Indications for adding vancomycin:**
- MRSA risk factors (prior MRSA, healthcare exposure, recent antibiotics, local MRSA prevalence >10%)
- Critically ill or septic appearance
- Intracranial complication identified
- Failure to improve on ceftriaxone after 48 hours

**Neonates (< 28 days):** Do NOT use ceftriaxone (bilirubin displacement, calcium-ceftriaxone precipitate risk). Use cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV q8h + vancomycin 15 mg/kg IV q8-12h.

**Duration:** Minimum 2-3 weeks IV antibiotics for uncomplicated mastoiditis; 4-6 weeks for intracranial complications. Transition to targeted PO antibiotics guided by culture and sensitivity when clinically improving.

**Surgical Management:**

| Procedure | Indication |
|-----------|-----------|
| Myringotomy +/- tympanostomy tube | All cases of acute mastoiditis. Provides drainage and culture. Can be therapeutic in early/uncomplicated cases (94% success rate per systematic review). |
| Incision and drainage | Subperiosteal abscess. Performed with concurrent myringotomy. |
| Cortical (simple) mastoidectomy | Coalescent mastoiditis, intracranial complication, subperiosteal abscess not responding to I&D, or failure to improve with IV antibiotics + myringotomy within 48 hours. Success rate approaches 100%. |
| Radical mastoidectomy | Chronic mastoiditis with cholesteatoma. Rarely needed in acute setting. |

**Supportive Care:**
- Analgesia: ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO q6h and/or acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO/PR q4h
- Antipyretics as above
- IV fluid maintenance if poor oral intake
- Ototopical antibiotics (ofloxacin 0.3% otic drops) if tympanic membrane is perforated or post-myringotomy

**Intracranial Complication-Specific Treatment:**
- **Sigmoid sinus thrombosis:** Anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin or LMWH is increasingly used (consult hematology and neurosurgery). Evidence from case series supports reduced morbidity. Combine with mastoidectomy and IV antibiotics.
- **Epidural abscess / subdural empyema / brain abscess:** Neurosurgical drainage + mastoidectomy + prolonged IV antibiotics (4-6 weeks minimum). Ensure anaerobic coverage with metronidazole.
- **Gradenigo syndrome (petrous apicitis):** Prolonged IV antibiotics (6 weeks). Surgical drainage if medical therapy fails.

## Disposition

**All patients with acute mastoiditis require hospital admission. There is no safe outpatient management pathway.**

**Admit to General Pediatrics / Medicine (with ENT consultation):**
- Uncomplicated mastoiditis with periostitis only (no coalescence, no abscess on CT)
- Clinically stable, non-toxic appearance
- Responding to IV antibiotics within 24-48 hours

**Admit to PICU / ICU:**
- Intracranial complication (epidural abscess, subdural empyema, brain abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis)
- Sepsis or hemodynamic instability
- Altered mental status, seizures, focal neurologic deficits
- Facial nerve palsy
- Post-mastoidectomy with intracranial involvement

**Transfer to Tertiary Center:**
- If ENT with otologic surgery capability is not available at the presenting facility
- If intracranial complication requires neurosurgical intervention not available locally
- Do not delay IV antibiotics while arranging transfer

**Discharge Criteria (from inpatient -- NOT from ED):**
- Afebrile for 48 hours
- CRP trending down
- Tolerating oral antibiotics
- ENT follow-up arranged within 1 week
- Audiology follow-up for hearing assessment after resolution
- Caregiver understands signs of recurrence and intracranial complications (worsening headache, vomiting, altered behavior, visual changes, neck stiffness)

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing postauricular swelling as lymphadenopathy.** The most common misdiagnosis in acute mastoiditis is postauricular lymphadenitis. A swollen lymph node is discrete, mobile, and does not cause pinna protrusion. Mastoiditis causes diffuse postauricular edema, erythema, tenderness over the mastoid bone itself, and anterior-lateral displacement of the pinna. If the pinna is pushed forward, it is mastoiditis until proven otherwise.

2. **Not obtaining CT with contrast.** Plain films and clinical examination alone cannot distinguish simple periostitis from coalescent mastoiditis or identify intracranial complications. CT temporal bone with IV contrast is mandatory in all suspected cases. Findings on CT directly determine whether the patient needs myringotomy alone versus mastoidectomy versus neurosurgical intervention. Skipping CT risks missing a subperiosteal abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, or epidural abscess.

3. **Failing to recognize masked mastoiditis.** A child with persistent low-grade fever, mild otalgia, or behavioral changes 2-3 weeks after "treated" AOM may have masked mastoiditis -- a smoldering mastoid infection suppressed but not eradicated by oral antibiotics. Classic postauricular signs may be absent. The first presentation may be an intracranial complication. Maintain high suspicion and obtain CT temporal bone with contrast when symptoms persist beyond the expected course of treated AOM.

4. **Delaying IV antibiotics.** Acute mastoiditis can progress to intracranial complications within hours. Start ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV (max 2 g) immediately upon clinical suspicion. Do not wait for CT results, ENT consultation, or culture data. The antibiotic dose is the same whether the patient has simple periostitis or coalescent disease -- start it first, refine the plan after imaging.

5. **Omitting ENT consultation.** Every patient with acute mastoiditis needs ENT evaluation for myringotomy. Myringotomy provides culture data (guiding targeted therapy), decompresses the middle ear, and is therapeutic in uncomplicated cases. Failure to involve ENT early delays definitive source control and culture-directed therapy. If ENT is not available, arrange transfer to a facility with otologic surgical capability.

6. **Missing intracranial complications.** Intracranial complications occur in 5-15% of acute mastoiditis cases. High spiking fevers that do not respond to antibiotics, severe headache, altered mental status, neck stiffness, papilledema, seizures, or new neurologic deficits (especially CN VI palsy) should trigger urgent re-imaging with CT venography and/or MRI. Sigmoid sinus thrombosis can present with only persistent fever and headache. Gradenigo syndrome (otorrhea + retro-orbital pain + CN VI palsy) indicates petrous apicitis and carries risk of cavernous sinus involvement.

7. **Using ceftriaxone in neonates.** Ceftriaxone displaces bilirubin from albumin (kernicterus risk) and forms calcium-ceftriaxone precipitates in neonates receiving calcium-containing IV fluids. Use cefotaxime 50 mg/kg IV q8h for neonatal mastoiditis.

8. **Attempting outpatient management.** Acute mastoiditis cannot be safely managed with oral antibiotics and outpatient follow-up. Even cases that appear clinically mild (periostitis without coalescence) require IV antibiotics, serial monitoring for progression, and ENT evaluation. The complication rate for inadequately treated mastoiditis is substantial, and progression to intracranial disease can be rapid.

9. **Forgetting to assess hearing.** Acute mastoiditis with middle ear effusion causes conductive hearing loss. In children < 2 years -- the peak age for mastoiditis -- unrecognized hearing loss during a critical language development period has long-term consequences. Ensure audiology follow-up is arranged after the acute episode resolves.
