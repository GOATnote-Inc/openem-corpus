# Placental Abruption

## Recognition

### Definition
Premature separation of a normally implanted placenta from the uterine wall after 20 weeks' gestation and before delivery. Occurs in 0.5-1% of pregnancies.

### Classic Presentation
- Painful vaginal bleeding (70-80% of cases)
- Abdominal pain — constant, not colicky
- Uterine tenderness and rigidity ("board-like" or hypertonic uterus)
- Back pain (posterior placenta)
- Uterine contractions (high-frequency, often tetanic)
- Fetal distress (non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracings)

### Classification by Severity
| Grade | Clinical Features |
|---|---|
| Grade 1 (mild) | Small retroplacental clot, no fetal distress, minimal vaginal bleeding, no coagulopathy |
| Grade 2 (moderate) | Moderate vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness and tetany, fetal distress, no maternal shock |
| Grade 3 (severe) | Severe hemorrhage (may be concealed), tetanic uterus, fetal death, maternal DIC and shock |

### Concealed Hemorrhage (20-30% of Abruptions)
- Blood trapped behind the placenta — NO external vaginal bleeding
- Severe pain and uterine rigidity with hemodynamic instability but minimal visible bleeding
- Fundal height increasing (expanding retroplacental hematoma)
- Diagnosed by clinical suspicion, not by amount of vaginal bleeding

### Risk Factors
- Prior abruption (recurrence 10-25%)
- Hypertensive disorders (preeclampsia, chronic hypertension — strongest association)
- Trauma (motor vehicle collision, domestic violence, falls)
- Cocaine/methamphetamine use (acute vasospasm)
- Smoking
- Premature rupture of membranes
- Advanced maternal age, multiparity
- Thrombophilia
- Short umbilical cord, uterine anomalies

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Two large-bore IVs (16-18G) | Immediately |
| Type and crossmatch (minimum 4 units) | Immediately |
| Continuous fetal monitoring | Immediately |
| OB consultation | Immediately — emergent cesarean for fetal distress |
| Activate massive transfusion protocol | If hemorrhagic shock |
| DIC panel | Within 30 minutes |

1. Establish two large-bore (16-18G) peripheral IVs and begin crystalloid resuscitation
2. Type and crossmatch minimum 4 units pRBCs; activate massive transfusion protocol for hemorrhagic shock
3. Place continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) immediately
4. Call OB emergently — delivery is the definitive treatment
5. Send CBC, BMP, coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer), type and crossmatch
6. Place Foley catheter — urine output is a resuscitation marker
7. Administer RhoGAM 300 mcg IM if Rh-negative
8. Left lateral decubitus positioning to optimize uterine blood flow

## Differential Diagnosis

- Placenta previa (painless vaginal bleeding, low-lying placenta on ultrasound, soft non-tender uterus)
- Uterine rupture (prior uterine scar, sudden pain, loss of fetal station, abnormal fetal heart rate, cessation of contractions)
- Vasa previa (painless bleeding at membrane rupture, fetal bradycardia, sinusoidal pattern)
- Bloody show/cervical dilation (mucous-bloody discharge, onset of labor)
- Cervical pathology (polyp, ectropion, malignancy — diagnosed on speculum exam)
- Preterm labor (regular contractions, cervical change, no hemorrhage)
- DIC from other causes (amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, HELLP syndrome)
- Ruptured ectopic pregnancy (first-trimester bleeding, adnexal mass, positive pregnancy test)

## Workup

- **Continuous electronic fetal monitoring:** Non-reassuring patterns — late decelerations, decreased variability, bradycardia, sinusoidal pattern. Most important real-time assessment of fetal status.
- **Tocodynamometry:** Frequent contractions, uterine tachysystole, elevated baseline uterine tone
- **CBC:** Hemoglobin/hematocrit (may be initially normal; trend serially), platelet count (thrombocytopenia in DIC)
- **Coagulation panel:** PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen (critical — fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL indicates significant coagulopathy; < 100 mg/dL predicts massive hemorrhage). D-dimer is elevated but nonspecific in pregnancy.
- **BMP:** Electrolytes, renal function (AKI from hypovolemia)
- **Type and crossmatch:** Minimum 4 units; Rh type for RhoGAM decision
- **Kleihauer-Betke test:** Quantifies fetal-maternal hemorrhage; guides additional RhoGAM dosing
- **Ultrasound:** Sensitivity only 25-50% for abruption (retroplacental clot may be isoechoic with placenta). Normal ultrasound does NOT exclude abruption. Useful for: placental location (exclude previa), fetal viability, gestational age, amniotic fluid volume.
- **Do NOT perform digital cervical exam** until placenta previa is excluded by ultrasound

## Treatment

### Resuscitation
- **Crystalloid:** Lactated Ringer's for initial volume expansion
- **Massive transfusion protocol:** 1:1:1 pRBC:FFP:platelets for hemorrhagic shock
- **Fibrinogen replacement:** Cryoprecipitate 10 units (each unit raises fibrinogen ~10 mg/dL) for fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL. Target fibrinogen >= 200 mg/dL.
- **Tranexamic acid 1 g IV over 10 minutes** — administer within 3 hours of bleeding onset (WOMAN trial: reduces death from hemorrhage in postpartum hemorrhage; extrapolated to antepartum use)
- **Maintain:** Hemoglobin >= 7 g/dL, platelets >= 50,000/mcL (>= 80,000 if cesarean planned), fibrinogen >= 200 mg/dL

### Delivery
- **Fetal distress with viable fetus:** Emergent cesarean delivery — this is the definitive treatment. Decision-to-incision time < 30 minutes.
- **Fetal demise:** Vaginal delivery preferred (avoids surgical risks in a coagulopathic patient). Amniotomy and oxytocin augmentation.
- **Mild abruption, term gestation, reassuring fetal status:** Expedited delivery (induction of labor with continuous fetal monitoring); low threshold for cesarean if fetal status deteriorates
- **Mild abruption, preterm, reassuring fetal status:** Observation in L&D with continuous monitoring; antenatal corticosteroids for fetal lung maturity if <34 weeks (betamethasone 12 mg IM x 2 doses, 24 hours apart); delivery if maternal or fetal status deteriorates

### RhoGAM
- **RhoGAM 300 mcg IM** for all Rh-negative patients with abruption
- Kleihauer-Betke test determines if additional doses needed (>30 mL fetal-maternal hemorrhage requires additional dosing)

### Tocolysis
- **Generally contraindicated** in significant abruption — uterine contractions are a compensatory mechanism to reduce blood loss
- Limited role for mild abruption in previable/extremely premature gestations to allow corticosteroid administration (48-hour window). Only with maternal hemodynamic stability and reassuring fetal monitoring.

### DIC Management
- Replace factors aggressively: FFP (15-20 mL/kg), cryoprecipitate (target fibrinogen >= 200), platelets (target >= 50,000)
- Delivery is the definitive treatment for DIC caused by abruption
- DIC resolves within 24-48 hours after delivery

## Disposition

- **Operating room:** Emergent cesarean for fetal distress, hemodynamic instability, or severe abruption with viable fetus
- **Labor and delivery (continuous monitoring):** All confirmed or suspected abruptions, regardless of severity
- **ICU post-delivery:** DIC, massive hemorrhage requiring ongoing transfusion, hemodynamic instability, multi-organ dysfunction
- **Never discharge a patient with suspected abruption.** Even "mild" abruptions can progress to catastrophic hemorrhage unpredictably.
- **Observation minimum:** 24 hours of continuous fetal monitoring for mild abruptions with reassuring fetal status and stable maternal hemodynamics

## Pitfalls

1. **Excluding abruption because vaginal bleeding is minimal or absent.** 20-30% of abruptions are concealed. Severe pain, uterine rigidity, hemodynamic instability, and fetal distress with minimal visible bleeding is concealed abruption until proven otherwise.

2. **Relying on ultrasound to diagnose abruption.** Ultrasound sensitivity is only 25-50%. A retroplacental clot can be isoechoic with the placenta. Abruption is a clinical diagnosis — ultrasound is useful for excluding previa, not for confirming abruption.

3. **Performing a digital cervical exam before excluding placenta previa.** Digital exam in previa causes hemorrhage. Obtain ultrasound to confirm placental location before any cervical exam.

4. **Under-resuscitating because "she's young and compensating."** Young pregnant women maintain blood pressure until 30-40% blood volume is lost, then decompensate precipitously. Tachycardia and narrowed pulse pressure in a pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding represent significant hemorrhage. Resuscitate aggressively.

5. **Failing to check fibrinogen and coagulation studies.** DIC complicates 10-20% of severe abruptions. Fibrinogen < 200 mg/dL predicts massive hemorrhage. Fibrinogen < 100 mg/dL is associated with postpartum hemorrhage refractory to standard management. Check coagulation panel early and serially.

6. **Not considering trauma and domestic violence.** Abruption is the most common cause of fetal death from trauma. Screening for intimate partner violence is mandatory. Even minor trauma can cause abruption. All pregnant trauma patients require a minimum of 4-6 hours of fetal monitoring.

7. **Delaying cesarean delivery to "optimize" coagulopathy.** In severe abruption with fetal distress, delivery is the treatment. DIC will not resolve until the placenta is delivered. Resuscitate with blood products simultaneously, but do not delay delivery.

8. **Forgetting RhoGAM in Rh-negative patients.** Fetal-maternal hemorrhage occurs in abruption. RhoGAM 300 mcg IM prevents Rh sensitization. Kleihauer-Betke quantifies hemorrhage volume for additional dosing.

9. **Assuming fetal demise means no maternal risk.** Severe abruption with fetal demise still carries life-threatening maternal DIC and hemorrhage. These patients require aggressive resuscitation, coagulation factor replacement, and expedited delivery (vaginal preferred to avoid surgical complications in coagulopathy).
