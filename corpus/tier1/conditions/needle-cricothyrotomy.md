# Needle Cricothyrotomy

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- CICO (Can't Intubate, Can't Oxygenate) in children < 10-12 years where surgical cricothyrotomy carries higher risk of subglottic stenosis
- Bridge to definitive airway in any age when surgical expertise/equipment unavailable
- CICO in adults when surgical cricothyrotomy cannot be performed (no scalpel available, provider untrained in surgical technique)

**Contraindications (all relative in a true CICO):**
- Complete laryngotracheal disruption — needle may not access functional airway
- Subglottic or tracheal obstruction below the cricothyroid membrane — jet ventilation will not ventilate past the obstruction and causes barotrauma
- Known tracheomalacia — jet ventilation pressures may collapse airway

**Key Principle:** Needle cricothyrotomy is a TEMPORIZING measure. It provides oxygenation but inadequate ventilation (CO2 cannot be cleared efficiently). Must convert to definitive airway within 30-45 minutes.

**Age Considerations:**
- < 10-12 years: needle cricothyrotomy is the preferred emergency surgical airway (smaller CTM, immature cartilage)
- Adults: surgical cricothyrotomy preferred over needle cric (faster, more reliable ventilation); needle cric used only when surgical technique not feasible

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Needle through CTM | < 30 seconds from decision |
| Air aspiration confirming tracheal entry | Immediate |
| Jet ventilation initiated | < 60 seconds from needle insertion |
| Conversion to definitive airway | < 30-45 minutes |

1. **Declare CICO** — verbal: "Can't intubate, can't oxygenate. Performing needle cricothyrotomy."
2. **Identify cricothyroid membrane** — palpate thyroid cartilage, slide inferiorly to soft depression above cricoid
3. **Insert catheter-over-needle** through CTM at 45-degree caudal angle
4. **Aspirate air** — confirms intratracheal placement
5. **Advance catheter, remove needle** — secure catheter to skin
6. **Connect to jet ventilation** or improvised oxygen source
7. **Plan definitive airway conversion** — surgical cricothyrotomy, tracheostomy, or controlled oral intubation

## Differential Diagnosis

**Alternative Emergency Airway Approaches:**

| Technique | Advantage Over Needle Cric | Disadvantage |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Surgical cricothyrotomy | Definitive airway; allows full ventilation | Higher subglottic stenosis risk in children <12 |
| SGA (iGel, LMA) | Non-invasive; fast placement | May not work in complete obstruction |
| BVM with two-person technique | Non-invasive | Inadequate in true CICO |
| Fiberoptic intubation | Maintains spontaneous breathing | Requires equipment, time, and cooperation |
| Retrograde intubation | Wire-guided oral intubation | Slow; requires CTM access anyway |

**When to Proceed Directly to Surgical Cricothyrotomy Instead:**
- Adult patient where surgical technique is available
- Prolonged need for ventilation anticipated
- Failed needle cricothyrotomy (cannot aspirate air, cannot ventilate)

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Setup:**

| Equipment | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Catheter-over-needle | 14g (adults), 16-18g (children) angiocatheter, 5 cm length minimum |
| Syringe | 10 mL, half-filled with saline (air bubbles confirm tracheal entry) |
| Jet ventilator | High-pressure wall oxygen with jet ventilation device (Manujet or similar); 15-50 psi |
| Improvised setup | 3-way stopcock + oxygen tubing + 3 mL syringe barrel (Luer-lock adapter for BVM or O2) |
| ETT adapter | 3.0 ETT adapter fits 14g catheter hub — connects to BVM |
| Tape | Secure catheter to skin |
| Suction | Yankauer for oral/pharyngeal secretions |

**Landmark Identification:**
- Thyroid cartilage notch → slide inferiorly → palpate horizontal depression between thyroid cartilage and cricoid ring = cricothyroid membrane
- Pediatric: landmarks less distinct; CTM is smaller (~3 mm height in neonates vs 9 mm in adults)
- Obese/short neck: use ultrasound if available; otherwise 4-finger technique starting at sternal notch

## Treatment

### Technique: Catheter-Over-Needle with Jet Ventilation

**Step 1: Stabilize the Larynx**
- Non-dominant hand: grasp larynx between thumb and middle finger on thyroid cartilage
- Index finger palpates and marks the CTM

**Step 2: Insert Needle**
- Attach 14g angiocatheter to 10 mL syringe containing 3-5 mL saline
- Puncture skin at midline of CTM, needle directed 45 degrees caudally (toward feet)
- Advance slowly while aspirating
- Air bubbles in saline confirm tracheal entry (loss of resistance)
- In pediatrics: use 16-18g catheter; advance more cautiously (posterior wall is closer)

**Step 3: Advance Catheter**
- Hold needle hub steady; slide plastic catheter over needle into trachea
- Remove needle entirely
- Re-aspirate through catheter to confirm intratracheal position (free air aspiration)
- Secure catheter to skin with tape or suture

**Step 4: Connect to Ventilation**

**Option A — Jet Ventilation (preferred):**
- Connect catheter hub to jet ventilation device (Manujet, Enk device)
- Settings: adults 25-50 psi (start low); pediatrics 15-25 psi
- Insufflation time: 1 second
- Exhalation time: 4 seconds (I:E ratio 1:4) — critical to allow passive exhalation through glottis
- Monitor for chest rise during insufflation and chest fall during exhalation
- Rate: 12-15 breaths/min

**Option B — Improvised BVM Ventilation:**
- Insert 3.0 ETT adapter (15 mm connector) into the catheter hub
- Attach BVM to adapter
- Ventilate with small tidal volumes — high resistance through 14g catheter limits flow
- This provides oxygenation but minimal CO2 clearance

**Option C — Wall Oxygen Insufflation:**
- Connect oxygen tubing directly to catheter hub via Luer adapter
- Flow rate 15 L/min
- Provides passive oxygenation only (no active ventilation)
- Buys time but CO2 will rise

### Pediatric-Specific Technique
- Catheter size: 16g (> 5 years), 18g (1-5 years), 18-20g (< 1 year)
- Jet ventilation pressure: start at 5 psi (infants), 10-15 psi (children), 15-25 psi (adolescents)
- Shorter exhalation time acceptable: I:E 1:3
- Conversion to definitive airway is more urgent in children (smaller catheter = less gas exchange)

### Post-Procedure
- Monitor SpO2 continuously
- Watch for subcutaneous emphysema (indicates catheter displacement or barotrauma)
- Auscultate for bilateral air entry and watch for chest rise
- Prepare for conversion to definitive airway: surgical cricothyrotomy (adult), tracheostomy, or controlled oral intubation when conditions allow
- Maximum safe duration: 30-45 minutes (progressive hypercarbia is inevitable)

## Disposition

- **Successful needle cricothyrotomy with adequate oxygenation:** convert to definitive airway (surgical cric, tracheostomy, or oral intubation) within 30-45 minutes; ICU admission
- **Failed needle cricothyrotomy (no air aspiration, cannot ventilate):** immediately attempt surgical cricothyrotomy (adults) or re-attempt needle cric with landmark reassessment (children)
- **Barotrauma (subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax):** needle decompression of tension pneumothorax if present; continue ventilation efforts; surgical airway conversion
- **Transfer:** stabilize with needle cric in situ and transfer only if definitive airway cannot be established; en-route airway management required

## Pitfalls

1. **Treating needle cricothyrotomy as a definitive airway.** It is a bridge only. CO2 clearance through a 14g catheter is minimal. Hypercarbia develops within 30-45 minutes. Plan for conversion to definitive airway from the moment the needle is placed.

2. **Using jet ventilation without an open upper airway for exhalation.** In complete upper airway obstruction, exhaled gas cannot escape through the glottis. Jet insufflation against a closed system causes tension pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema within minutes. Upper airway must have some patency for passive exhalation, OR a second large-bore catheter must be placed for egress.

3. **Insufflating at excessive pressure in pediatric patients.** Pediatric airways require lower pressures (5-25 psi vs 25-50 psi in adults). Over-pressurization causes barotrauma rapidly in smaller airways. Start at the lowest pressure that produces visible chest rise.

4. **Posterior tracheal wall puncture.** The posterior membranous trachea is thin and directly anterior to the esophagus. Advance the needle slowly while aspirating. Stop advancing the moment air is aspirated. In children, the anteroposterior tracheal diameter is smaller, making posterior wall puncture more likely.

5. **Catheter kinking or dislodgement during ventilation.** The 14g angiocatheter is flexible and kinks easily, especially with patient movement or neck flexion. Secure with tape and suture. If ventilation suddenly fails, suspect catheter kink or displacement before equipment failure. Re-aspirate to confirm intratracheal position.

6. **Failing to use saline-filled syringe for tracheal entry confirmation.** Dry aspiration can be ambiguous — is the air from the trachea or subcutaneous tissue? Saline in the syringe produces visible bubbling when tracheal air is aspirated, providing unambiguous confirmation.

7. **Delaying the procedure due to unfamiliarity.** Needle cricothyrotomy is performed rarely, and providers lack comfort. In pediatric CICO, this is the recommended surgical airway. Simulation training and premarking the CTM before initial intubation attempt reduce cognitive delay.
