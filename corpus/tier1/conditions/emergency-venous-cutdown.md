# Emergency Venous Cutdown

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Failed percutaneous venous access (peripheral, central, IO) in a patient requiring urgent vascular access
- Hypovolemic shock with collapsed veins precluding percutaneous access
- Pediatric patients with inaccessible peripheral veins (burns, edema, obesity) when IO not feasible
- Trauma resuscitation when all percutaneous routes have failed
- Historically more common; now largely replaced by IO access and ultrasound-guided peripheral/central venous access

**Contraindications:**
- Overlying cellulitis or soft tissue infection at the cutdown site
- Traumatic disruption of the proximal venous drainage (e.g., pelvic fracture for saphenous, upper extremity vascular injury for cephalic)
- Significant coagulopathy (relative — may still proceed in life-threatening situations)
- Deep venous thrombosis in the target vein (relative)

**Modern Context:** Venous cutdown is a rescue procedure. With the availability of IO access (< 60 seconds) and US-guided IV/central line placement, cutdown is rarely needed. However, it remains a critical skill when all other access routes fail.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Decision to cutdown | After all percutaneous and IO routes exhausted |
| Skin incision to vein isolation | < 3 minutes |
| Vein cannulated and flow confirmed | < 5 minutes total |

1. **Identify the cutdown site** — greater saphenous vein at the ankle (most reliable), or cephalic vein at the wrist, or saphenous vein at the groin
2. **Prep and anesthetize** (if conscious)
3. **Make transverse skin incision** over the vein
4. **Bluntly dissect to isolate the vein**
5. **Cannulate the vein** — direct cannulation or venotomy with catheter threading
6. **Confirm flow** — aspiration of blood, free-flowing IV fluid
7. **Secure catheter and close incision**

## Differential Diagnosis

**Alternative Vascular Access:**

| Alternative | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Intraosseous access | Faster (< 60 sec), less invasive; should be attempted before cutdown |
| Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV | Non-invasive; may succeed when blind PIV fails |
| Central venous catheter | US-guided IJ or femoral may succeed when peripheral fails |
| Umbilical vein catheter | Neonates (first 1-2 weeks of life) |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Setup:**

| Equipment | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Scalpel | No. 15 blade |
| Hemostats | 2 curved mosquito clamps |
| Tissue forceps | Fine-tipped |
| Scissors | Iris scissors, curved |
| Silk ties | 3-0 or 4-0 silk x 2 (proximal and distal ligatures) |
| Catheter | 16-18g angiocatheter or pediatric feeding tube (3-5 Fr) |
| IV tubing | With fluid ready to infuse |
| Suture | 4-0 nylon for skin closure |
| Lidocaine | 1% lidocaine 3-5 mL (if patient is conscious) |
| Antiseptic | Chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine |
| Gauze | 4x4 pads |

**Anatomic Landmarks:**

| Site | Location | Vein | Advantage |
|------|----------|------|-----------|
| Ankle (primary) | 1-2 cm anterior and 1 cm superior to the medial malleolus | Greater saphenous vein | Most consistent anatomy; superficial; large caliber (3-4 mm) |
| Groin | 3-4 cm inferior and 3-4 cm lateral to pubic tubercle | Saphenous vein at saphenofemoral junction | Large caliber; good for rapid infusion |
| Wrist | Radial side of volar wrist, over the anatomical snuffbox | Cephalic vein | Accessible; away from major arteries |

## Treatment

### Greater Saphenous Vein Cutdown at the Ankle (Standard Technique)

**Step 1: Position and Prep**
- Patient supine; externally rotate the leg slightly
- Identify the medial malleolus
- Mark insertion site: 1-2 cm anterior and 1 cm superior to the medial malleolus
- Chlorhexidine skin prep
- Lidocaine 1% 3-5 mL locally (if conscious)

**Step 2: Skin Incision**
- Transverse incision 2-3 cm in length at the marked site
- Cut through skin and subcutaneous tissue
- The greater saphenous vein lies in the subcutaneous fat, directly on the periosteum of the tibia

**Step 3: Vein Isolation**
- Use curved hemostat to bluntly dissect the tissue — spread parallel to the vein
- Identify the vein: blue-tinged, thin-walled, collapses with pressure (distinguish from nerve — white, round, non-collapsible)
- Pass curved hemostat beneath the vein to isolate it
- Place two 3-0 silk ties beneath the vein (proximal and distal)

**Step 4: Vein Control**
- Tie the distal ligature (toward the foot) and leave long ends for traction
- Apply gentle traction on the distal tie to elevate and stabilize the vein
- Leave the proximal ligature untied but in place

**Step 5: Venotomy and Cannulation**

**Method A — Direct Cannulation (faster):**
- Under direct vision, puncture the exposed vein with a 16-18g angiocatheter directed proximally (toward the heart)
- Advance the catheter into the vein lumen
- Confirm venous blood return

**Method B — Formal Venotomy:**
- Using iris scissors, make a small transverse venotomy (cut halfway through the vein) on the anterior surface
- Insert the catheter tip (or feeding tube) into the venotomy directed proximally
- Advance 10-15 cm
- Confirm blood return

**Step 6: Secure**
- Tie the proximal ligature around the vein and catheter together (secures catheter in place)
- Connect IV tubing, confirm free flow of fluid
- Close skin with 4-0 nylon interrupted sutures
- Apply sterile dressing

### Post-Procedure
- Confirm fluid infusion flowing freely
- Monitor distal extremity for perfusion
- Plan to convert to percutaneous access within 24-48 hours (cutdown sites have higher infection and phlebitis rates)
- Document: site, vein, catheter size, complications

## Disposition

- **Successful cutdown with IV flow:** continue resuscitation; convert to percutaneous access within 24-48 hours
- **Failed cutdown (vein not found or too small):** attempt contralateral saphenous or groin cutdown; consider alternative routes
- **Wound infection/phlebitis (delayed):** remove catheter, antibiotics, wound care
- **Transfer:** cutdown site is stable for transport; ensure catheter is secured and flowing

## Pitfalls

1. **Performing venous cutdown before attempting IO access.** IO placement takes < 60 seconds with a powered device and has > 90% first-attempt success. Venous cutdown takes 5-10 minutes. In resuscitation, IO is faster and should be attempted before committing to a surgical approach.

2. **Transecting the saphenous nerve instead of the vein.** The saphenous nerve runs alongside the greater saphenous vein at the ankle. The nerve appears white, round, and does not collapse when compressed. The vein is blue-tinged and collapses. Identify both structures before cutting.

3. **Making the skin incision too small.** A 2-3 cm incision is needed to adequately visualize and isolate the vein. A small incision creates a narrow working space, leading to blind dissection, vein injury, and prolonged procedure time.

4. **Cutting completely through the vein during venotomy.** The venotomy should transect only the anterior half of the vein wall, creating a flap through which the catheter is inserted. Cutting all the way through the vein severs it, causing hemorrhage and loss of the access site. Use iris scissors with a controlled, partial cut.

5. **Not tying the distal ligature for traction.** The distal silk tie elevates and stabilizes the vein, making venotomy and cannulation significantly easier. Without it, the vein collapses and retracts, making cannulation difficult.

6. **Leaving the cutdown catheter in place long-term.** Cutdown sites have higher infection and phlebitis rates than percutaneous sites (15-20% phlebitis at 48 hours). Convert to standard percutaneous access as soon as the patient is stabilized, ideally within 24 hours.
