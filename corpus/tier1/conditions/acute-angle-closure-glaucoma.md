# Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma

## Recognition

**Definition:** Sudden obstruction of aqueous humor outflow at the trabecular meshwork due to apposition of the peripheral iris to the cornea, causing acute elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP). Constitutes an ophthalmologic emergency — permanent optic nerve and retinal damage occur within hours.

### Classic Presentation
- Unilateral (rarely bilateral) severe eye pain
- Headache — often severe, ipsilateral; frequently misdiagnosed as migraine or cluster headache
- Nausea and vomiting (vagal response to elevated IOP — triggers misdiagnosis as GI or neurologic condition)
- Halos around lights (corneal edema refracting light)
- Blurred or decreased vision in the affected eye
- Mid-dilated, fixed (non-reactive) pupil
- Hazy, steamy, edematous cornea
- Conjunctival injection (ciliary flush)
- Rock-hard globe on digital palpation (compared to the soft fellow eye)
- IOP >40 mmHg (normal 10-21 mmHg); often 50-80 mmHg

### Risk Factors
- Age >50 years
- Female sex (2-4x higher risk)
- Hyperopia (farsightedness — anatomically shorter globe, shallower anterior chamber)
- Asian descent (shallower anterior chambers)
- Inuit descent
- Family history of angle closure
- Medications: anticholinergics, sympathomimetics, topiramate, sulfonamides, SSRIs

### Drug-Induced Causes (Recognize in ED)
- Anticholinergics (atropine, scopolamine, ipratropium, antihistamines, TCAs)
- Sympathomimetics (phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, nasal decongestants)
- Topiramate (ciliary body edema — unique mechanism, bilateral)
- Sulfonamides (ciliary body edema)
- SSRIs (mild mydriasis)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Measure IOP (tonometry) | Immediately — confirms diagnosis |
| Initiate topical IOP-lowering agents | Within minutes of diagnosis |
| Systemic IOP reduction | Acetazolamide 500 mg IV or PO immediately |
| Emergent ophthalmology consult | For laser peripheral iridotomy (definitive treatment) |
| Treat the fellow eye | Prophylactic pilocarpine — fellow eye at high risk |
| Do NOT dilate the affected eye | Worsens angle closure |

1. Measure IOP with Tono-Pen or Goldmann applanation tonometry — IOP >21 mmHg confirms elevated pressure; IOP >40 mmHg in the acute setting with compatible exam confirms angle closure
2. Administer topical agents in rapid sequence (see Treatment)
3. Administer acetazolamide 500 mg IV (preferred) or PO
4. Obtain emergent ophthalmology consultation for laser peripheral iridotomy
5. Reassess IOP at 30-60 minute intervals
6. If IOP remains >40 mmHg after initial therapy, administer IV mannitol

## Differential Diagnosis

- Migraine or cluster headache (no IOP elevation, no corneal edema, pupil may be small in cluster)
- Anterior uveitis/iritis (miotic pupil, photophobia, cells/flare on slit lamp, IOP normal or low)
- Conjunctivitis (bilateral, discharge, no IOP elevation, no corneal edema)
- Corneal abrasion or ulcer (fluorescein uptake, foreign body sensation, no IOP elevation)
- Retrobulbar hemorrhage (proptosis, post-trauma or post-procedure, restricted extraocular movements)
- Intracranial hypertension (bilateral papilledema, visual field loss, headache)
- Cavernous sinus thrombosis (proptosis, cranial nerve palsies, chemosis)
- Orbital cellulitis (proptosis, eyelid edema, fever, restricted EOM)
- Neovascular glaucoma (rubeosis iridis, proliferative retinopathy in diabetics)

## Workup

- **Tonometry (Tono-Pen or Goldmann):** IOP measurement is diagnostic. IOP >40 mmHg with mid-dilated pupil and hazy cornea confirms angle-closure crisis. Compare with fellow eye.
- **Slit-lamp examination:** Corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, mid-dilated non-reactive pupil, conjunctival injection, cells/flare in anterior chamber. Gonioscopy (by ophthalmology) confirms closed angle.
- **Visual acuity:** Document baseline — typically markedly decreased in the affected eye
- **Pupillary exam:** Mid-dilated (4-6 mm), fixed, non-reactive to light. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) if optic nerve damage has occurred.
- **Fundoscopy:** Optic disc edema, cupping. May be difficult to visualize through hazy cornea.

**Laboratory studies are NOT required for diagnosis.** Obtain BMP if administering IV mannitol (monitor renal function and electrolytes) or acetazolamide (metabolic acidosis risk).

**Do NOT obtain:** CT head unless concomitant neurologic concern. Acute angle closure is a clinical and tonometric diagnosis.

## Treatment

### Topical Agents (Apply in Rapid Sequence)
1. **Timolol 0.5% — 1 drop to affected eye** (beta-blocker — decreases aqueous production). Avoid in asthma, severe COPD, bradycardia, heart block.
2. **Apraclonidine 1% — 1 drop to affected eye** (alpha-2 agonist — decreases aqueous production)
3. **Pilocarpine 2% — 1 drop to affected eye, repeat in 15 minutes x 1** (miotic — constricts pupil, pulls iris away from trabecular meshwork). Pilocarpine is INEFFECTIVE at IOP >40 mmHg because the iris sphincter is paralyzed by ischemia at very high pressures — administer after initial IOP reduction with other agents.
4. **Prednisolone acetate 1% — 1 drop to affected eye q15min x 4** (reduces intraocular inflammation from the acute attack)

### Systemic Agents
- **Acetazolamide 500 mg IV (preferred) or PO** — carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, decreases aqueous production. Contraindicated in sulfa anaphylaxis, sickle cell disease (causes sickling), severe renal or hepatic disease.
- **If IOP remains >40 mmHg after 30-60 minutes of topical + acetazolamide:**
  - **Mannitol 1-2 g/kg IV over 45 minutes** (osmotic diuretic — dehydrates vitreous body, rapidly lowers IOP). Contraindicated in heart failure and renal failure. Monitor electrolytes and volume status.

### Fellow Eye Prophylaxis
- **Pilocarpine 2% — 1 drop to the fellow eye** — the fellow eye has the same anatomic predisposition and is at high risk for acute angle closure. Treat prophylactically.

### Definitive Treatment
- **Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI):** Creates a hole in the peripheral iris, bypassing the pupillary block. Performed by ophthalmology. This is the definitive treatment — medical therapy is temporizing.
- **Surgical iridectomy:** If LPI is technically impossible (severe corneal edema precluding laser)
- **Lens extraction:** In phacomorphic angle closure (lens-induced), cataract extraction resolves the underlying mechanism

### Antiemetics
- **Ondansetron 4 mg IV** — treat nausea/vomiting; avoid promethazine and other anticholinergic antiemetics (worsen mydriasis)

## Disposition

- **Ophthalmology consultation required for all patients.** Laser peripheral iridotomy is typically performed within hours of presentation (urgently, same day).
- **Admission:** IOP refractory to medical therapy, significant comorbidities precluding safe discharge, inability to adhere to topical medication regimen
- **Discharge with urgent ophthalmology follow-up (within 24 hours):** If IOP is adequately reduced (<30 mmHg), visual acuity is stable, pain is controlled, and ophthalmology approves outpatient LPI
- **Follow-up for fellow eye:** LPI to fellow eye is performed electively (typically within days) — prophylactic iridotomy prevents future acute attacks

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosing as migraine or cluster headache.** Severe unilateral headache with nausea and vomiting is the dominant presentation pattern. If a "headache" patient has a red eye, decreased vision, or an abnormal pupil, measure IOP. A missed angle-closure attack causes permanent blindness.

2. **Misdiagnosing as a GI condition due to prominent nausea and vomiting.** Vagal response to elevated IOP causes significant nausea and vomiting. Patients may report GI complaints more prominently than eye pain. Always examine the eyes in patients with unexplained vomiting and headache.

3. **Dilating the affected eye.** Mydriatics (tropicamide, phenylephrine, cyclopentolate, atropine) worsen angle closure by increasing pupillary block. Never dilate a painful eye with a mid-dilated fixed pupil and elevated IOP.

4. **Administering anticholinergic antiemetics.** Promethazine, diphenhydramine, and scopolamine have anticholinergic properties that cause mydriasis and worsen angle closure. Use ondansetron for nausea/vomiting.

5. **Giving pilocarpine before reducing IOP below 40 mmHg.** At very high IOP, the iris sphincter muscle is ischemic and paralyzed — pilocarpine will not constrict the pupil. Reduce IOP first with timolol, apraclonidine, and acetazolamide, then administer pilocarpine once IOP has decreased enough for the sphincter to respond.

6. **Failing to treat the fellow eye.** The contralateral eye has the same shallow anterior chamber anatomy and is at high risk for an acute attack. Apply pilocarpine 2% to the fellow eye and ensure ophthalmology schedules prophylactic laser peripheral iridotomy.

7. **Discharging without ophthalmology involvement.** Medical therapy is temporizing. Definitive treatment is laser peripheral iridotomy. Discharging without ophthalmology consultation or confirmed urgent follow-up risks recurrent attacks and vision loss.

8. **Administering IV mannitol to patients with heart failure or renal failure.** Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that expands intravascular volume before diuresis. In heart failure, this precipitates acute pulmonary edema. In renal failure, mannitol accumulates without diuresis. Check renal function and cardiac history before administration.

9. **Not recognizing drug-induced angle closure.** Topiramate and sulfonamides cause bilateral angle closure via ciliary body edema (different mechanism than pupillary block — LPI may not help). Discontinue the offending medication immediately. Cycloplegia (not miotics) may be appropriate — ophthalmology guidance is essential.

10. **Failing to recheck IOP after treatment.** Reassess IOP at 30-60 minute intervals to confirm response to therapy. If IOP remains >40 mmHg, escalate to IV mannitol. Persistent elevation despite maximal medical therapy requires emergent surgical intervention.
