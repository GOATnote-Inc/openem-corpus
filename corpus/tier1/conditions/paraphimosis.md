# Paraphimosis

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Retracted foreskin trapped proximal to the glans, unable to be returned to normal position
- Progressive edema and pain of the glans and distal foreskin
- Constricting band of tissue visible proximal to the corona

**Common causes:**
- Foreskin not returned after catheter placement, physical exam, or hygiene
- Post-circumcision with incomplete foreskin removal
- Penile piercings
- Sexual activity
- Chronic balanoposthitis with scarring

**Key clinical features:**
- Glans appears engorged, edematous, and often cyanotic
- Constricting ring of foreskin visible behind the corona
- Pain increases over time as venous congestion worsens
- Late: ischemic changes (dusky, black glans) — indicates arterial compromise

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Attempt manual reduction | Immediately upon recognition |
| Urology consultation if reduction fails | Within 1 hour |
| Dorsal slit if manual reduction fails | < 2 hours |

1. **Apply topical anesthesia** — lidocaine 2% gel to foreskin and glans
2. **Reduce edema** — wrap glans in gauze soaked with granulated sugar (osmotic) for 15-30 minutes, or apply ice
3. **Manual reduction** — firm circumferential pressure on glans for 5-10 minutes to reduce edema, then push glans back through the constricting band while pulling foreskin distally
4. **If manual reduction fails:** dorsal penile nerve block, then attempt again
5. **If still unsuccessful:** dorsal slit procedure (emergency release of constricting band)
6. **Assess for ischemic damage** after successful reduction

## Differential Diagnosis

- Phimosis (inability to retract foreskin — opposite problem, less acute)
- Penile tourniquet syndrome (hair/ring/thread constricting penis — inspect circumferentially)
- Angioedema of the penis (bilateral swelling, no constricting band)
- Balanitis (erythema, discharge, foreskin reducible)
- Penile fracture (acute event, "popping" sound, rapid unilateral swelling)
- Priapism (erection without constricting band)
- Fournier gangrene (crepitus, systemic toxicity, rapid spread)

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis** — no imaging required in straightforward cases
- **Urinalysis** if UTI suspected as contributing factor
- If post-reduction concern for tissue damage:
  - **CBC** — baseline
  - **Penile Doppler ultrasound** — assess vascular integrity if ischemia suspected

## Treatment

### Step 1: Edema Reduction
- **Osmotic technique:** wrap glans with gauze covered in granulated sugar for 15-30 minutes; osmotic gradient reduces edema
- **Ice application:** crushed ice in glove applied to glans for 5-10 minutes
- **Elastic bandage:** gentle circumferential compression wrap from glans proximally for 5 minutes

### Step 2: Manual Reduction
- **Topical anesthesia:** lidocaine 2% gel applied 10 minutes prior
- **Dorsal penile nerve block:** 1% lidocaine without epinephrine, 3-5 mL injected at 10 and 2 o'clock positions at base of penis
- **Technique:** encircle glans with both thumbs on dorsal surface, apply steady firm pressure for 5-10 minutes while using index fingers to pull foreskin distally over the glans
- **Puncture technique** (if above fails): use 20G needle to make multiple punctures in edematous foreskin, then squeeze out edema fluid before reattempting reduction

### Step 3: Dorsal Slit (If Manual Reduction Fails)
- Dorsal penile nerve block required
- **Technique:** place straight hemostat at 12 o'clock position on constricting band for 1-2 minutes, then cut through the crushed tissue with scissors
- Hemostasis with absorbable sutures
- **Urology follow-up** for elective circumcision

### Antibiotics (Only If Infection Present)
- **Cephalexin 500 mg PO QID x 7 days** if secondary cellulitis
- **Warm soaks** BID for local hygiene

## Disposition

- **Successful reduction, no ischemia:** Discharge with urology follow-up in 1-2 weeks for elective circumcision; foreskin hygiene education
- **Post-dorsal slit:** Discharge with urology follow-up in 3-5 days; wound care instructions
- **Ischemic changes or failed reduction:** Admission for urgent urology evaluation and possible surgical intervention
- **All patients:** education on returning foreskin to anatomic position after retraction

## Pitfalls

1. **Failure to return foreskin after Foley catheter placement.** This is the most common iatrogenic cause. Every nurse and physician must verify foreskin position after catheterization in uncircumcised patients.

2. **Delayed recognition in non-verbal patients (dementia, sedated, pediatric).** Paraphimosis may go unnoticed for hours. Examine the genitalia in any patient with unexplained agitation or groin discomfort.

3. **Insufficient edema reduction before attempting manual reduction.** Forcing reduction through a tight, edematous band causes more swelling and pain. Spend 15-30 minutes on osmotic/ice techniques first.

4. **Missing penile tourniquet syndrome.** A hair or thread wrapped around the penis (especially in infants) can mimic paraphimosis. Inspect circumferentially under good lighting; use depilatory cream or cut the strand if found.

5. **Assuming glans discoloration is normal post-reduction.** After successful reduction, a dusky glans that does not reperfuse within 30 minutes suggests arterial compromise and warrants urology consultation.
