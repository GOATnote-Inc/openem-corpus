# Acute Epididymitis

## Recognition

**Classic presentation:**
- Gradual onset unilateral scrotal pain over hours to days
- Scrotal swelling, erythema, warmth
- Positive Prehn sign (pain relief with scrotal elevation — unreliable as sole differentiator)
- Tenderness localized to epididymis (posterior testis) early; diffuses to entire testis later
- Fever, dysuria, urethral discharge (variable)

**Age-based etiology:**
- Age < 35: sexually transmitted — Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae
- Age > 35: enteric organisms — E. coli, Pseudomonas (especially with BPH, instrumentation, or catheter)
- Men who have sex with men: enteric organisms from insertive anal intercourse
- Prepubertal boys: post-viral, congenital anomalies, or UTI

**Key distinction from torsion:**
- Gradual onset (vs sudden in torsion)
- Preserved cremasteric reflex (absent in torsion)
- Normal testicular lie (horizontal lie suggests torsion)
- Pyuria on UA supports epididymitis

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Exclude testicular torsion | < 30 minutes from triage |
| Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler if any doubt | < 2 hours |
| Empiric antibiotics | Within 1 hour of diagnosis |

1. **Rule out testicular torsion** — especially in patients < 25 years; if any doubt, get Doppler ultrasound or urology consult immediately
2. **Urinalysis and urine culture**
3. **STI testing** — NAAT for gonorrhea/chlamydia (urethral swab or first-void urine)
4. **Empiric antibiotics** — based on likely pathogen (STI vs enteric)
5. **Pain control** — scrotal support, ice, NSAIDs

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Testicular torsion** (sudden onset, absent cremasteric reflex, abnormal testicular lie — surgical emergency)
- Torsion of appendix testis/epididymis (blue dot sign, focal tenderness at upper pole)
- Orchitis (isolated; mumps-associated in unvaccinated)
- Testicular tumor (painless mass, firm, non-transilluminating)
- Inguinal hernia (reducible mass, bowel sounds in scrotum)
- Scrotal abscess or Fournier gangrene (crepitus, systemic toxicity)
- Hydrocele (painless, transilluminates)
- Varicocele (bag-of-worms consistency, worse with standing)

## Workup

- **Scrotal ultrasound with Doppler:** increased epididymal blood flow (hyperemia), enlarged epididymis, reactive hydrocele. Preserved or increased testicular flow (vs absent in torsion)
- **Urinalysis:** pyuria supports infectious etiology
- **Urine culture:** identifies enteric organisms
- **Urethral NAAT:** Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing in sexually active patients < 35
- **CBC:** leukocytosis (variable)
- **Blood cultures:** only if systemically toxic (fever, tachycardia, rigors)

## Treatment

### Sexually Transmitted (age < 35, STI risk factors)
- **Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM x 1** (1 g IM if body weight >= 150 kg)
- PLUS **doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 10 days**
- If chlamydia-only suspected and gonorrhea ruled out: doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 10 days alone

### Enteric Organisms (age > 35, BPH, instrumentation, MSM with insertive anal sex)
- **Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM x 1**
- PLUS **levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily x 10 days**
- Alternative: TMP-SMX 160/800 mg PO BID x 10-14 days (if culture-guided)

### Supportive Care
- **Ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6h** or **naproxen 500 mg PO BID** with food
- Scrotal elevation (athletic supporter)
- Ice packs 20 minutes on/off
- Activity restriction until symptoms improving

### Complicated Epididymitis (Abscess Formation)
- **IV antibiotics:** ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h + gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV q24h (or piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV q6h)
- Urology consultation for drainage if abscess > 3 cm
- Orchiectomy if testicular necrosis

## Disposition

- **Uncomplicated:** Discharge with oral antibiotics, urology follow-up in 5-7 days
- **STI-positive:** treat sexual partners; health department notification per local requirements
- **Abscess, sepsis, or inability to exclude torsion:** Admission, IV antibiotics, urology consultation
- **Pediatric:** urology referral for evaluation of congenital anomalies

## Pitfalls

1. **Misdiagnosing testicular torsion as epididymitis.** This is the most dangerous error in scrotal emergencies. In any patient < 25 with acute scrotal pain, torsion must be excluded with Doppler ultrasound or surgical exploration. A missed torsion leads to testicular loss.

2. **Relying on Prehn sign to differentiate torsion from epididymitis.** Prehn sign (pain relief with elevation) has poor sensitivity and specificity. It should never be used as the sole criterion to exclude torsion.

3. **Not testing for STIs in young men.** Empiric treatment without testing misses the opportunity for partner notification and treatment. Send NAAT before giving antibiotics.

4. **Failure to reassess for Fournier gangrene.** Epididymitis with rapidly spreading erythema, crepitus, or systemic toxicity may represent Fournier gangrene — a surgical emergency requiring immediate debridement.

5. **Undertreating complicated epididymitis.** Patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, or urinary tract abnormalities may develop epididymal abscess. Low threshold for imaging and admission in these populations.
