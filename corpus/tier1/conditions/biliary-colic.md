# Biliary Colic

## Recognition

**Presentation:**
- Episodic RUQ or epigastric pain, often postprandial (fatty meals)
- Pain is steady (not truly colicky despite the name), builds over 15-30 minutes
- Duration: 30 minutes to 6 hours (pain lasting > 6 hours suggests acute cholecystitis)
- Radiation to right scapula or right shoulder (referred from diaphragmatic irritation)
- Associated nausea, vomiting
- Pain resolves spontaneously or with analgesics
- Intervals between attacks: days to months

**Key distinction from acute cholecystitis:**
- Biliary colic: pain < 6 hours, no fever, no leukocytosis, negative Murphy sign, normal gallbladder wall on US
- Acute cholecystitis: pain > 6 hours, fever, leukocytosis, positive Murphy sign, gallbladder wall thickening/pericholecystic fluid

**Risk factors (4 F's mnemonic — limited; actual risk factors broader):**
- Female sex, fertile age, family history, obesity
- Rapid weight loss, TPN, pregnancy, fibrate or OCPs use
- Native American, Hispanic descent

**Exam findings:**
- Mild RUQ tenderness during acute episode
- Negative Murphy sign (deep inspiration during RUQ palpation does not arrest breathing)
- No peritoneal signs
- Afebrile, non-toxic appearing

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess for complications** — acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis (jaundice, elevated LFTs), gallstone pancreatitis (elevated lipase)
2. **RUQ ultrasound** — confirm gallstones, evaluate gallbladder wall, CBD diameter
3. **Labs:** CBC, hepatic panel, lipase — exclude cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis
4. **Pain management:**
   - Ketorolac 30 mg IV (first-line — NSAIDs are most effective for biliary colic)
   - OR diclofenac 75 mg IM
   - Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV for refractory pain
5. **Antiemetic:** ondansetron 4 mg IV
6. **NPO** during acute episode
7. **Surgical referral for elective cholecystectomy**

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Acute cholecystitis** — pain > 6 hours, fever, leukocytosis, positive Murphy sign, GB wall thickening > 3 mm on US
- **Choledocholithiasis** — jaundice, elevated bilirubin/ALP/GGT, CBD dilation > 6 mm on US
- **Gallstone pancreatitis** — epigastric pain radiating to back, lipase > 3x ULN
- **Acute cholangitis** — Charcot triad (fever, jaundice, RUQ pain); Reynolds pentad adds hypotension, AMS
- **Peptic ulcer disease** — epigastric burning pain, relationship to meals; EGD diagnostic
- **GERD/esophagitis** — retrosternal burning, relief with antacids
- **Hepatitis** — elevated transaminases, viral serologies
- **Right lower lobe pneumonia** — cough, fever, referred RUQ pain; CXR diagnostic
- **STEMI (inferior)** — ECG changes; epigastric pain mimics biliary colic
- **Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome** — perihepatitis from PID; young female with RUQ pain

## Workup

- **RUQ ultrasound (first-line imaging):**
  - Gallstones (sensitivity > 95%)
  - Gallbladder wall thickness (normal < 3 mm)
  - Pericholecystic fluid (suggests cholecystitis)
  - CBD diameter (normal ≤ 6 mm; > 8 mm suggests choledocholithiasis)
  - Sonographic Murphy sign
- **Labs:**
  - CBC: leukocytosis suggests cholecystitis
  - Hepatic panel: AST, ALT, total/direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, GGT
  - Lipase: exclude gallstone pancreatitis
  - If LFTs elevated: suspect CBD stone → MRCP or EUS
- **HIDA scan:** if ultrasound normal but clinical suspicion for acalculous cholecystitis or biliary dyskinesia (GB ejection fraction < 35%)
- **MRCP:** if CBD stone suspected (elevated LFTs, dilated CBD) and endoscopic evaluation not immediately needed
- **ECG:** if epigastric pain to exclude inferior MI

## Treatment

**Acute pain management:**
- Ketorolac 30 mg IV (15 mg if age > 65, renal impairment, or weight < 50 kg) — NSAIDs reduce gallbladder smooth muscle contraction
- Diclofenac 75 mg IM (alternative)
- Morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV q4h PRN or hydromorphone 0.5-1 mg IV q4h PRN (for NSAID-refractory pain)
- Note: opioids historically thought to increase sphincter of Oddi pressure — clinical significance is debatable; do not withhold for severe pain
- Anticholinergics (hyoscine butylbromide): weak evidence, not first-line in US practice

**Antiemetic:**
- Ondansetron 4 mg IV q6h PRN

**Definitive treatment:**
- Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (recommended for all symptomatic cholelithiasis)
- Risk of recurrent biliary colic: 50% per year, 2-3% per year progress to acute cholecystitis or complications
- Same-admission cholecystectomy may be offered for recurrent biliary colic to reduce readmission

**Non-surgical candidates:**
- Ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) 10 mg/kg/day PO in 2-3 divided doses for dissolution of small cholesterol stones (< 10 mm) — slow, limited efficacy (50% dissolution at 6 months)
- Low-fat diet counseling

## Disposition

- **Discharge (majority):**
  - Pain resolved, tolerating PO
  - Labs normal (no elevated LFTs, normal lipase)
  - US confirms cholelithiasis without cholecystitis
  - Arrange outpatient surgical consultation for elective cholecystectomy within 2-4 weeks
  - Prescriptions: ketorolac 10 mg PO q6h PRN x 5 days or ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6h PRN with food, ondansetron 4 mg PO q8h PRN, PPI if GERD symptoms
  - Low-fat diet counseling
  - Return precautions: fever, persistent pain > 6 hours, jaundice, vomiting
- **Admit:** persistent pain > 6 hours (likely cholecystitis), elevated LFTs (choledocholithiasis), elevated lipase (pancreatitis), unable to tolerate PO, unreliable follow-up

## Pitfalls

1. **Diagnosing biliary colic when pain has lasted > 6 hours.** Pain duration > 6 hours suggests progression to acute cholecystitis. Obtain repeat labs and imaging; reassess for signs of cholecystitis.

2. **Missing choledocholithiasis.** Always check LFTs. Elevated bilirubin, ALP, or transaminases suggest a CBD stone. CBD dilation > 6 mm on US warrants further evaluation (MRCP, EUS, or ERCP).

3. **Ignoring gallstone pancreatitis.** Check lipase in all patients with biliary colic presentation. Gallstone pancreatitis requires admission, NPO, and likely ERCP.

4. **Inferior STEMI misdiagnosed as biliary colic.** Epigastric pain from inferior MI mimics biliary colic. Obtain ECG in all patients with epigastric or RUQ pain, especially with risk factors.

5. **Failing to refer for cholecystectomy.** Biliary colic recurs in 50% of patients within 1 year. Without cholecystectomy, 2-3% per year develop serious complications (cholecystitis, pancreatitis, cholangitis). Surgical referral is standard of care.

6. **Acalculous cholecystitis missed because US shows no stones.** In critically ill, diabetic, or immunocompromised patients, acalculous cholecystitis can present similarly. HIDA scan is diagnostic (EF < 35%).
