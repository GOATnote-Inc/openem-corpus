# Central Venous Access

## Recognition

**Indications:**
- Vasopressor administration (norepinephrine, vasopressin, epinephrine infusions)
- No peripheral IV access obtainable (failed PIV, IO not available or contraindicated)
- Central venous pressure monitoring
- Transvenous pacing wire placement
- Large-volume resuscitation via introducer sheath (cordis)
- Administration of hypertonic or caustic medications (TPN, >10% dextrose, calcium chloride via central)
- Hemodialysis access
- Pulmonary artery catheter placement

**Site Selection:**

| Site | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Internal jugular (IJ) | US-guided access reliable; compressible if arterial puncture; lower pneumothorax than subclavian | Higher infection rate than subclavian; difficult in C-spine immobilization; interferes with tracheostomy |
| Subclavian | Lowest infection rate; lowest DVT rate; comfortable for patient | Highest pneumothorax risk (1.5%); non-compressible — avoid in coagulopathy; difficult US guidance |
| Femoral | Fastest access; no pneumothorax risk; no interference with CPR | Highest infection rate; highest DVT rate; difficult to maintain sterility; not suitable for CVP monitoring |

**Contraindications (site-specific):**
- IJ: ipsilateral carotid disease, prior neck surgery/radiation, C-spine immobilization (relative)
- Subclavian: coagulopathy (INR > 1.5, platelets < 50K), bilateral pneumothorax risk, ipsilateral chest trauma
- Femoral: femoral vascular grafts, inguinal infection, need for ambulation
- All sites: overlying infection at insertion site

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Ultrasound identification of vessel | Before needle insertion |
| Full barrier precautions | Every insertion |
| Guidewire on screen or palpable | Before dilation |
| Post-procedure CXR (IJ/subclavian) | Within 1 hour |
| Line functional confirmation | Aspiration of dark blood from all ports |

1. **Ultrasound-guided technique** is standard of care for IJ and femoral; strongly recommended for subclavian
2. **Full sterile barrier precautions** — cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves, large sterile drape
3. **Chlorhexidine skin prep** — 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol; allow to dry for 30 seconds
4. **Modified Seldinger technique** — needle → guidewire → dilator → catheter
5. **Confirm wire position** with ultrasound before dilation
6. **Post-procedure CXR** for IJ and subclavian (rule out pneumothorax, confirm tip at cavoatrial junction)

## Differential Diagnosis

**Alternative Vascular Access Options:**

| Alternative | When to Use Instead |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Intraosseous (IO) | Immediate access in arrest or peri-arrest; faster than CVC |
| Ultrasound-guided peripheral IV | Adequate for most medications; less invasive |
| Midline catheter | Intermediate duration access; lower complication rate |
| PICC line | Longer-term access (days to weeks); requires specialized insertion team |
| Arterial line | Hemodynamic monitoring (not for infusions) |
| Venous cutdown | When all percutaneous access fails |

## Workup

**Pre-Procedure Assessment:**
- Coagulation status: INR, platelets, PTT (correct if INR > 2.0 or platelets < 20K for elective; may proceed in emergencies regardless)
- Ultrasound survey of target vessel: confirm patency, rule out thrombus, identify anatomy
- Review for prior central lines, PICC lines, or port-a-cath at the target site
- Allergies: chlorhexidine, lidocaine, latex

**Equipment (Central Line Kit + Supplies):**

| Item | Specification |
|------|---------------|
| Central venous catheter | Triple-lumen 7 Fr x 20 cm (IJ/subclavian) or 7 Fr x 25 cm (femoral); or 8.5 Fr introducer sheath |
| Guidewire | J-tipped, 0.035-inch, 45-60 cm |
| Dilator | Matched to catheter size |
| Syringe | 10 mL for aspiration |
| Needle | 18g finder needle or micropuncture kit (21g needle + 0.018-inch wire) |
| Ultrasound | Linear high-frequency probe (10-12 MHz) with sterile probe cover |
| Sterile supplies | Gown, gloves, cap, mask, full-body drape, chlorhexidine |
| Lidocaine | 1% lidocaine, 5-10 mL with 25g needle for local anesthesia |
| Sterile saline flush | For each lumen |
| Suture | 3-0 silk on Keith needle |
| Sterile dressing | Chlorhexidine-impregnated transparent dressing |

## Treatment

### Internal Jugular Vein — Ultrasound-Guided (Preferred Site for ED)

**Step 1: Position**
- Head of bed flat or slight Trendelenburg (5-10 degrees)
- Turn head slightly contralateral (< 40 degrees — excessive rotation collapses the IJ over the carotid)
- Identify IJ with ultrasound: compressible, thin-walled, lateral and superficial to carotid artery

**Step 2: Prep and Drape**
- Chlorhexidine scrub x 30 seconds, allow to dry
- Full barrier drape exposing only the insertion site
- Sterile probe cover on ultrasound transducer

**Step 3: Local Anesthesia**
- Lidocaine 1% 3-5 mL SC over insertion site and along anticipated needle track

**Step 4: Needle Insertion (Short-Axis, Out-of-Plane)**
- 18g needle on 10 mL syringe at 30-45 degree angle
- Insert under US guidance, keeping needle tip in the ultrasound plane
- Aspirate while advancing — dark venous blood confirms entry
- Alternative: long-axis (in-plane) approach for full needle visualization

**Step 5: Guidewire**
- Advance J-wire through needle — should pass without resistance
- Confirm wire in IJ with ultrasound (visualize wire in vessel lumen)
- Advance wire to 20 cm mark; monitor for ectopy on cardiac monitor (wire touching the heart)
- Remove needle, holding wire at all times

**Step 6: Dilate and Insert Catheter**
- Nick skin at wire entry with scalpel
- Advance dilator over wire with gentle twisting motion; do not advance dilator to hub (risk of vessel injury)
- Remove dilator, thread catheter over wire
- Advance catheter to appropriate depth: right IJ 14-16 cm, left IJ 17-19 cm
- Remove wire, aspirate blood from all lumens, flush with saline

**Step 7: Secure and Confirm**
- Suture catheter to skin at 2 points
- Apply chlorhexidine dressing
- CXR: confirm tip at cavoatrial junction (T4-T5 level); rule out pneumothorax

### Subclavian Vein — Infraclavicular Approach

**Landmarks:** insertion point 1-2 cm inferior to junction of middle and medial thirds of clavicle; aim needle toward sternal notch, passing under clavicle
**Depth:** needle walks under clavicle, enters vein at 3-5 cm depth
**Catheter depth:** right subclavian 15-17 cm, left subclavian 17-19 cm
**Key risk:** pneumothorax (1.5%) — always obtain post-procedure CXR

### Femoral Vein

**Landmarks:** NAVEL (nerve-artery-vein-empty space-lymphatics, lateral to medial); femoral vein is medial to femoral artery at level of inguinal ligament
**US-guided:** linear probe in short axis; vein is compressible, medial to artery
**Depth:** typically 2-4 cm
**Catheter depth:** 25 cm to reach IVC for reliable CVP
**Key advantage:** fastest to place; no pneumothorax risk; can perform during CPR

### Post-Procedure
- Aspirate and flush all lumens with saline
- CXR within 1 hour (IJ, subclavian) — confirm tip position, rule out pneumothorax
- Document: site, number of attempts, complications, catheter type and depth
- Daily assessment: necessity review, site inspection, dressing changes per protocol

## Disposition

- **Successful placement:** continue ongoing care; daily line necessity review
- **Arterial puncture (IJ/femoral):** remove needle, hold direct pressure x 10 minutes; abort and choose alternate site
- **Arterial puncture (subclavian):** non-compressible — if catheter or dilator passed into artery, do NOT remove; obtain vascular surgery consultation for controlled removal
- **Pneumothorax post-subclavian/IJ:** CXR; if symptomatic or > 20%, tube thoracostomy; if small and stable, serial CXR and observation
- **Guidewire loss:** immediate fluoroscopy or CXR to locate; interventional radiology retrieval

## Pitfalls

1. **Inserting a central line without ultrasound guidance.** Landmark-based IJ cannulation has a 10-15% failure rate and significant carotid puncture risk. Real-time ultrasound guidance reduces complications by 57% and increases first-pass success from 64% to 82%. Ultrasound is standard of care for IJ and femoral access.

2. **Breaking sterile technique during an emergency.** Line infections are a leading cause of preventable ICU mortality (CLABSI mortality 12-25%). Even in emergencies, full barrier precautions (cap, mask, gown, gloves, large drape) and chlorhexidine prep take < 2 minutes. Lines placed without full precautions should be replaced within 48 hours.

3. **Advancing the dilator to its hub.** The dilator only needs to enter the vessel wall to create a tract — advancing it fully risks posterior wall perforation, pneumothorax, or vascular injury. Advance the dilator 2-3 cm past the skin into the vessel, then remove.

4. **Losing the guidewire.** If the wire is released and advances fully into the vessel, it migrates centrally and may embolize to the heart. Maintain grip on the proximal wire at all times. If lost, immediate imaging and interventional radiology retrieval.

5. **Placing subclavian CVC in a coagulopathic patient.** The subclavian vessels are non-compressible behind the clavicle. Arterial puncture in a coagulopathic patient (INR > 1.5, platelets < 50K) at this site leads to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Use IJ or femoral in coagulopathy.

6. **Not confirming wire position with ultrasound before dilation.** The wire may be in the carotid artery, subcutaneous tissue, or extravascular space. A few seconds of US confirmation before dilating prevents catastrophic arterial dilation. Confirm venous placement by visualizing the wire in the target vessel.
