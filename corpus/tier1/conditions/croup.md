# Croup

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute viral laryngotracheobronchitis causing subglottic airway edema and obstruction. Most common cause of acute upper airway obstruction in children aged 6 months to 3 years (peak incidence 1-2 years).

**Etiology:**
- Parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 (75% of cases)
- RSV, influenza A/B, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus
- Seasonal: fall and early winter peaks (parainfluenza type 1)

**Classic Presentation:**
- 1-2 days of URI prodrome (rhinorrhea, mild cough, low-grade fever)
- Barking (seal-like) cough — hallmark symptom
- Inspiratory stridor (at rest in moderate-severe cases)
- Hoarseness
- Symptoms worse at night (cool night air can paradoxically improve symptoms)
- Low-grade fever (38-39°C); high fever (> 39°C) suggests bacterial complication or alternative diagnosis

**Westley Croup Score (severity grading):**
- **Level of consciousness:** normal (0), altered (5)
- **Cyanosis:** none (0), with agitation (4), at rest (5)
- **Stridor:** none (0), with agitation (1), at rest (2)
- **Air entry:** normal (0), decreased (1), markedly decreased (2)
- **Retractions:** none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), severe (3)
- Total: ≤ 2 mild, 3-7 moderate, 8-11 severe, ≥ 12 impending respiratory failure

**Severity Classification:**
- **Mild:** barking cough, no stridor at rest, no retractions at rest
- **Moderate:** stridor at rest, chest wall retractions, no agitation or altered consciousness
- **Severe:** stridor at rest, marked retractions, agitation/lethargy, decreased air entry, possible cyanosis

## Critical Actions

1. **Minimize agitation** — keep child in parent's arms, avoid painful procedures (IV placement, blood draws) unless necessary. Crying worsens subglottic edema and obstruction.
2. **Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO/IM (single dose, max 10 mg)** — for ALL severities (mild, moderate, severe). PO preferred if tolerating. Onset 2-4 hours; works for 24-48 hours. Single dose is sufficient.
3. **Moderate-severe croup (stridor at rest):** add nebulized racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% solution in 3 mL NS, or L-epinephrine 5 mL of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) nebulized undiluted.
4. **Observe 2-4 hours after racemic epinephrine** — rebound stridor can occur as epinephrine effect wears off (onset 30 min, duration 1-2 hours). If stridor recurs at rest, repeat nebulized epinephrine and reassess.
5. **Severe/impending respiratory failure:** prepare for advanced airway management. Use an ETT 0.5-1 mm smaller than age-predicted size (subglottic edema narrows the airway). Call anesthesiology/ENT for difficult airway support.
6. **Humidified air/mist therapy:** no evidence of benefit (Cochrane review), but commonly used and causes no harm. Do not delay definitive treatment for mist.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Epiglottitis | Toxic-appearing, high fever, drooling, tripod/sniffing position, muffled (not hoarse) voice, NO barking cough, rapid onset (hours), refusal to swallow. Now rare post-Hib vaccine. Lateral neck X-ray: thumbprint sign. Do NOT examine oropharynx (risk of complete obstruction). |
| Bacterial tracheitis | Toxic-appearing, high fever, poor response to standard croup treatment (epinephrine/steroids), purulent secretions, often follows viral croup by days. Staphylococcus aureus most common. Requires IV antibiotics and possible airway intervention. |
| Foreign body aspiration | Sudden onset in well child (no prodrome), unilateral wheeze or decreased breath sounds, history of choking episode, age 6 months to 3 years. AP/lateral neck and chest films. Rigid bronchoscopy for removal. |
| Retropharyngeal abscess | Fever, neck stiffness/torticollis, drooling, muffled voice, refusal to swallow, neck swelling. Lateral neck X-ray: prevertebral soft tissue widening > 7 mm at C2 or > 14 mm at C6 (child). CT neck with contrast for confirmation. |
| Peritonsillar abscess | Older child/adolescent, unilateral tonsillar swelling, uvular deviation, trismus, hot potato voice, drooling |
| Angioedema | No fever, no prodrome, lip/tongue/face swelling, history of allergen exposure or ACE inhibitor use, urticaria |
| Laryngomalacia | Chronic inspiratory stridor since birth, worse with feeding/crying, no fever, no acute onset |

## Workup

**Croup is a clinical diagnosis. Routine labs and imaging are NOT required for typical presentations.**

**AP Neck Radiograph (if diagnosis uncertain):**
- Steeple sign: subglottic narrowing on AP view (present in ~50% of croup cases; not sensitive or specific enough to be required)
- Useful to exclude epiglottitis (thumbprint sign), foreign body, retropharyngeal abscess

**Lateral Neck Radiograph:**
- If concern for epiglottitis (thumbprint sign), retropharyngeal abscess (prevertebral widening)

**Pulse Oximetry:**
- Continuous monitoring in moderate-severe cases
- Hypoxemia (SpO2 < 92%) is a late finding indicating severe obstruction

**Labs:**
- Rarely needed for uncomplicated croup
- CBC, blood culture if toxic-appearing (concern for bacterial tracheitis or epiglottitis)
- Viral panel (research interest; does not change management)

## Treatment

**Mild Croup (Westley score ≤ 2, no stridor at rest):**
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO (single dose, max 10 mg)
- Can use oral prednisolone 1-2 mg/kg PO if dexamethasone unavailable (less evidence, shorter duration of action — may need repeat dosing)
- Observe for 30-60 min to confirm no progression
- Discharge with education

**Moderate Croup (Westley score 3-7, stridor at rest):**
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO or IM (single dose, max 10 mg)
- Nebulized racemic epinephrine 0.5 mL of 2.25% in 3 mL NS
  - OR L-epinephrine 5 mL of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) nebulized
- Observe 2-4 hours after epinephrine
- May repeat epinephrine q15-20 min for up to 3 doses if stridor persists at rest
- If stable after observation: discharge. If recurrent stridor at rest: admit.

**Severe Croup (Westley score ≥ 8):**
- Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg IM (single dose, max 10 mg)
- Nebulized racemic epinephrine — repeat q15-20 min as needed
- Heliox (70% helium / 30% oxygen): lower density than air, reduces turbulent flow through narrowed airway. Use only if FiO2 requirement ≤ 0.30.
- Prepare for intubation — ETT 0.5-1 mm smaller than age-predicted (age/4 + 4 for uncuffed). Have smaller backup tube ready.
- Call anesthesiology and/or ENT for airway support
- Budesonide 2 mg nebulized: alternative to dexamethasone if vomiting prevents PO dosing and IM not feasible. Onset is slower (2-4 hours).

**Medications Summary:**
| Drug | Dose | Route | Notes |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| Dexamethasone | 0.6 mg/kg (max 10 mg) | PO, IM, IV | Single dose. First-line corticosteroid. |
| Racemic epinephrine | 0.5 mL of 2.25% in 3 mL NS | Nebulized | Onset 10-30 min, duration 1-2 hours |
| L-epinephrine | 5 mL of 1:1000 (1 mg/mL) | Nebulized | Equivalent efficacy to racemic epi |
| Budesonide | 2 mg | Nebulized | Alternative if PO/IM dexamethasone not feasible |
| Prednisolone | 1-2 mg/kg | PO | If dexamethasone unavailable |

## Disposition

**Discharge (majority of cases):**
- Mild croup after dexamethasone administration (observe 30-60 min)
- Moderate croup that resolves with dexamethasone + single dose epinephrine AND no recurrence of stridor at rest during 2-4 hour observation
- Parents educated on: symptoms may persist 3-5 days, worse at night; return for stridor at rest, respiratory distress, drooling, poor feeding, cyanosis, or altered mental status
- No prescription needed (dexamethasone single dose given in ED is sufficient)

**Admission:**
- Recurrent stridor at rest after epinephrine wears off (despite dexamethasone)
- Need for > 2 doses of nebulized epinephrine
- Persistent respiratory distress after treatment
- SpO2 < 92% on room air
- Toxic appearance (concern for bacterial tracheitis)
- Unreliable follow-up, inability to return if symptoms worsen
- Age < 6 months (smaller airway, higher risk of decompensation)

**ICU Admission:**
- Severe croup unresponsive to epinephrine
- Impending respiratory failure
- Need for intubation or advanced airway management
- Bacterial tracheitis (requires IV antibiotics and possible surgical airway intervention)

## Pitfalls

1. **Agitating the child with unnecessary procedures.** Crying increases airway turbulence and worsens obstruction. Avoid IV placement, blood draws, and invasive exams in a child with stridor unless critical. Keep the child calm in the parent's lap. Pulse oximetry and clinical observation are sufficient for most cases.

2. **Not giving dexamethasone for mild croup.** Mild croup still benefits from a single dose of dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg PO. Cochrane meta-analysis demonstrates reduced return visits, reduced need for epinephrine, and shorter symptom duration even in mild cases. There is no severity threshold below which steroids are not indicated.

3. **Discharging too soon after racemic epinephrine.** Epinephrine effect peaks at 30 minutes and wears off in 1-2 hours. Rebound stridor occurs as the medication's vasoconstrictive effect on subglottic mucosa resolves. A minimum 2-hour observation (ideally 3-4 hours) after the last epinephrine dose is required before discharge.

4. **Missing epiglottitis.** Epiglottitis is rare post-Hib vaccine but still occurs (non-typeable H. influenzae, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and in unvaccinated children). Key distinguishing features: toxic appearance, drooling, tripod/sniffing position, muffled voice, NO barking cough, rapid progression. Do NOT examine the oropharynx — can precipitate complete airway obstruction. If suspected, secure airway in the OR with ENT/anesthesiology.

5. **Missing bacterial tracheitis.** Bacterial tracheitis (membranous croup) often presents after apparent viral croup that worsens despite appropriate treatment. High fever, toxic appearance, copious purulent secretions, and failure to improve with epinephrine and steroids should prompt suspicion. Requires IV antibiotics (vancomycin + ceftriaxone) and possible bronchoscopy for membrane removal.

6. **Forgetting foreign body aspiration in the differential.** Sudden onset of stridor/cough without preceding URI or fever in a toddler should raise immediate concern for foreign body aspiration. The classic triad of choking, coughing, and wheezing is present in only ~50% of cases. AP and lateral neck films, inspiratory/expiratory chest films (or bilateral decubitus in young children), and rigid bronchoscopy if suspicious.

7. **Using an age-predicted ETT size if intubation is required.** Subglottic edema narrows the airway. Use an ETT 0.5-1 mm smaller than the age-predicted size. Have a tube one size smaller ready as backup. Forced intubation with a standard-sized tube causes mucosal trauma and worsens edema.

8. **Relying on the steeple sign for diagnosis.** The steeple sign (subglottic narrowing on AP neck X-ray) is present in only ~50% of croup cases and can appear in other conditions causing subglottic edema. Croup is a clinical diagnosis (barking cough, stridor, hoarseness in a febrile child age 6 months to 3 years). A normal X-ray does not exclude croup, and an abnormal one does not confirm it.

9. **Prescribing antibiotics for uncomplicated croup.** Croup is viral. Antibiotics provide no benefit and contribute to antimicrobial resistance. Antibiotics are indicated only if bacterial tracheitis, concurrent bacterial infection (AOM, pneumonia), or epiglottitis is diagnosed.
