# Chemical Eye Burn (Ocular Chemical Injury)

## Recognition

**Alkali burns (MORE DANGEROUS — liquefaction necrosis, penetrates deep):**
- Ammonia, lye (NaOH), calcium hydroxide (lime/cement), potassium hydroxide
- Saponification of cell membranes → continued penetration
- Damage may worsen for hours after exposure
- Common sources: cleaning products, industrial chemicals, airbag deployment (NaOH)

**Acid burns (less penetrating — coagulation necrosis creates barrier):**
- Sulfuric acid (battery acid), hydrochloric acid, acetic acid
- Coagulative necrosis limits further penetration (except hydrofluoric acid, which penetrates like alkali)

**Presentation:**
- Severe pain, tearing, blepharospasm
- Conjunctival injection or blanching (white eye = ischemia = severe)
- Corneal haziness or opacification
- Chemosis (conjunctival swelling)
- Decreased visual acuity
- pH abnormal on litmus testing

**Roper-Hall classification (severity grading after irrigation):**
- Grade I: corneal epithelial damage only, no limbal ischemia
- Grade II: corneal haze but iris detail visible, < 1/3 limbal ischemia
- Grade III: total corneal epithelial loss, haze obscures iris detail, 1/3-1/2 limbal ischemia
- Grade IV: opaque cornea, > 1/2 limbal ischemia — worst prognosis

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Copious irrigation | IMMEDIATELY — before any other assessment |
| pH testing | After initial irrigation; continue until pH 7.0-7.4 |
| Visual acuity | After irrigation and pH normalization |
| Ophthalmology consultation | Immediate for Grade II-IV |

1. **IRRIGATE IMMEDIATELY** — do NOT delay for history, visual acuity, or exam. This is the single most important intervention.
2. **Morgan lens** (preferred) or manual irrigation with 1-2 L NS or LR per eye; sweep fornices with cotton swab to remove particulate matter (especially lime/cement)
3. **Topical anesthetic FIRST:** proparacaine 0.5% 1-2 drops to affected eye (allows patient to open eye for irrigation)
4. **Check pH** with litmus paper on inferior fornix after initial 1 L irrigation; continue until pH 7.0-7.4
5. **Recheck pH 15-30 minutes after stopping irrigation** (alkaline particles may continue to dissolve)
6. **Complete exam after irrigation:** visual acuity, slit lamp (corneal clarity, limbal ischemia, anterior chamber reaction), IOP
7. **Evert upper eyelid** — remove any retained particulate matter
8. **Ophthalmology consultation** — same-day for Grade II; emergent for Grade III-IV

## Differential Diagnosis

- Thermal burn (flame, hot liquid — history differentiates)
- Ultraviolet keratitis (welding, tanning bed — bilateral, delayed onset 6-12 hours)
- Corneal abrasion (mechanical injury, no chemical exposure)
- Acute angle-closure glaucoma (fixed mid-dilated pupil, high IOP, halos)
- Allergic conjunctivitis (bilateral itching, no chemical exposure)
- Viral conjunctivitis (watery discharge, preauricular lymphadenopathy)

## Workup

- **pH testing:** before and after irrigation; goal pH 7.0-7.4
- **Visual acuity:** after irrigation — baseline and for prognosis
- **Slit lamp exam:** fluorescein staining (corneal epithelial defect), limbal ischemia assessment (white = ischemic segments), anterior chamber cell/flare, lens clarity
- **IOP measurement:** elevated IOP from inflammation or ciliary body damage
- **Evert eyelids:** inspect fornices for retained particulate matter
- **Fundoscopy:** if posterior segment visualization possible (often obscured by corneal opacification)

## Treatment

### Immediate (ED)
- **Proparacaine 0.5% 1-2 drops** — topical anesthesia to facilitate irrigation
- **Copious irrigation:** 1-2 L NS or LR per eye through Morgan lens or IV tubing directed at eye; minimum 30 minutes continuous for alkali burns
- **Sweep fornices** with cotton-tipped applicator moistened with saline to remove particulate matter
- **pH recheck** 15-30 minutes after irrigation stops; repeat irrigation if pH not neutral (7.0-7.4)

### After Irrigation (Grade-Dependent)
**All grades:**
- **Erythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment** — apply to affected eye QID (prophylaxis)
- **Cycloplegic:** cyclopentolate 1% 1 drop to affected eye BID (pain relief, prevents synechiae)
- **Oral analgesic:** acetaminophen 1000 mg PO q6h or ibuprofen 600 mg PO q6h

**Grade II-IV:**
- **Prednisolone acetate 1% ophthalmic drops** — 1 drop q1-2h while awake (first 7-10 days only; then taper — prolonged use impairs re-epithelialization)
- **Ascorbic acid 10% ophthalmic drops** — 1 drop q2h while awake (promotes collagen synthesis, reduces corneal melting)
- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID** — anti-collagenase activity (reduces corneal stromal melting)
- **Oral ascorbic acid 500 mg PO QID** — systemic collagen support

**Grade IV:**
- Emergent ophthalmology consultation for possible amniotic membrane transplantation, limbal stem cell transplantation, or penetrating keratoplasty
- **IOP management:** timolol 0.5% 1 drop BID if IOP > 21 mmHg; avoid prostaglandin analogs (increase inflammation)

### Do NOT Use
- **Topical NSAID drops** — impair epithelial healing
- **Patching** — increases infection risk with chemical burns
- **Neutralizing agents** — exothermic reaction worsens injury; use water/saline only

## Disposition

- **Grade I:** Discharge with erythromycin ointment, cycloplegic, ophthalmology follow-up in 24-48 hours
- **Grade II:** Discharge with above plus topical steroid, ascorbic acid, doxycycline; ophthalmology follow-up in 24 hours
- **Grade III-IV:** Ophthalmology consultation in ED; likely admission for surgical intervention and hourly topical medications
- **Bilateral severe burns:** Admission for nursing support (patient cannot self-administer drops)
- **All patients:** strict return precautions for vision change, increasing pain, discharge

## Pitfalls

1. **Delaying irrigation for any reason (history, triage, visual acuity, pH check, consent).** Irrigation must begin within minutes of arrival. Even a 5-minute delay worsens outcomes in alkali burns. The triage nurse should begin irrigation before the physician sees the patient.

2. **Stopping irrigation too early.** Alkali chemicals (especially cement/lime particles) continue to dissolve and release base for hours. After initial irrigation, recheck pH at 15-30 minutes; if pH drifts above 7.4, resume irrigation.

3. **Interpreting a "white and quiet" eye as mild.** A white, painless eye after chemical exposure indicates severe limbal ischemia with vascular blanching — this is Grade III-IV (worst prognosis), not a mild injury. Pain sensation is lost because nerve endings are destroyed.

4. **Not removing particulate matter from the fornices.** Lime, cement, and plaster particles lodge under the eyelids and continue to release alkali. Evert both eyelids and sweep the fornices with a moistened cotton swab during irrigation.

5. **Using topical steroids beyond 10-14 days.** Short-term topical steroids reduce inflammation, but prolonged use inhibits collagen synthesis, impairs re-epithelialization, and increases the risk of corneal perforation.
