# Leptospirosis

## Recognition

**Biphasic illness:**
- **Phase 1 (Septicemic, days 3-7):** Abrupt onset high fever, severe headache, myalgia (especially calves and lumbar region), conjunctival suffusion (hallmark — red eyes without exudate), nausea, vomiting
- **Phase 2 (Immune, days 6-12):** Resolution then recurrence of fever, meningitis, uveitis

**Severe form (Weil disease, 5-10% of cases):**
- Jaundice (conjugated hyperbilirubinemia)
- Acute kidney injury (oliguric or non-oliguric; hypokalemia characteristic)
- Hemorrhagic manifestations (pulmonary hemorrhage, GI bleeding, petechiae)
- Myocarditis, cardiac arrhythmias
- Pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome (LPHS) — rapidly fatal; diffuse alveolar hemorrhage

**Exposure history:**
- Contact with water contaminated by animal urine (rats, dogs, livestock)
- Flooding, sewage exposure, recreational water sports
- Agricultural workers, veterinarians, military personnel
- Travel to tropical/subtropical regions
- Incubation: 2-30 days (average 7-12)

## Critical Actions

1. **Start empiric antibiotics immediately** if Weil disease suspected — do not wait for confirmatory serology
2. **IV penicillin G 1.5 million units q6h** for severe disease OR ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h
3. **Aggressive fluid resuscitation** — AKI is common and often reversible
4. **Monitor for pulmonary hemorrhage** — can be rapidly fatal; intubation and lung-protective ventilation may be needed
5. **Renal replacement therapy** (hemodialysis) for severe AKI unresponsive to fluids
6. **Warn about Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction** — may occur within hours of first antibiotic dose

## Differential Diagnosis

- Dengue fever — similar presentation in endemic areas; thrombocytopenia, hemoconcentration; no jaundice typically
- Malaria — periodic fevers, travel to endemic area, thick/thin blood smear
- Viral hepatitis — jaundice with transaminases > 1000 (leptospirosis typically < 200)
- Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — pulmonary edema, thrombocytopenia, rodent exposure
- Scrub typhus, murine typhus — eschar, rash; responds to doxycycline
- Yellow fever — travel history, vaccination status
- Meningococcemia — purpura, rapid hemodynamic collapse

## Workup

- **Serology: Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT)** — gold standard; requires paired sera (acute + convalescent 2+ weeks later); 4-fold rise or single titer >= 1:800 in endemic area
- **Leptospira IgM ELISA** — available faster; useful for initial diagnosis
- **Leptospira PCR** (blood, urine, CSF) — most useful in first week of illness
- **Blood culture** for Leptospira — low sensitivity, slow growth (weeks)
- **CBC:** Leukocytosis with left shift, thrombocytopenia
- **BMP:** Elevated creatinine, hypokalemia (characteristic of leptospiral AKI, unlike most AKI)
- **Hepatic panel:** Elevated conjugated bilirubin (often disproportionately high relative to transaminases); AST/ALT typically < 200
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR mildly prolonged
- **Urinalysis:** Proteinuria, hematuria, pyuria, granular casts
- **CXR:** Diffuse alveolar infiltrates if pulmonary hemorrhage
- **CSF (if meningitis):** Lymphocytic or neutrophilic pleocytosis, mildly elevated protein
- **ECG:** Arrhythmias, ST-T changes if myocarditis

## Treatment

### Severe Leptospirosis (Weil Disease)
- **Penicillin G 1.5 million units IV q6h x 7 days** (traditional first-line)
- **OR Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h x 7 days** (equally effective, more convenient)
- **OR Cefotaxime 1 g IV q6h x 7 days**
- Start immediately — do not await diagnostic confirmation

### Mild Leptospirosis
- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 7 days** (preferred oral agent)
- **OR Amoxicillin 500 mg PO TID x 7 days**
- **OR Azithromycin 500 mg PO day 1, then 250 mg PO daily x 4 days** (alternative)

### Supportive Care
- IV crystalloid resuscitation for AKI (target UOP > 0.5 mL/kg/hr)
- Hemodialysis for severe AKI (oliguric failure, hyperkalemia, acidosis, fluid overload)
- Vasopressors for septic shock
- Mechanical ventilation for LPHS (lung-protective strategy, low tidal volumes)
- Platelet transfusion if active bleeding with severe thrombocytopenia
- Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction: NSAIDs, supportive care; typically self-limited

### Chemoprophylaxis
- Doxycycline 200 mg PO once weekly during high-risk exposure (military, flooding)

## Disposition

- **Weil disease/severe leptospirosis:** ICU admission
- **Mild leptospirosis:** May discharge with oral doxycycline if stable, able to follow up in 48h
- **Isolation:** Standard precautions (not person-to-person transmitted in clinical settings)
- **Reportable:** Leptospirosis is nationally notifiable in the US (added 2014)
- **Return precautions:** Worsening jaundice, decreased urine output, hemoptysis, altered mentation

## Pitfalls

1. **Dismissing leptospirosis because the patient is not jaundiced.** Only 5-10% of cases develop Weil disease. Anicteric leptospirosis is far more common and presents as undifferentiated fever with myalgia.

2. **Not asking about water exposure history.** Leptospirosis requires inoculation through mucous membranes or abraded skin from contaminated water. Travel, flooding, occupational, and recreational water exposure are critical history elements.

3. **Misdiagnosing as viral hepatitis.** Leptospirosis produces conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with mildly elevated transaminases (< 200). Viral hepatitis typically shows transaminases > 1000. This distinction is clinically useful.

4. **Expecting hyperkalemia with AKI.** Leptospiral nephritis characteristically causes hypokalemia due to proximal tubular dysfunction, unlike most causes of AKI. Monitor potassium closely and replace aggressively.

5. **Not preparing for Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.** Spirochetal lysis after first antibiotic dose can cause fever, rigors, hypotension. Warn the patient and monitor closely in the first 6 hours.

6. **Missing pulmonary hemorrhage.** Leptospiral pulmonary hemorrhagic syndrome has > 50% mortality. Any hemoptysis or unexplained diffuse infiltrates in a febrile patient with exposure history should prompt consideration.
