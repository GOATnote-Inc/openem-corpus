# Penetrating Chest Trauma

## Recognition

**Pathophysiology:** Penetrating injury to the thorax disrupts the chest wall, pleural space, lung parenchyma, mediastinal structures, or diaphragm. Mechanism determines injury pattern: gunshot wounds (GSW) cause blast effect with wider tissue destruction and higher mortality than stab wounds (SW), which produce lower-energy, more predictable injury tracks. 15-30% of penetrating chest injuries require operative intervention vs. <10% of blunt chest trauma.

**Immediate Life Threats:**
- **Tension pneumothorax** — one-way valve air leak, obstructive shock, absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation (late)
- **Massive hemothorax** — >1500 mL blood in pleural space, dullness to percussion, hypotension, absent breath sounds
- **Cardiac tamponade** — blood in pericardium, Beck's triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, JVD), PEA arrest
- **Open pneumothorax** — sucking chest wound, defect >2/3 tracheal diameter compromises ventilation
- **Air embolism** — penetrating lung injury with concurrent positive-pressure ventilation, sudden cardiovascular collapse
- **Tracheobronchial injury** — massive air leak, persistent pneumothorax despite chest tube, subcutaneous emphysema

**The Cardiac Box:**
Wounds between the sternal notch and xiphoid, bounded laterally by the nipples (or midclavicular lines), carry high risk of cardiac injury. Any hemodynamically unstable patient with a penetrating wound in the box has cardiac injury until proven otherwise. Stab wounds in the box: 15-20% cardiac injury rate. GSW traversing the box: assume cardiac injury.

**Transmediastinal Trajectory:**
Any penetrating wound with entrance/exit suggesting trajectory across the midline is a surgical emergency. Structures at risk: heart, great vessels, esophagus, trachea, thoracic spine.

**Classic Presentations by Mechanism:**
- **Stab wound:** more predictable trajectory, more likely isolated injury, better survival (mortality 1-2% for isolated SW vs. 10-15% for GSW)
- **GSW:** higher energy transfer, cavitation injury, multiple organ involvement, fragment trajectory unpredictable
- **Shotgun:** close range causes massive tissue destruction; long range may cause scattered superficial injuries

**High-Risk Anatomic Zones:**
- Precordial/cardiac box: heart, great vessels
- Zone I neck to thoracic inlet: subclavian vessels, aortic arch
- Posterior mediastinum: esophagus, descending aorta, thoracic duct
- Thoracoabdominal region (nipple line to costal margin): diaphragm, liver, spleen — must exclude abdominal injury

## Critical Actions

1. **Primary survey (ATLS)** — ABCDE approach. Identify and treat tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, and cardiac tamponade during the primary survey. Do not wait for imaging.

2. **Needle/finger decompression for tension pneumothorax** — 14g angiocatheter 2nd ICS midclavicular line or finger thoracostomy 5th ICS anterior axillary line. Perform before CXR in the unstable patient.

3. **Tube thoracostomy** — 36-40 Fr chest tube, 5th ICS anterior axillary line (safe triangle). Record initial output and ongoing drainage rate. Threshold for thoracotomy: initial output >1500 mL OR ongoing >200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours.

4. **Resuscitative thoracotomy (EDT)** — Perform for witnessed penetrating thoracic arrest or peri-arrest. Left anterolateral thoracotomy in the 5th ICS. Goals: relieve tamponade, cross-clamp descending aorta, control cardiac hemorrhage, open cardiac massage. Survival: 10-15% penetrating cardiac, 35% isolated cardiac stab wound with tamponade. Contraindicated: blunt trauma without signs of life, >15 min CPR (penetrating torso), >5 min CPR (penetrating neck/extremity).

5. **Pericardiocentesis/pericardial window** — For suspected tamponade when EDT is not immediately available or in the hemodynamically compromised (not arrested) patient. Subxiphoid approach under ultrasound guidance. Aspiration of even 15-20 mL can improve hemodynamics. Pericardial window is definitive for diagnosis.

6. **Occlude open pneumothorax** — Three-sided occlusive dressing (vented chest seal) or commercial vented chest seal device. Definitive management: tube thoracostomy remote from the wound, then wound debridement and closure.

7. **Massive transfusion protocol** — Activate early. 1:1:1 ratio (pRBC:FFP:platelets). Permissive hypotension (target SBP 80-90 mmHg) until surgical hemorrhage control, except in TBI. TXA 1 g IV over 10 min within 3 hours of injury.

## Differential Diagnosis

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Tension pneumothorax | Hyperresonance, absent breath sounds, tracheal deviation, obstructive shock; POCUS: absent lung sliding |
| Massive hemothorax | Dullness to percussion, absent breath sounds, hemorrhagic shock; POCUS: anechoic fluid above diaphragm |
| Cardiac tamponade | Beck's triad, PEA arrest, bilateral breath sounds; POCUS: pericardial effusion, RV diastolic collapse |
| Diaphragmatic rupture | Bowel sounds in chest, NG tube in thorax on CXR, thoracoabdominal wound |
| Great vessel injury | Widened mediastinum, hemodynamic instability out of proportion to chest tube output, expanding mediastinal hematoma on CT |
| Tracheobronchial injury | Massive continuous air leak, persistent pneumothorax despite well-placed chest tube, extensive subcutaneous emphysema |
| Esophageal perforation | Mediastinal air, left pleural effusion, pain out of proportion; high index of suspicion for transmediastinal wounds |
| Pulmonary contusion | Parenchymal opacification on CXR/CT, hypoxia, worsens over 24-48 hours; common with GSW blast effect |

## Workup

**Primary Survey Imaging:**
- **CXR (portable AP)** — first-line after initial stabilization. Identifies pneumothorax, hemothorax, mediastinal widening, missile/fragment location. Upright preferred; supine misses up to 500 mL hemothorax.
- **POCUS (eFAST)** — bedside, immediate. Evaluate for pneumothorax (absent lung sliding), hemothorax (fluid above diaphragm), pericardial effusion (subxiphoid view), and free peritoneal fluid (thoracoabdominal wounds). Sensitivity for pneumothorax: 86-98% (superior to supine CXR).
- **Do NOT delay resuscitation or intervention for imaging in the unstable patient.**

**Secondary Survey Imaging (hemodynamically stable):**
- **CT chest with IV contrast** — gold standard for stable patients. Delineates trajectory, identifies vascular injury, retained hemothorax, diaphragmatic injury. Mandatory for suspected transmediastinal trajectory.
- **CT angiography** — for suspected great vessel injury or trajectory near major vascular structures.
- **Esophagography/esophagoscopy** — for transmediastinal wounds to exclude esophageal perforation. Water-soluble contrast first, then thin barium if negative (combined sensitivity >95%).
- **Bronchoscopy** — for suspected tracheobronchial injury (persistent air leak, massive subcutaneous emphysema).

**Labs:**
- Type and crossmatch — immediate, before any other labs
- CBC, BMP, coagulation panel (PT/INR, fibrinogen)
- Lactate — marker of perfusion, trends guide resuscitation
- ABG/VBG — assess ventilation and acid-base status
- TEG/ROTEM — if available, guides component therapy in massive transfusion

## Treatment

**Immediate Interventions:**
- **Airway:** Endotracheal intubation for GCS <8, respiratory failure, or anticipated operative management. RSI with ketamine 1-2 mg/kg IV or etomidate 0.3 mg/kg IV + succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg IV or rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg IV.
- **Breathing:** Supplemental O2, bilateral needle/finger decompression if bilateral tension suspected. Tube thoracostomy (36-40 Fr) for hemothorax or pneumothorax. Autotransfusion of chest tube output when available.
- **Circulation:** Two large-bore (14-16g) IVs or IO access. Massive transfusion protocol: pRBC:FFP:platelets 1:1:1. TXA 1 g IV bolus over 10 min (within 3 hours of injury), then 1 g IV over 8 hours. Permissive hypotension (SBP 80-90 mmHg) until surgical control.

**Chest Tube Management:**
- Insertion: 5th ICS, anterior axillary line, safe triangle. Blunt dissection, finger sweep, directed posteriorly and superiorly. 36-40 Fr for hemothorax (smaller tubes clot). Connect to -20 cmH2O suction.
- Record initial output in mL and time. Monitor hourly output.
- Surgical thresholds: >1500 mL initial output OR >200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours.

**Operative Indications:**
- Initial chest tube output >1500 mL
- Ongoing output >200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours
- Cardiac tamponade
- Transmediastinal trajectory with hemodynamic instability
- Great vessel injury
- Massive air leak / tracheobronchial injury
- Diaphragmatic rupture
- Esophageal perforation
- Cardiac arrest / peri-arrest (EDT)

**Pain Management:**
- Intercostal nerve block: bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine, 5 mL per level (block 1 above and 1 below tube/wound site)
- Ketamine subdissociative: 0.3 mg/kg IV over 15 min
- Fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV q5-10min titrated to effect
- Ketorolac 15-30 mg IV (avoid in hemorrhagic shock or renal impairment)
- Acetaminophen 1 g IV

**Antibiotics:**
- Prophylactic antibiotics for tube thoracostomy in penetrating trauma: cefazolin 2 g IV (evidence mixed; follow institutional protocol)

## Disposition

**Immediate OR:**
- Hemodynamic instability unresponsive to resuscitation
- Chest tube output meeting surgical thresholds (>1500 mL initial, >200 mL/hr ongoing)
- Cardiac tamponade
- Transmediastinal trajectory with instability or positive ancillary studies
- Cardiac arrest requiring EDT
- Great vessel injury
- Tracheobronchial disruption
- Esophageal perforation
- Diaphragmatic herniation

**ICU Admission:**
- All patients post-resuscitative thoracotomy
- Hemodynamic instability requiring ongoing resuscitation
- Massive transfusion
- Bilateral chest tubes
- Significant pulmonary contusion with hypoxia
- Mechanically ventilated patients
- Post-operative monitoring

**Trauma Surgery Admission (floor/stepdown):**
- Stable patients with chest tube in place
- Isolated hemothorax or pneumothorax managed with tube thoracostomy
- Observation for delayed hemothorax (can present 6-72 hours post-injury)

**Never discharge from the ED:**
- Any patient with penetrating chest trauma requiring chest tube
- Any patient with hemodynamic instability
- Transmediastinal or cardiac box wounds even if currently stable

**Consider observation and potential discharge (rare):**
- Tangential wound not entering pleural cavity (confirmed by CT)
- Negative eFAST, normal CXR at 6 hours, hemodynamically stable throughout
- Must have reliable follow-up at 24-48 hours with repeat CXR

## Pitfalls

1. **Assuming stab wounds are "minor."** Stab wounds in the cardiac box carry a 15-20% rate of cardiac injury. A hemodynamically stable patient with a precordial stab wound can decompensate to PEA arrest within minutes from tamponade. Maintain high suspicion and obtain pericardial views on POCUS for every precordial wound.

2. **Failing to recognize transmediastinal trajectory.** Any wound with entrance and exit (or retained fragment) suggesting a path across the midline requires CT angiography, esophagography, and bronchoscopy. Missing an esophageal or great vessel injury is uniformly fatal if not identified early.

3. **Relying on supine CXR to exclude hemothorax.** Supine CXR can miss up to 500 mL of blood in the pleural space. eFAST is superior for early detection. CT is definitive. A "normal" supine CXR does not exclude significant hemothorax.

4. **Using too small a chest tube.** Small-bore tubes (24 Fr and under) clot with blood and fail to drain hemothorax. Use 36-40 Fr for traumatic hemothorax. An inadequately drained hemothorax becomes a retained hemothorax, then an empyema.

5. **Delayed activation of massive transfusion protocol.** Penetrating chest trauma with hemodynamic instability requires early MTP activation. Crystalloid resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock dilutes clotting factors and worsens coagulopathy. Push blood products 1:1:1 early.

6. **Missing the thoracoabdominal wound.** Penetrating wounds between the nipple line and costal margin can injure the diaphragm, liver, or spleen. Up to 30% of left-sided thoracoabdominal stab wounds have occult diaphragmatic injury not seen on initial imaging. These patients need laparoscopy or thoracoscopy.

7. **Performing EDT without appropriate indications.** EDT survival is mechanism-dependent: 10-15% for penetrating cardiac injury, 1-2% for blunt trauma. EDT in blunt arrest without signs of life or >10 min CPR is futile. Follow EAST/WTA selection criteria to avoid futile thoracotomy and resource expenditure.

8. **Forgetting bilateral decompression in arrest.** During resuscitation of penetrating chest trauma arrest, bilateral finger thoracostomies should be performed empirically. A tension pneumothorax on the contralateral side is easily missed and is a correctable cause of PEA.

9. **Anchoring on the entry wound and missing the exit wound or second injury.** Log-roll every penetrating trauma patient. GSW patients frequently have multiple wounds. Stab wound patients with altercation history may have additional wounds in the back, axilla, or flank that are initially occult.
