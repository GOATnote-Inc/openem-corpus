# Splenic Laceration

## Recognition

**Mechanism:** Blunt abdominal trauma (MVC, fall, sports, assault). Left upper quadrant or lower left chest wall impact. Spleen is the most commonly injured solid organ in blunt abdominal trauma.

**AAST Organ Injury Scale (2018 revision):**
- **Grade I:** Subcapsular hematoma < 10% surface area; capsular laceration < 1 cm depth
- **Grade II:** Subcapsular hematoma 10-50%; intraparenchymal hematoma < 5 cm; laceration 1-3 cm depth
- **Grade III:** Subcapsular hematoma > 50% or expanding; ruptured subcapsular/parenchymal hematoma; laceration > 3 cm depth or involving trabecular vessels. Active bleeding confined within splenic capsule.
- **Grade IV:** Laceration involving segmental or hilar vessels with > 25% devascularization. Active bleeding extending beyond spleen into peritoneum.
- **Grade V:** Shattered spleen; hilar vascular injury with complete devascularization

**Presentation:**
- Left upper quadrant pain and tenderness
- Left shoulder pain (Kehr sign — diaphragmatic irritation referred via phrenic nerve)
- Left lower rib fractures (ribs 9-12 on left) — splenic injury in 20% of left lower rib fractures
- Guarding, rebound tenderness (peritoneal signs)
- Hemorrhagic shock: tachycardia, hypotension, pallor
- Abdominal distension

**Delayed splenic rupture:** Can present 48 hours to weeks after initial injury (subcapsular hematoma expands and ruptures). Historical incidence 1-3%.

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Two large-bore IVs + resuscitation | Immediate |
| FAST exam | < 5 minutes |
| CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast | < 30 minutes (if stable) |
| Activate MTP | If hemorrhagic shock |
| Trauma surgery consult | < 30 minutes |

1. **FAST exam** — detects free fluid in LUQ (splenorenal recess). Positive FAST in unstable patient → immediate laparotomy (do not delay for CT).
2. **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast** (arterial and portal venous phases) — for hemodynamically STABLE patients only. Grades injury, identifies active extravasation (contrast blush), pseudoaneurysm.
3. **Activate massive transfusion protocol** if hemorrhagic shock: 1:1:1 PRBC:FFP:platelets
4. **TXA** 1 g IV over 10 min if within 3 hours of injury
5. **Trauma surgery consult immediately** — determines operative vs. nonoperative management

## Differential Diagnosis

- Liver laceration (right-sided, but can be bilateral injury)
- Left kidney injury (retroperitoneal, flank pain)
- Pancreatic injury (epigastric, delayed presentation with lipase elevation)
- Diaphragmatic rupture (left, often coexists)
- Rib fractures without solid organ injury
- Mesenteric injury (free fluid without solid organ injury on CT)
- Abdominal wall hematoma (rectus sheath)

## Workup

- **FAST exam:** Rapid bedside assessment — LUQ free fluid indicates splenic or left kidney injury. Sensitivity 63-100% for significant hemoperitoneum.
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:** Arterial and portal venous phases. Gold standard for grading, detecting active extravasation (blush), pseudoaneurysm, vascular pedicle injury. Sensitivity > 95% for splenic injury.
- **Labs:** CBC (serial q4-6h for 24h), BMP, type and crossmatch (at least 4 units), coagulation studies, lactate, TEG/ROTEM
- **CXR:** Left lower rib fractures, left pleural effusion (associated hemothorax)
- **Repeat FAST** at 6 hours if initial was negative but suspicion remains

## Treatment

**Nonoperative management (NOM) — standard for hemodynamically stable patients (Grade I-III and select Grade IV):**
- ICU admission with serial abdominal exams q2-4h
- Strict bed rest x 24-72 hours
- NPO initially, advance as tolerated
- Serial CBC q6h x 24h, then q12h x 24h
- Type and crossmatch maintained
- Surgical team notified and immediately available
- Success rate: 80-95% for Grades I-III

**Angioembolization:**
- Consider for Grade III-IV with active extravasation (contrast blush) or pseudoaneurysm on CT
- Proximal (main splenic artery) or distal (selective) embolization
- Can be performed as adjunct to NOM (decreases failure rate)

**Operative management — indications:**
- Hemodynamic instability despite resuscitation (positive FAST → OR, do NOT get CT)
- Failed NOM (transfusion > 2 units in 24h with ongoing bleeding, peritonitis)
- Grade V (shattered spleen)
- Associated injuries requiring laparotomy
- Peritonitis

**Surgical options:**
- **Splenorrhaphy** (repair): mesh wrap, topical hemostatic agents, partial splenectomy — for lower-grade injuries at laparotomy
- **Splenectomy:** For high-grade injuries, uncontrolled hemorrhage, or unstable patients (damage control)

**Post-splenectomy:**
- Vaccinate within 14 days (ideally before discharge): pneumococcal (PCV20 or PCV15 + PPSV23), meningococcal (MenACWY + MenB), Hib
- Lifelong risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI) — mortality 50%+
- Medic alert bracelet
- Low threshold for antibiotics with febrile illness

## Disposition

- **ICU:** Grades III-V, any patient requiring transfusion, post-embolization, post-splenectomy
- **Step-down:** Grade I-II, hemodynamically stable, declining serial hematocrits stable
- **OR:** Hemodynamic instability, failed NOM, peritonitis
- **Activity restriction post-NOM:** No contact sports for 3-6 months (risk of delayed rupture). Follow-up imaging at 3 months for high-grade injuries.
- **Transfer:** Level I/II trauma center if interventional radiology and surgical capability not available

## Pitfalls

1. **Sending an unstable patient with positive FAST to CT.** Hemodynamically unstable + positive FAST = immediate laparotomy. CT delays definitive hemorrhage control and kills.

2. **Discharging left lower rib fracture patients without evaluating for splenic injury.** Fractures of ribs 9-12 on the left are associated with splenic injury in ~20%. CT or serial observation is warranted.

3. **Not monitoring serial hematocrits during NOM.** NOM requires ICU-level monitoring. A drop of > 2 g/dL in 6 hours or need for > 2 units PRBC in 24 hours should prompt reassessment for embolization or surgery.

4. **Forgetting post-splenectomy vaccinations.** OPSI carries > 50% mortality. Vaccinations must be given within 14 days (pneumococcal, meningococcal, Hib). Document in discharge instructions and arrange primary care follow-up.

5. **Missing delayed splenic rupture.** Patients discharged after low-grade splenic injury can present days to weeks later with acute hemorrhage from expanding subcapsular hematoma. Clear return precautions: LUQ pain, lightheadedness, shoulder pain.

6. **Failing to consider angioembolization for Grade III-IV with contrast blush.** Active extravasation on CT in a stable patient is an indication for angioembolization, not continued observation alone.
