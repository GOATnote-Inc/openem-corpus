# Incarcerated Hernia

## Recognition

**Definitions:**
- **Incarcerated:** hernia contents cannot be reduced back into the abdominal cavity
- **Strangulated:** compromised blood supply to incarcerated bowel — surgical emergency
- **Richter hernia:** only antimesenteric border of bowel wall trapped (may strangulate without obstruction)

**Presentation:**
- Painful, tender, non-reducible groin, umbilical, or abdominal wall mass
- Nausea, vomiting (if bowel obstruction present)
- Obstipation, abdominal distension (if SBO develops)
- Duration < 24 hours: higher likelihood of successful manual reduction
- Duration > 24 hours: increased strangulation risk

**Strangulation signs (emergent surgery required):**
- Continuous severe pain (not colicky)
- Overlying skin erythema, warmth, induration
- Fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis
- Signs of systemic sepsis
- Peritonitis

**Common hernia types:**
- Inguinal (75% of all hernias): indirect > direct
- Femoral (more common in women, highest strangulation rate — 30-40%)
- Incisional/ventral
- Umbilical
- Obturator (rare; presents with Howship-Romberg sign — inner thigh pain with hip rotation)

## Critical Actions

1. **Assess for strangulation** — if present, proceed directly to emergent surgery
2. **If NO signs of strangulation:** attempt manual reduction (taxis) within 24 hours of symptom onset
3. **IV fluid resuscitation** — isotonic crystalloid
4. **NPO** — anticipate surgery
5. **Analgesia and sedation for reduction attempt:** morphine 0.1 mg/kg IV or ketamine 0.3 mg/kg IV for procedural sedation
6. **Manual reduction technique:** Trendelenburg position, gentle sustained pressure on the most distal portion of the hernia toward the neck of the defect; apply ice pack to reduce edema
7. **If reduction fails or strangulation suspected:** emergent surgical consultation
8. **Broad-spectrum antibiotics** if strangulation suspected: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h
9. **Type and screen**

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Reducible hernia** — non-tender, reducible mass that increases with Valsalva
- **Inguinal lymphadenopathy** — firm, non-reducible, no cough impulse; may be tender if infected
- **Testicular torsion** — absent cremasteric reflex, high-riding testis, Doppler shows absent flow
- **Epididymitis** — tender epididymis, positive Prehn sign, gradual onset
- **Groin abscess/hidradenitis** — fluctuant mass with overlying skin changes, fever
- **Undescended testis** — groin mass in child, empty hemiscrotum
- **Femoral artery aneurysm** — pulsatile mass

## Workup

- **Clinical diagnosis is primary** — imaging should not delay surgical intervention
- **Point-of-care ultrasound:** identify hernia contents (bowel vs omentum), assess bowel wall thickness and peristalsis, Doppler flow to incarcerated bowel
- **CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast (if diagnosis uncertain):**
  - Identify hernia type and contents
  - Assess bowel wall enhancement (absent = strangulation)
  - Detect closed-loop SBO
  - Free fluid, mesenteric haziness suggest ischemia
  - Transition point at hernia neck
- **Labs:** CBC (leukocytosis with strangulation), BMP, lactate (elevated suggests ischemia), coagulation studies, type and screen
- **Abdominal X-ray:** dilated small bowel loops if SBO present; may miss diagnosis

## Treatment

**Manual reduction (non-strangulated, < 24 hours):**
- Position: Trendelenburg (30 degrees)
- Apply ice to hernia for 15-20 minutes to reduce edema
- Procedural sedation: midazolam 2-4 mg IV + fentanyl 50-100 mcg IV, or ketamine 1 mg/kg IV
- Technique: gentle constant pressure on the most distal aspect, guide contents through the defect
- Success rate: approximately 60-75%
- Post-reduction: observe 4-6 hours, arrange urgent elective hernia repair

**Surgical management (emergent):**
- **Indications:** strangulation suspected, failed manual reduction, peritonitis, bowel obstruction
- Inguinal: open anterior approach (most common) or laparoscopic (TEP/TAPP)
- Femoral: infra-inguinal (Lockwood) or preperitoneal (McEvedy) approach
- Assess bowel viability: resect necrotic bowel with primary anastomosis or diversion
- Mesh repair: generally safe even in clean-contaminated field; avoid mesh if frank peritonitis or gross contamination

**Antibiotics:**
- Pre-operative: cefazolin 2 g IV (prophylaxis for clean repair)
- Strangulated/contaminated: piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV q6h
- Duration: 24 hours prophylaxis (clean); 5-7 days (contaminated/bowel resection)

**Post-reduction (successful manual reduction):**
- Observe 4-6 hours for recurrence, pain, vomiting
- Diet advancement as tolerated
- Arrange urgent surgical follow-up for elective repair within 2-4 weeks
- Return precautions: irreducibility, severe pain, vomiting, fever

## Disposition

- **Emergent OR:** strangulation, failed reduction, peritonitis, bowel obstruction
- **Observation (4-6 hours):** successful manual reduction — monitor for recurrence, tolerate diet
- **Discharge after successful reduction:** if tolerating diet, no recurrence, reliable follow-up within 2-4 weeks for elective repair
- **Admit:** failed reduction awaiting semi-urgent surgery, significant comorbidities, poor social situation

## Pitfalls

1. **Attempting manual reduction of a strangulated hernia.** Reducing gangrenous bowel into the abdomen risks perforation, peritonitis, and sepsis. Strangulation signs (erythema, systemic toxicity, peritonitis) mandate surgery without reduction attempt.

2. **Femoral hernia misdiagnosed as inguinal.** Femoral hernias have the highest strangulation rate (30-40%). Location below the inguinal ligament, medial to the femoral vein. More common in women. Requires different surgical approach.

3. **Richter hernia missed because there is no bowel obstruction.** Only a portion of the bowel wall is trapped. Patient may not have vomiting or obstipation but can still strangulate. Maintain high suspicion with focal tenderness at hernia site.

4. **Reduction en masse.** The entire hernia sac including the constricting ring is reduced into the preperitoneal space. The bowel remains strangulated despite apparent reduction. Persistent pain after "successful" reduction requires CT and surgical consultation.

5. **Delayed surgical referral after successful reduction.** Recurrence rate is high. Elective repair must be arranged within 2-4 weeks. Document referral in ED chart.

6. **Obturator hernia missed on physical exam.** Presents with medial thigh pain (Howship-Romberg sign) and SBO in elderly thin women. Palpable mass is rare. CT is diagnostic.
