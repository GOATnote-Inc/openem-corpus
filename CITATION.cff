abstract: >-
  A structured, token-efficient corpus of 185 emergency medicine conditions
  designed for AI/LLM evaluation and safety research. Agent-compiled from
  clinical guidelines and PubMed literature, machine-validated through a
  13-check automated suite, and physician-reviewed for all high-acuity
  (risk tier A) conditions. Used by ScribeGoat2, LostBench, and SafeShift
  to evaluate whether LLMs maintain safety boundaries in emergency medicine
  conversations.
