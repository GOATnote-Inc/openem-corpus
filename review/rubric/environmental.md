## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Temperature Targets
- [ ] Heat stroke: cool to <39C (102.2F) within 30 min, target 38-38.5C
- [ ] Hypothermia: rewarm to >=35C (95F); avoid overshoot
- [ ] Malignant hyperthermia: cool to <38.5C, stop triggering agents immediately
- [ ] Submersion: maintain normothermia; prolonged resuscitation if cold water

### Rewarming Protocols (Hypothermia)
- [ ] Mild (32-35C): passive external rewarming (warm blankets, warm environment)
- [ ] Moderate (28-32C): active external rewarming (forced warm air, warm IV fluids 40-42C)
- [ ] Severe (<28C): active internal rewarming (warm lavage, ECMO/bypass for arrest)
- [ ] Handle gently (avoid triggering dysrhythmias in severe hypothermia)
- [ ] Withhold vasopressors and limit defibrillation attempts if core temp <30C

### Cooling Protocols (Heat Stroke)
- [ ] Cold water immersion as first-line (most effective, target cooling rate >0.1C/min)
- [ ] Evaporative cooling as alternative (mist + fan)
- [ ] Ice packs to axillae, groin, neck as adjunct
- [ ] Antipyretics are ineffective (not a hypothalamic set-point issue)
- [ ] Continuous core temperature monitoring (esophageal or rectal, not oral/axillary)

### Monitoring Parameters
- [ ] Continuous cardiac monitoring for hypothermia and electrical injury
- [ ] Serial electrolytes (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) for rhabdomyolysis risk
- [ ] CK and myoglobin for rhabdomyolysis (submersion, electrical, heat stroke)
- [ ] Coagulation studies for heat stroke (DIC risk)
- [ ] ECG for hypothermia (Osborn/J waves) and electrical injury

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] Malignant hyperthermia: dantrolene 2.5 mg/kg IV, repeat q5-10 min (no max in acute crisis)
- [ ] Submersion: aggressive ACLS, consider ECMO for refractory arrest in cold water
- [ ] High altitude: descent as primary treatment, dexamethasone for HACE, nifedipine for HAPE
- [ ] Chemical burns: copious water irrigation (except elemental metals), specific neutralizers avoided
- [ ] Electrical injury: ECG monitoring >=24 hr for high-voltage, evaluate for compartment syndrome

## Common Pitfalls
- Heat stroke: using antipyretics (ineffective, delays effective cooling)
- Hypothermia: aggressive ACLS drugs in severe hypothermia (ineffective <30C)
- Malignant hyperthermia: not stocking enough dantrolene (need 36+ vials = 720 mg for 80 kg)
- Submersion: premature termination of resuscitation in cold-water drowning
- Electrical injury: focusing on skin burns while missing internal injury and rhabdomyolysis

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Heat stroke entry without cold water immersion as first-line cooling
- Hypothermia entry without severity-stratified rewarming approach
- Malignant hyperthermia without dantrolene dosing and MHAUS protocol reference
- Submersion entry without prolonged resuscitation guidance for cold-water events
- Any entry using oral/axillary temperature for monitoring (unreliable in extremes)
- Electrical injury entry without rhabdomyolysis screening and cardiac monitoring duration
