## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Transfusion Targets and Ratios
- [ ] Massive transfusion ratio stated (1:1:1 PRBC:FFP:platelets)
- [ ] Activation criteria for MTP defined (ABC score >=2, clinical judgment, >10 units PRBC anticipated)
- [ ] Hemoglobin transfusion threshold: 7 g/dL (stable), 8-10 g/dL (active hemorrhage/ACS)
- [ ] Platelet transfusion threshold: <10K (prophylactic), <50K (active bleeding), <100K (CNS/eye surgery)
- [ ] Fibrinogen target >150-200 mg/dL (cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen concentrate)

### Component Therapy
- [ ] PRBC: one unit raises Hgb ~1 g/dL
- [ ] FFP: 10-15 mL/kg for factor replacement
- [ ] Platelets: one apheresis unit raises count ~30-50K
- [ ] Cryoprecipitate: 10 units for fibrinogen, factor VIII, vWF
- [ ] Tranexamic acid as adjunct (1 g IV, must be within 3 hr of bleeding onset)

### Anticoagulant Reversal
- [ ] Warfarin: vitamin K 10 mg IV + 4-factor PCC (25-50 U/kg based on INR)
- [ ] Heparin: protamine (1 mg per 100 units heparin given in last 2-3 hr)
- [ ] Dabigatran: idarucizumab 5 g IV
- [ ] Rivaroxaban/apixaban: andexanet alfa (or 4-factor PCC if unavailable)
- [ ] Enoxaparin: protamine (partial reversal, 1 mg per 1 mg enoxaparin if within 8 hr)
- [ ] Reversal agent availability caveats noted (andexanet alfa cost/availability)

### Transfusion Reactions
- [ ] Acute hemolytic reaction: stop transfusion, IV fluids, send blood bank samples
- [ ] TRALI: supportive care, no diuretics (distinguish from TACO)
- [ ] TACO: diuretics, slow/stop transfusion
- [ ] Febrile non-hemolytic: antipyretics, slower infusion rate
- [ ] Allergic: antihistamines for mild, epinephrine for anaphylactic

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] Sickle cell crisis: IV fluids, analgesia, transfusion for ACS/stroke (target Hgb S <30%)
- [ ] TLS: rasburicase for uric acid >8, aggressive hydration, avoid potassium/phosphate in IVF
- [ ] Neutropenic fever: blood cultures, empiric anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam within 1 hr
- [ ] DIC: treat underlying cause, component replacement (cryo for fibrinogen, platelets if <50K)

## Common Pitfalls
- Massive transfusion entry without calcium replacement (citrate toxicity causes hypocalcemia)
- Warfarin reversal with FFP alone (slow, volume-overloading; PCC is preferred)
- Sickle cell: over-transfusion beyond target (hyperviscosity risk)
- TLS: using allopurinol instead of rasburicase for established hyperuricemia
- Ordering type and screen but not activating MTP early enough

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- MTP entry without 1:1:1 ratio and calcium replacement protocol
- Anticoagulant reversal without agent-specific approach (generic "FFP" for all)
- Sickle cell entry without exchange transfusion indications (ACS, stroke, priapism >4 hr)
- TLS entry without rasburicase and contraindication for G6PD deficiency
- Neutropenic fever entry without 1-hour antibiotic target
- Any transfusion entry without transfusion reaction recognition and management
