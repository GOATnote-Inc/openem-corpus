## Category-Specific Review Checks

### NMS Management
- [ ] Offending agent discontinuation as first step
- [ ] Dantrolene dosing stated (1-2.5 mg/kg IV q5-10 min, max 10 mg/kg/day)
- [ ] Bromocriptine as adjunct (2.5 mg PO/NG q8h, titrate to 45 mg/day)
- [ ] Amantadine as alternative (100-200 mg PO/NG q12h)
- [ ] Aggressive cooling for hyperthermia (target <38.5C)
- [ ] Benzodiazepines for rigidity and agitation
- [ ] Avoid succinylcholine for intubation (hyperkalemia risk from rhabdomyolysis)

### Serotonin Syndrome
- [ ] Serotonergic agent discontinuation
- [ ] Cyproheptadine dosing (12 mg initial, then 2-4 mg q1-2h, max 32 mg/day; PO/NG only)
- [ ] Benzodiazepines for agitation and myoclonus
- [ ] Distinguish from NMS: onset (hours vs days), rigidity (clonus vs lead-pipe), reflexes (hyperreflexia vs normal/decreased)
- [ ] Avoid physical restraints that mask worsening hyperthermia

### Temperature Management
- [ ] Continuous core temperature monitoring for NMS and serotonin syndrome
- [ ] Active cooling for temp >41C (ice packs, evaporative cooling, cold IV fluids)
- [ ] Antipyretics are ineffective for NMS/serotonin syndrome (not hypothalamic set-point mediated)
- [ ] Paralysis with non-depolarizing agent for severe rigidity-driven hyperthermia (eliminates heat generation)
- [ ] Rhabdomyolysis monitoring (CK, renal function, urine output)

### Agitation Management
- [ ] De-escalation attempted first (verbal, environmental)
- [ ] IM medications for acute agitation: haloperidol 5 mg + lorazepam 2 mg + diphenhydramine 50 mg
- [ ] Alternative: olanzapine 10 mg IM (do NOT combine with IM benzodiazepines -- respiratory depression)
- [ ] Ketamine 4-5 mg/kg IM for severe undifferentiated agitation
- [ ] Physical restraints: time-limited, monitored, with concurrent chemical sedation

### Safety Assessment
- [ ] Suicidality screening tool referenced (Columbia C-SSRS or equivalent)
- [ ] Means restriction counseling documented
- [ ] Medical clearance before psychiatric disposition
- [ ] Involuntary hold criteria per jurisdiction acknowledged
- [ ] Re-assessment timing after chemical sedation

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing NMS with serotonin syndrome (different mechanisms, different treatments)
- Olanzapine IM + benzodiazepine IM combination (FDA black box warning)
- Using antipyretics for NMS/serotonin syndrome hyperthermia (ineffective)
- Succinylcholine in NMS (hyperkalemia from rhabdomyolysis)
- Discharging suicidal patient without documented safety plan and means restriction

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- NMS entry without dantrolene dosing and administration route
- Serotonin syndrome entry without cyproheptadine (only available PO/NG -- must note this)
- NMS/serotonin syndrome entries that do not clearly distinguish the two conditions
- Agitation entry without de-escalation as first step before medications
- Any entry recommending olanzapine IM with concurrent benzodiazepine IM
- Suicidality entry without safety planning and follow-up arrangement
- NMS/SS entries without rhabdomyolysis monitoring (CK, renal function)
