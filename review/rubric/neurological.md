## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Seizure Medication Dosing
- [ ] First-line benzodiazepine dose stated (lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV, max 4 mg/dose)
- [ ] Second-line agents with mg/kg dosing (levetiracetam 60 mg/kg, fosphenytoin 20 mg PE/kg, valproate 40 mg/kg)
- [ ] Infusion rates specified to avoid toxicity (fosphenytoin <=150 mg PE/min)
- [ ] Refractory SE management (midazolam or propofol drip, consider pentobarbital)
- [ ] Time benchmarks: benzo by 5 min, second-line by 20 min, third-line by 40 min

### Herniation Signs
- [ ] Clinical signs enumerated (unilateral fixed dilated pupil, Cushing triad, posturing)
- [ ] Emergent interventions listed (HOB 30 degrees, mannitol 1 g/kg or 23.4% saline, hyperventilation to pCO2 30-35)
- [ ] Hyperventilation noted as temporizing only (not sustained)
- [ ] Neurosurgical consultation trigger clearly stated

### Thrombolytic Eligibility (Stroke)
- [ ] tPA window stated (<=4.5 hr from last known well)
- [ ] Absolute and relative contraindications listed
- [ ] Extended window considerations (thrombectomy <=24 hr with perfusion imaging)
- [ ] Alteplase dose (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg; 10% bolus, remainder over 60 min)
- [ ] BP threshold pre-tPA (<185/110) and post-tPA (<180/105)

### Blood Pressure Targets
- [ ] Hemorrhagic stroke: SBP target <140 mmHg (per AHA/ASA)
- [ ] SAH: SBP <160 mmHg until aneurysm secured
- [ ] Ischemic stroke (no tPA): permissive hypertension <220/120
- [ ] Agent selection specified (nicardipine, labetalol, clevidipine)

### Neurosurgical Indications
- [ ] SAH: early aneurysm repair (coil vs clip) timing stated
- [ ] Hemorrhagic stroke: EVD for hydrocephalus, hematoma evacuation criteria
- [ ] Epidural/subdural: surgical evacuation thresholds (size, midline shift)
- [ ] Cavernous sinus thrombosis: anticoagulation even with hemorrhagic infarct

## Common Pitfalls
- Status epilepticus dosing without mg/kg (adult-only fixed doses miss pediatric patients)
- tPA contraindication list that is outdated (INR threshold, time window)
- Hemorrhagic stroke entry that omits anticoagulant reversal (warfarin, DOACs)
- SAH management that skips nimodipine for vasospasm prophylaxis
- Herniation management that lists hyperventilation without the "temporizing" caveat

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Stroke entry without last-known-well documentation emphasis
- SE entry without time-based escalation protocol
- SAH entry missing Hunt-Hess or Fisher grading
- Any BP target without specifying the clinical context (pre/post tPA, hemorrhagic vs ischemic)
- GBS entry without respiratory monitoring (FVC threshold <20 mL/kg for intubation)
- Cauda equina without specifying MRI urgency and surgical timing (<48 hr)
