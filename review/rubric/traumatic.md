## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Hemorrhage Control Priorities
- [ ] MARCH/CABCDE sequence referenced (massive hemorrhage first)
- [ ] Direct pressure, tourniquet, wound packing as immediate interventions
- [ ] Tourniquet application: high and tight, time documented, no removal in field
- [ ] Junctional hemorrhage management (axillary, inguinal, cervical)
- [ ] Permissive hypotension target stated (SBP 80-90 mmHg, except TBI)

### Transfusion Ratios
- [ ] Balanced resuscitation: 1:1:1 PRBC:FFP:platelets target ratio stated
- [ ] Massive transfusion protocol activation criteria (ABC score, SI >1, clinical judgment)
- [ ] Whole blood option referenced where available
- [ ] Tranexamic acid within 3 hours of injury (1 g IV over 10 min, then 1 g over 8 hr)
- [ ] Calcium replacement with massive transfusion (1 g CaCl per 4 units PRBC)

### Imaging Decision Points
- [ ] FAST exam indications and limitations stated
- [ ] CT pan-scan criteria for blunt trauma
- [ ] Imaging should not delay OR in unstable penetrating trauma
- [ ] Repeat imaging indications (clinical deterioration, unclear initial findings)
- [ ] C-spine clearance protocol referenced (NEXUS or Canadian C-spine)

### Damage Control Resuscitation
- [ ] Principles: limit crystalloid, permissive hypotension, hemostatic resuscitation
- [ ] Damage control surgery trigger criteria (lethal triad: hypothermia, acidosis, coagulopathy)
- [ ] Temporary closure, ICU resuscitation, planned re-exploration sequence
- [ ] Goal-directed reversal of coagulopathy (TEG/ROTEM if available)

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] TBI: avoid hypotension (SBP >100) and hypoxia, ICP management, no permissive hypotension
- [ ] Pelvic fracture: binder placement, angioembolization indications, preperitoneal packing
- [ ] Aortic transection: BP control (SBP <100, HR <80), definitive repair (endovascular preferred)
- [ ] Spinal cord injury: MAP target >=85 mmHg for 5-7 days, methylprednisolone controversial
- [ ] Penetrating chest: tube thoracostomy output thresholds for thoracotomy (>1500 mL or >200 mL/hr)

## Common Pitfalls
- Crystalloid-heavy resuscitation without early blood products
- TBI management with permissive hypotension (contraindicated -- maintain SBP >100)
- Pelvic fracture managed with only fluids and no mechanical stabilization
- Aortic transection entry without immediate BP control as first priority
- Fat embolism syndrome diagnosed late (triad: petechiae, neurologic changes, respiratory distress at 24-72 hr)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Hemorrhagic shock entry without massive transfusion protocol activation criteria
- TBI entry that does not distinguish it from general hemorrhagic shock BP targets
- Penetrating chest trauma without clear OR indications (output thresholds)
- Spinal cord injury without MAP augmentation target
- Any trauma entry that relies on imaging before stabilization in unstable patient
- Epidural/subdural entries without surgical evacuation criteria (size, midline shift >5 mm)
