# Review Rubric: Respiratory

## Applicable Conditions

### Tier A (must review)
- epiglottitis
- massive-hemoptysis
- pulmonary-embolism
- tension-pneumothorax
- tracheal-disruption

### Tier B
- acute-asthma-exacerbation, copd-exacerbation, foreign-body-aspiration,
  pneumonia, spontaneous-pneumothorax

## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Airway Decision Points
- [ ] Indications for intubation clearly stated (failure to protect, failure to oxygenate/ventilate)
- [ ] Epiglottitis: minimal manipulation, preparation for surgical airway, avoid blind attempts
- [ ] Anticipated difficult airway triggers listed (stridor, neck swelling, facial trauma)
- [ ] RSI agent selection with condition-specific considerations (ketamine for bronchospasm, avoid succinylcholine in hyperkalemia)

### Ventilator Settings
- [ ] Initial settings specified: mode, tidal volume (6-8 mL/kg IBW), rate, FiO2, PEEP
- [ ] Condition-specific adjustments (low rate + long expiratory time for obstructive disease)
- [ ] Plateau pressure target (<30 cmH2O)
- [ ] ABG/VBG reassessment timing after initiation (15-30 min)

### Non-Invasive Ventilation
- [ ] NIV indications per condition (COPD exacerbation, acute pulmonary edema, immunocompromised)
- [ ] NIV contraindications listed (inability to protect airway, hemodynamic instability, facial trauma)
- [ ] Initial BiPAP settings suggested (IPAP 10-12, EPAP 5, titrate)
- [ ] Failure criteria and time to reassess (1-2 hr trial, then intubate if no improvement)

### Adjunct Therapies
- [ ] Bronchodilators: continuous vs intermittent nebulization criteria
- [ ] Systemic steroids: dose and timing for asthma/COPD (methylprednisolone 125 mg IV or equivalent)
- [ ] Epinephrine for severe bronchospasm (IM 0.3-0.5 mg or nebulized racemic)
- [ ] Heliox consideration for upper airway obstruction
- [ ] Anticoagulation for PE (heparin dosing, thrombolysis criteria)

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] Tension pneumothorax: needle decompression site AND chest tube (needle is temporizing)
- [ ] Massive hemoptysis: affected side down, selective intubation, bronchoscopy, IR embolization
- [ ] PE: risk stratification (Wells, PERC), thrombolysis for massive PE (alteplase 100 mg IV)
- [ ] Tracheal disruption: maintain spontaneous ventilation, avoid positive pressure, surgical consultation

## Common Pitfalls
- Tension pneumothorax treated with needle decompression alone (chest tube is definitive)
- PE entry that does not stratify sub-massive vs massive management
- Epiglottitis entry that recommends standard RSI without surgical airway backup
- Asthma entry without magnesium sulfate as adjunct for severe exacerbation
- Tracheal disruption managed with positive pressure ventilation (can worsen injury)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Tension pneumothorax entry without immediate decompression as first step (before imaging)
- PE entry missing thrombolysis indications and contraindications for massive PE
- Any airway entry without failed-airway backup plan
- Ventilator settings without IBW-based tidal volume calculation
- Massive hemoptysis without airway protection and lateralization strategy
- Foreign-body aspiration without rigid bronchoscopy as definitive intervention
