# Review Rubric: Procedural

## Applicable Conditions

### Tier A (must review)

- lateral-canthotomy
- perimortem-cesarean-delivery
- reboa
- resuscitative-thoracotomy
- surgical-cricothyrotomy

## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Equipment Lists
- [ ] Required equipment enumerated (not vague "standard surgical kit")
- [ ] Critical instruments highlighted (scalpel size, catheter type, balloon size)
- [ ] Backup/alternative equipment noted (bougie for airway, finger thoracostomy vs tube)
- [ ] Point-of-care ultrasound role specified where applicable

### Contraindications
- [ ] Absolute contraindications clearly labeled and separated from relative
- [ ] Resuscitative thoracotomy: blunt arrest >10 min, penetrating >15 min (relative)
- [ ] REBOA: zone-specific contraindications, suspected thoracic aortic injury
- [ ] Perimortem cesarean: <20 weeks gestational age, known non-viable fetus

### Complication Rates
- [ ] Major complications listed with approximate frequency where evidence exists
- [ ] Cricothyrotomy: false passage, posterior tracheal wall injury, hemorrhage
- [ ] Lateral canthotomy: globe injury, incomplete decompression
- [ ] REBOA: limb ischemia, aortic injury, distal embolization

### Step-by-Step Technique
- [ ] Numbered procedural steps (not narrative paragraphs)
- [ ] Anatomical landmarks explicitly described
- [ ] Patient positioning stated
- [ ] Confirmation of success criteria (e.g., air movement for cric, ROSC timing for thoracotomy)
- [ ] Time-critical benchmarks (perimortem cesarean: delivery within 5 min of arrest)

### Alternatives and Escalation
- [ ] Surgical airway alternatives (needle cricothyrotomy as bridge, video laryngoscopy)
- [ ] When to abandon procedure and escalate (failed cric -> tracheostomy)
- [ ] Decision points between procedure and definitive surgical care
- [ ] Team roles during procedure (who does what)

### Procedure-Specific
- [ ] Breech delivery: Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver, Piper forceps for aftercoming head
- [ ] Difficult airway: ASA/DAS algorithm referenced, can't intubate/can't oxygenate pathway
- [ ] REBOA: zone I vs zone III placement, fluoroscopy vs landmark, partial vs full occlusion
- [ ] Resuscitative thoracotomy: left anterolateral approach, pericardiotomy, aortic cross-clamp

## Common Pitfalls
- Technique description without anatomical landmarks (useless under stress)
- Perimortem cesarean entry that waits for fetal assessment (goal is maternal resuscitation)
- Cricothyrotomy listed as "last resort" without specifying the failed-airway trigger
- REBOA without ischemia time limits and partial occlusion option
- Equipment lists that assume OR-level availability in ED setting

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Any procedure entry without numbered steps
- Resuscitative thoracotomy without survival data context (penetrating vs blunt)
- Perimortem cesarean without the 4-minute decision-to-incision target
- Difficult airway entry that does not address the can't-intubate-can't-oxygenate pathway
- Lateral canthotomy without IOP measurement as indication (>40 mmHg or clinical signs)
- Procedure entry without complication recognition and management
