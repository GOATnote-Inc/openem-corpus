## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Weight-Based Dosing
- [ ] All medication doses expressed as mg/kg (or mcg/kg)
- [ ] Maximum single dose and daily dose caps stated (adult ceiling)
- [ ] Common weight estimation method referenced when weight unknown (Broselow, age-based)
- [ ] Fluid bolus volume specified (20 mL/kg NS, reassess; 10 mL/kg for neonates/cardiac)

### Maximum Adult Dose Caps
- [ ] Each drug with a weight-based dose also lists the absolute max
- [ ] Examples verified: epinephrine max 0.3 mg (peds IM), amoxicillin max 3 g/day
- [ ] Acetaminophen dosing does not exceed 75 mg/kg/day or 4 g/day

### Age-Appropriate Vital Signs
- [ ] Normal ranges provided by age group (neonate, infant, toddler, school-age, adolescent)
- [ ] Hypotension defined by age (SBP <60 neonate, <70 infant, <70 + 2x age for 1-10 yr)
- [ ] Tachycardia thresholds age-specific (not adult thresholds applied to children)
- [ ] Respiratory rate norms by age referenced

### Equipment Sizing
- [ ] Broselow tape or length-based system referenced for emergent sizing
- [ ] ETT size formula stated (age/4 + 3.5 cuffed, age/4 + 4 uncuffed)
- [ ] Blade size, suction catheter, IV/IO needle by age or weight
- [ ] IO access as first-line vascular access if IV fails within 90 seconds

### Resuscitation
- [ ] Epinephrine dose for cardiac arrest (0.01 mg/kg = 0.1 mL/kg of 1:10,000 IV/IO)
- [ ] Defibrillation dose (2 J/kg first, 4 J/kg subsequent)
- [ ] Glucose: D10W for neonates (2-5 mL/kg), D25W for infants/children (2-4 mL/kg)
- [ ] Fluid resuscitation with reassessment after each bolus (avoid over-resuscitation)

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] NEC: feeding cessation, abdominal decompression, broad-spectrum abx, surgical triggers
- [ ] IEM crisis: stop protein intake, dextrose infusion, ammonia-lowering agents
- [ ] Neonatal emergencies: ductal-dependent lesions and prostaglandin E1 dosing (0.05-0.1 mcg/kg/min)

## Common Pitfalls
- Using adult drug doses without pediatric adjustment
- Applying adult vital sign thresholds to children (misses compensated shock)
- IV fluid bolus without specifying volume per kg (vague "bolus of NS")
- Omitting IO access as a rapid alternative when IV is difficult
- Febrile seizure entry that over-investigates simple febrile seizures

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Any dose listed without mg/kg AND adult max cap
- Neonatal entry missing prostaglandin E1 for ductal-dependent lesions
- NEC entry without pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous gas as key imaging findings
- Kawasaki entry without IVIG timing (within 10 days of fever onset) and aspirin dosing
- Non-accidental trauma entry without mandatory reporting language and skeletal survey indication
- Intussusception entry without air/contrast enema as diagnostic AND therapeutic
