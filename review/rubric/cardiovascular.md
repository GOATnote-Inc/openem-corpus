## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Reperfusion Timing
- [ ] Door-to-balloon target stated (<=90 min PCI, <=120 min transfer)
- [ ] Door-to-needle target for fibrinolytics (<=30 min) if PCI unavailable
- [ ] Time window for thrombolytic eligibility explicitly bounded (<=12h symptom onset)

### Anticoagulation Dosing
- [ ] Heparin dosing is weight-based (e.g., 60 U/kg bolus, 12 U/kg/hr)
- [ ] Maximum bolus and infusion caps stated (typically 4,000 U / 1,000 U/hr)
- [ ] Enoxaparin renal adjustment noted (CrCl <30 mL/min)

### Antiplatelet Therapy
- [ ] Loading doses specified (ASA 325 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg or ticagrelor 180 mg)
- [ ] Contraindications to dual antiplatelet noted (active bleeding, planned CABG)
- [ ] Timing relative to PCI vs fibrinolysis distinguished

### Hemodynamic Targets
- [ ] MAP target stated where applicable (>=65 mmHg general; specific per condition)
- [ ] SBP target for aortic dissection (<120 mmHg, HR <60)
- [ ] Vasopressor/inotrope first-line agent specified

### ECG Interpretation
- [ ] STEMI criteria defined (>=1 mm in 2 contiguous leads, >=2 mm in V1-V3)
- [ ] STEMI equivalents listed (de Winter, Wellens, posterior MI, LBBB + Sgarbossa)
- [ ] Rhythm-specific management steps (VT: synchronized vs unsynchronized)

### Procedural Interventions
- [ ] Pericardiocentesis indications for tamponade stated
- [ ] Transcutaneous pacing indications and settings for bradycardia
- [ ] ROSC post-arrest care checklist (TTM, cath lab, neuro prognosis)

## Common Pitfalls
- Omitting weight-based heparin caps (overdose risk in obese patients)
- Failing to distinguish type A vs type B aortic dissection management
- Missing posterior STEMI (no ST elevation in standard leads)
- Not specifying rate-vs-rhythm control decision criteria for AF/RVR
- Listing PCI times without addressing transfer/rural scenarios

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Any anticoagulation dose without weight basis or renal adjustment
- STEMI management that omits STEMI equivalents entirely
- Cardiac arrest algorithm that skips reversible causes (Hs and Ts)
- Aortic dissection entry without anti-impulse therapy targets
- SCAD entry that recommends standard ACS anticoagulation (contraindicated)
- Hemodynamic targets without specifying measurement method (arterial line vs cuff)
