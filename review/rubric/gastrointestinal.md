# Review Rubric: Gastrointestinal

## Applicable Conditions

### Tier A (must review)
- esophageal-perforation
- mesenteric-ischemia

### Tier B
- acute-pancreatitis, ascending-cholangitis, bowel-obstruction,
  esophageal-foreign-body-impaction, gi-hemorrhage

## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Surgical Consultation Indications
- [ ] Esophageal perforation: emergent surgical consult stated (within 24 hr for best outcomes)
- [ ] Mesenteric ischemia: "time is bowel" urgency communicated
- [ ] Bowel obstruction: strangulation signs triggering emergent surgery (fever, peritonitis, WBC, lactate)
- [ ] GI hemorrhage: surgical/IR backup for failed endoscopic hemostasis
- [ ] Free air on imaging: immediate surgical consultation

### Perforation Signs
- [ ] Pneumomediastinum/pneumoperitoneum as key imaging findings
- [ ] Esophageal perforation: subcutaneous emphysema, Hamman sign, pleural effusion
- [ ] CT with water-soluble contrast as diagnostic study (not barium if perforation suspected)
- [ ] Pain out of proportion as a clinical red flag (mesenteric ischemia, strangulated bowel)
- [ ] Peritoneal signs: rigidity, guarding, rebound tenderness

### Ischemia Markers
- [ ] Lactate elevation as late and nonspecific marker (do not rely on normal lactate to exclude)
- [ ] CT angiography as first-line imaging for suspected mesenteric ischemia
- [ ] Mesenteric ischemia types distinguished: arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, venous thrombosis, NOMI
- [ ] D-dimer: sensitive but nonspecific for mesenteric venous thrombosis
- [ ] Acidosis, leukocytosis, and elevated LDH as supporting (not diagnostic) labs

### Resuscitation and Stabilization
- [ ] NPO status for all potential surgical conditions
- [ ] Fluid resuscitation and electrolyte correction before OR
- [ ] Broad-spectrum antibiotics for perforation and ischemia (cover anaerobes + gram-negatives)
- [ ] Nasogastric decompression for obstruction
- [ ] Blood product preparation for GI hemorrhage (type and crossmatch, consider MTP)

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] GI hemorrhage: Glasgow-Blatchford or Rockall score for risk stratification
- [ ] Ascending cholangitis: Tokyo criteria, ERCP within 24 hr (emergent if septic)
- [ ] Pancreatitis: Ranson/BISAP for severity, no prophylactic antibiotics for sterile necrosis
- [ ] Esophageal FB: button battery is emergent (tissue necrosis within 2 hr)
- [ ] Boerhaave syndrome: left-sided pleural effusion and history of forceful vomiting

## Common Pitfalls
- Normal lactate used to exclude mesenteric ischemia (lactate rises late)
- Barium swallow ordered when perforation is suspected (use water-soluble contrast)
- Pancreatitis entry recommending prophylactic antibiotics (not indicated for sterile necrosis)
- GI hemorrhage entry without risk stratification score
- Button battery foreign body triaged as non-urgent (emergent removal required)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Mesenteric ischemia entry without CTA as primary imaging modality
- Esophageal perforation entry without emergent surgical consultation
- Bowel obstruction entry without strangulation warning signs
- GI hemorrhage without massive transfusion activation criteria for severe bleeding
- Cholangitis entry without ERCP timing based on severity
- Any surgical abdomen entry that delays resuscitation or consultation for additional labs
