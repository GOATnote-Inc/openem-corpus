- anaphylaxis
- angioedema

## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Epinephrine Dosing
- [ ] IM epinephrine as FIRST-LINE stated unambiguously (not antihistamines, not steroids)
- [ ] Adult dose: 0.3-0.5 mg IM (1:1,000 = 1 mg/mL concentration)
- [ ] Pediatric dose: 0.01 mg/kg IM, max 0.3 mg
- [ ] Injection site: lateral thigh (vastus lateralis)
- [ ] Repeat dosing: q5-15 min if no improvement
- [ ] IV epinephrine for refractory anaphylaxis: 0.1 mg (1:10,000) slow push or infusion (NOT IM concentration IV)

### Concentration Clarity
- [ ] IM concentration (1:1,000 = 1 mg/mL) distinguished from IV concentration (1:10,000 = 0.1 mg/mL)
- [ ] Auto-injector doses referenced (EpiPen 0.3 mg adult, 0.15 mg pediatric)
- [ ] No ambiguity between IM and IV dosing that could lead to 10x dosing error

### Biphasic Reactions
- [ ] Biphasic anaphylaxis risk stated (up to 20% of cases, typically 1-72 hr)
- [ ] Minimum observation period: 4-6 hr (longer for severe reactions, prior biphasic)
- [ ] Discharge criteria specified (symptom-free, access to epinephrine auto-injector)
- [ ] Patient education on biphasic risk at discharge

### Refractory Anaphylaxis
- [ ] IV epinephrine infusion protocol for persistent hypotension
- [ ] Adjunct vasopressors (norepinephrine, vasopressin) for epinephrine-resistant shock
- [ ] Glucagon for patients on beta-blockers (1-5 mg IV over 5 min)
- [ ] Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation (1-2 L NS bolus for adults)
- [ ] Consider methylene blue for refractory vasodilatory shock

### Angioedema-Specific
- [ ] Hereditary vs acquired vs ACE-inhibitor-induced distinguished
- [ ] ACE-inhibitor angioedema: stop ACE-I, epinephrine may be less effective
- [ ] Hereditary angioedema: C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate, icatibant, ecallantide
- [ ] Airway assessment and intubation threshold clearly stated
- [ ] FFP as bridge therapy if specific HAE treatments unavailable

### Supportive Measures
- [ ] H1 and H2 blockers as adjuncts (not first-line)
- [ ] Corticosteroids: may reduce biphasic risk but no immediate effect (not a substitute for epi)
- [ ] Albuterol for bronchospasm as adjunct
- [ ] Trendelenburg position for hypotension

## Common Pitfalls
- Listing antihistamines or steroids before epinephrine (delays life-saving treatment)
- Confusing IM and IV epinephrine concentrations (10x dosing error risk)
- Angioedema entry that does not distinguish mechanism (histaminergic vs bradykinin-mediated)
- Short observation period without biphasic reaction counseling
- Discharging without epinephrine auto-injector prescription and allergy referral

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Epinephrine NOT listed as first intervention for anaphylaxis
- IM and IV epinephrine concentrations not explicitly differentiated
- Observation period <4 hours after anaphylaxis treatment
- Angioedema entry without airway management as primary concern
- HAE entry that relies on antihistamines/steroids (ineffective for bradykinin-mediated)
- Refractory anaphylaxis without IV epinephrine infusion and vasopressor escalation
