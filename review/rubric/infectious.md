# Review Rubric: Infectious

## Applicable Conditions

### Tier A (must review)
- bacterial-meningitis
- cerebral-malaria
- ludwigs-angina
- necrotizing-fasciitis
- sepsis
- toxic-shock-syndrome

### Tier B
- dengue-hemorrhagic-fever, hsv-encephalitis, infective-endocarditis,
  malignant-otitis-externa, retropharyngeal-abscess, spinal-epidural-abscess, tetanus

## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Empiric Antibiotic Timing
- [ ] "Within 1 hour" of recognition stated for sepsis and meningitis
- [ ] Specific time targets referenced (Surviving Sepsis Campaign, IDSA)
- [ ] Door-to-antibiotic metric acknowledged as quality measure
- [ ] Do-not-delay principle: antibiotics before imaging when indicated

### Cultures Before Antibiotics
- [ ] Blood cultures x2 from separate sites before abx stated
- [ ] CSF cultures for meningitis (if LP will not delay abx >45 min)
- [ ] Caveat: do NOT delay antibiotics for cultures in unstable patients
- [ ] Gram stain and culture from surgical site for nec fasc / abscess

### Source Control
- [ ] Surgical consultation timing for necrotizing fasciitis (emergent debridement)
- [ ] Abscess drainage indications (Ludwig's, retropharyngeal, epidural abscess)
- [ ] Line removal for line-associated infections
- [ ] Imaging modality for source identification (CT with contrast, MRI for epidural)

### Empiric Regimen Selection
- [ ] Regimen appropriate for suspected organisms (not just "broad-spectrum")
- [ ] MRSA coverage indications stated (vancomycin for nec fasc, toxic shock)
- [ ] Antifungal consideration in immunocompromised
- [ ] Local antibiogram reference encouraged

### Immunocompromised Considerations
- [ ] Broader empiric coverage specified for neutropenic/HIV/transplant patients
- [ ] Opportunistic infections flagged (PJP, CMV, fungal)
- [ ] Atypical presentations noted (afebrile sepsis, minimal leukocytosis)
- [ ] Steroid use impact on presentation and lab values

### Adjunctive Therapies
- [ ] Dexamethasone for bacterial meningitis (before or with first abx dose)
- [ ] IVIG for toxic shock syndrome
- [ ] Clindamycin for toxin suppression (nec fasc, TSS)

## Common Pitfalls
- Listing antibiotic regimens without specifying dose or frequency
- Meningitis entry that delays LP and abx for CT (give abx first if CT needed)
- Necrotizing fasciitis diagnosis relying solely on imaging (clinical diagnosis, do not delay OR for CT)
- Sepsis bundle missing lactate measurement and reassessment at 3-6 hr
- Omitting dexamethasone timing for meningitis (must be before or concurrent with abx)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Any entry recommending antibiotics "after" imaging without the delay caveat
- Sepsis entry without 30 mL/kg crystalloid bolus or vasopressor escalation pathway
- Meningitis entry missing age-based empiric regimen differences (neonates, >50 yr)
- Nec fasc entry without emergent surgical consultation as a core step
- Ludwig's airway entry that omits fiberoptic intubation / surgical airway backup
- TSS entry that does not distinguish staphylococcal from streptococcal management
