## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Triage Algorithms
- [ ] SALT (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving interventions, Treatment/transport) described
- [ ] START (Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment) criteria stated
- [ ] Color-coded categories defined (immediate/red, delayed/yellow, minor/green, expectant/black)
- [ ] Triage decision points: walking, breathing, respiratory rate, pulse/perfusion, mental status
- [ ] Pediatric modification noted (JumpSTART for age <8)

### Resource Allocation
- [ ] Surge capacity principles referenced
- [ ] Altered standards of care framework mentioned
- [ ] Expectant category criteria defined (injuries incompatible with survival given resources)
- [ ] Reassessment/retriage intervals stated

### ICS Structure
- [ ] Incident Command System roles referenced (IC, operations, planning, logistics, finance)
- [ ] Medical branch structure: triage, treatment, transport
- [ ] Unified command for multi-agency events
- [ ] Communication protocols (radio channels, runner systems as backup)

### Decontamination Protocols
- [ ] Gross decontamination described (remove clothing = ~80% reduction)
- [ ] Wet decontamination procedure (water + mild soap, head-to-toe)
- [ ] Decon before entry to treatment area (upwind, uphill)
- [ ] PPE levels for responders specified by agent type
- [ ] Chemical-specific neutralization agents noted where applicable

### Blast Injury
- [ ] Primary (blast wave), secondary (fragments), tertiary (displacement), quaternary (other) classified
- [ ] Blast lung criteria and management (low tidal volume, avoid positive pressure if possible)
- [ ] TM rupture as marker of significant blast exposure
- [ ] Delayed presentation of blast bowel injury noted

### Radiation
- [ ] Acute radiation syndrome phases (prodromal, latent, manifest, recovery/death)
- [ ] Lymphocyte count at 48 hr as prognostic marker
- [ ] KI (potassium iodide) for radioiodine exposure timing
- [ ] Internal vs external contamination management distinguished

### Crush Syndrome
- [ ] Aggressive IV fluids BEFORE extrication (1-1.5 L/hr NS)
- [ ] Hyperkalemia management (calcium, insulin/glucose, bicarb, kayexalate)
- [ ] Cardiac monitoring during and after extrication
- [ ] Rhabdomyolysis with target UOP >200-300 mL/hr

## Common Pitfalls
- Applying individual patient standard-of-care thinking to MCI (resource allocation differs)
- Crush syndrome: releasing trapped limb without pre-hydration (reperfusion arrest)
- Blast injury: focusing on external wounds and missing primary blast lung or bowel injury
- Chemical MCI: allowing contaminated patients into treatment area
- Radiation: conflating contamination (external, removable) with irradiation (exposure, not transmissible)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- MCI entry without explicit triage algorithm (SALT or START)
- Crush syndrome without pre-extrication fluid bolus protocol
- Chemical MCI without decontamination-before-treatment sequencing
- Active shooter entry without "Stop the Bleed" / hemorrhage control emphasis
- Blast injury entry that omits primary blast injury patterns (lung, bowel, ear)
- Any entry that does not address resource-limited decision-making
