## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Electrolyte Correction Rates
- [ ] Sodium: max correction rate stated (<=10 mEq/L per 24 hr; <=8 for high-risk ODS)
- [ ] Potassium: IV rate limits (10 mEq/hr peripheral, 20 mEq/hr central; cardiac monitoring >10)
- [ ] Calcium: correction for albumin or use ionized calcium
- [ ] Phosphate: replacement threshold and rate (severe <1.0, IV repletion over 6 hr)
- [ ] Magnesium: replacement dose (1-2 g IV over 1-2 hr for symptomatic)

### Monitoring Intervals
- [ ] DKA: BMP q2h (glucose, K+, bicarb, anion gap) until gap closed
- [ ] HHS: glucose q1h, sodium correction tracking, osmolality
- [ ] Hyperkalemia: continuous cardiac monitoring, repeat K+ after each intervention
- [ ] Thyroid storm: serial vitals q15-30 min during acute management
- [ ] Adrenal crisis: BP and glucose monitoring q15 min until stable

### Insulin Protocols
- [ ] DKA: 0.1 U/kg/hr IV infusion (or 0.14 U/kg/hr without bolus)
- [ ] Glucose target descent rate: 50-75 mg/dL/hr
- [ ] Switch to D5 when glucose <200-250 mg/dL (continue insulin until gap closed)
- [ ] HHS: lower insulin rate, focus on fluid resuscitation first
- [ ] Subcutaneous overlap: 2 hr overlap before discontinuing drip

### Stress-Dose Steroids
- [ ] Adrenal crisis: hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, then 50 mg IV q8h (or 200 mg/24h continuous)
- [ ] Do NOT wait for cortisol results before treating suspected adrenal crisis
- [ ] Stress-dose indications beyond adrenal crisis: septic shock refractory to vasopressors
- [ ] Taper plan mentioned (not abrupt discontinuation)

### Condition-Specific
- [ ] Hyperkalemia: temporizing (calcium, insulin/glucose, bicarb, albuterol) vs removal (kayexalate, dialysis)
- [ ] Thyroid storm: Burch-Wartofsky score, treatment order (beta-blocker, PTU, iodine 1 hr after PTU, steroids)
- [ ] Pheochromocytoma: alpha-blockade BEFORE beta-blockade (unopposed alpha if reversed)
- [ ] DKA: potassium replacement before insulin if K+ <3.3

## Common Pitfalls
- DKA: starting insulin before checking and replacing potassium (risk of fatal hypokalemia)
- HHS: treating like DKA (HHS needs more aggressive fluids, less aggressive insulin)
- Hyperkalemia: relying on kayexalate alone (slow onset, temporizing measures first)
- Thyroid storm: giving iodine before thionamide (iodine first can worsen storm)
- Sodium correction too rapid in chronic hyponatremia (osmotic demyelination)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- DKA entry without potassium check/replace before insulin
- HHS entry without free water deficit calculation and osmolality monitoring
- Hyperkalemia entry without calcium as first intervention for ECG changes
- Adrenal crisis entry that delays steroids for diagnostic testing
- Thyroid storm without sequential medication ordering (beta-blocker, PTU, THEN iodine)
- Pheochromocytoma entry that uses beta-blockers before alpha-blockade
- Any electrolyte correction without maximum rate and monitoring interval
