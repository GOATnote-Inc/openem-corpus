## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Antidote Dosing
- [ ] Dose, route, and max dose specified for each antidote
- [ ] Weight-based dosing with adult caps (e.g., naloxone 0.04-2 mg IV, atropine 2 mg IV)
- [ ] Repeat dosing intervals and criteria for redosing stated
- [ ] Antidote availability caveats noted (hydroxocobalamin, fomepizole, Digibind)

### Decontamination
- [ ] Activated charcoal timing window stated (generally <=1-2 hr post-ingestion)
- [ ] Contraindications listed (caustics, hydrocarbons, unprotected airway)
- [ ] Whole bowel irrigation indications noted (sustained-release, body packing)
- [ ] Gastric lavage: explicitly limited or discouraged per current guidelines

### Toxidrome Recognition
- [ ] Classic toxidrome features tabulated (vitals + pupils + skin + neuro)
- [ ] Distinguishing features between similar toxidromes (anticholinergic vs sympathomimetic)
- [ ] Mixed ingestion considerations noted

### Elimination Enhancement
- [ ] Urinary alkalinization indications (salicylates, methotrexate)
- [ ] Hemodialysis indications with specific thresholds (methanol >25 mg/dL, lithium >4 mEq/L)
- [ ] Multi-dose activated charcoal candidates listed (theophylline, carbamazepine, dapsone)

### Observation Periods
- [ ] Minimum observation time stated per ingestion type
- [ ] Delayed toxicity agents flagged (acetaminophen, sustained-release, MAOI, colchicine)
- [ ] Extended monitoring for opioid overdose (>=4 hr for long-acting, renarcotization risk)

## Common Pitfalls
- Naloxone dosing that starts too high (risk of acute withdrawal, aspiration)
- Omitting fomepizole timing relative to ethanol level and dialysis
- Activated charcoal recommended for caustic ingestion (contraindicated)
- Missing the acetaminophen nomogram time dependency (4-hr post-ingestion level)
- Not distinguishing ethylene glycol vs methanol clinical features and osmolal gap

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Any antidote listed without dose AND route AND max
- Organophosphate entry without pralidoxime timing window (<=24-48 hr)
- Cyanide entry missing empiric dosing for smoke inhalation (hydroxocobalamin 5g IV)
- TCA entry without sodium bicarbonate threshold (QRS >100 ms)
- Beta-blocker/CCB entries without high-dose insulin euglycemia protocol
- Observation period shorter than known delayed-toxicity window for the agent
