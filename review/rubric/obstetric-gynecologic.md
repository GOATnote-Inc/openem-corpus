## Category-Specific Review Checks

### Magnesium Sulfate
- [ ] Loading dose stated (4-6 g IV over 20-30 min)
- [ ] Maintenance infusion rate (1-2 g/hr)
- [ ] Toxicity thresholds documented (loss of reflexes >7 mEq/L, respiratory depression >10, cardiac arrest >15)
- [ ] Antidote for Mg toxicity stated (calcium gluconate 1 g IV)
- [ ] Monitoring: reflexes, respiratory rate, urine output, Mg levels

### Gestational Age Cutoffs
- [ ] Viability threshold stated (23-24 weeks per institutional policy)
- [ ] Cutoffs affecting management decisions explicit (steroids 24-34 wk, tocolytics <34 wk)
- [ ] Perimortem cesarean timing (<=4-5 min from arrest if >=20 wk)

### Fetal Monitoring
- [ ] Category I/II/III tracing definitions referenced
- [ ] Indications for continuous monitoring stated
- [ ] Intrauterine resuscitation steps (position, fluids, O2, tocolysis)

### Uterotonic Agents
- [ ] Oxytocin dose and route for PPH (10-40 U IV infusion)
- [ ] Second-line agents listed (methylergonovine, carboprost, misoprostol)
- [ ] Contraindications per agent (methylergonovine in HTN, carboprost in asthma)

### Rh Status
- [ ] RhoGAM indication noted for Rh-negative patients with bleeding
- [ ] Dose specified (300 mcg IM standard; 50 mcg if <12 wk)
- [ ] Kleihauer-Betke for large-volume fetomaternal hemorrhage mentioned

### Hemorrhage Management
- [ ] Quantitative blood loss measurement referenced
- [ ] Massive transfusion protocol activation criteria stated
- [ ] Surgical/interventional escalation pathway (B-Lynch, balloon tamponade, IR embolization, hysterectomy)

## Common Pitfalls
- Omitting Mg toxicity monitoring parameters (reflexes are the earliest clinical sign)
- Failing to specify gestational age thresholds that change management
- PPH management that jumps to surgery without stepwise uterotonic escalation
- Eclampsia entry that prioritizes antihypertensives over seizure control (Mg first)
- HELLP entry without platelet threshold for regional anesthesia (typically >=70,000)

## Red Flags for Reviewers
- Any eclampsia/preeclampsia entry without Mg sulfate as first-line
- Ectopic pregnancy entry missing hemodynamic instability criteria for OR vs MTX
- Cord prolapse without specifying manual elevation and positioning
- PPH entry without quantified blood loss thresholds for escalation
- Peripartum cardiomyopathy missing ejection fraction criteria and contraindicated meds (ACE-I in pregnancy)
- Amniotic fluid embolism without DIC management and supportive care emphasis
