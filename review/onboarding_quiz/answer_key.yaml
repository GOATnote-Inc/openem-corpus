      - id: alpha-1
        type: dose-error
        severity: critical
        section: Critical Actions
        location: "Step 5: 'Epinephrine 0.5 mg IV for cardiac arrest'"
        description: >
          Wrong epinephrine dose for cardiac arrest. The ACLS cardiac arrest
          dose is epinephrine 1 mg IV/IO push every 3-5 minutes (2020 AHA
          Guidelines). The 0.3-0.5 mg dose is for anaphylaxis (IM route),
          not cardiac arrest. Using 0.5 mg IV in a cardiac arrest risks
          inadequate resuscitation.
        expected_finding: >
          Epinephrine dose should be 1 mg IV/IO for cardiac arrest per
          2020 AHA ACLS guidelines.

      - id: alpha-2
        type: dose-error
        severity: critical
        section: Critical Actions
        location: "Step 4: 'midazolam 5 mg or lorazepam 2 mg IV'"
        description: >
          Missing route on midazolam. The entry lists "midazolam 5 mg" without
          specifying the route (IV, IM, or IN). The corpus standard requires
          every drug dose to include route (REVIEWING.md Section 3, Critical
          Actions item 5). Lorazepam in the same line correctly specifies "IV"
          but midazolam does not.
        expected_finding: >
          Midazolam dose is missing its route. Should specify IV or IM
          (e.g., "midazolam 5 mg IV" or "midazolam 10 mg IM").

      - id: alpha-3
        type: hedging
        severity: major
        section: Critical Actions
        location: "Critical Actions table, row 4: 'Consider early intubation for airway protection'"
        description: >
          Hedging language in Critical Actions. The word "consider" violates
          the corpus standard (REVIEWING.md Section 3, Critical Actions item 3):
          "Actions are imperative — no hedging ('consider', 'may want to')."
          Critical Actions must use directive language.
        expected_finding: >
          Hedging language "consider early intubation" violates corpus standard.
          Should be imperative: "Intubate early for airway protection" or
          "Perform early intubation for airway protection."

      - id: alpha-4
        type: schema-error
        severity: major
        section: Frontmatter
        location: "icd10: [R68.0, G93.4X]"
        description: >
          Invalid ICD-10-CM code. "G93.4X" is not a valid ICD-10-CM code.
          Valid codes in the G93.4 family include G93.40 (Encephalopathy,
          unspecified), G93.41 (Metabolic encephalopathy), G93.49 (Other
          encephalopathy). The trailing "X" placeholder is not valid for
          this code family in ICD-10-CM.
        expected_finding: >
          G93.4X is not a valid ICD-10-CM code. Should be a specific code
          such as G93.40 or G93.49.

      - id: alpha-5
        type: dangerous-omission
        severity: critical
        section: Treatment
        location: >
          Dantrolene and Cyproheptadine subsection, final bullet: "Do NOT
          combine dantrolene and cyproheptadine — dantrolene potentiates
          serotonergic crisis through calcium-mediated 5-HT release
          amplification."
        description: >
          Fabricated drug interaction. There is no established clinical
          contraindication to combining dantrolene and cyproheptadine.
          Dantrolene is a ryanodine receptor antagonist (reduces intracellular
          calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum); cyproheptadine is a
          serotonin receptor antagonist. They act on entirely different
          pathways. The claimed "calcium-mediated 5-HT release amplification"
          mechanism is fabricated. This false contraindication could cause a
          clinician to withhold cyproheptadine from a serotonin syndrome
          patient who also needs dantrolene for rhabdomyolysis, resulting
          in patient harm.
        expected_finding: >
          The dantrolene-cyproheptadine interaction is fabricated. No
          established contraindication exists. This false warning could
          cause a clinician to withhold necessary treatment.

    errors:

      - id: beta-1
        type: outdated-guideline
        severity: major
        section: Frontmatter (sources)
        location: >
          First source: "2008 AASLD Practice Guidelines: Management of Adult
          Patients with Ascites Due to Cirrhosis"
        description: >
          Outdated primary guideline. The 2008 AASLD guidelines have been
          superseded by the 2021 AASLD Guidance on AKI and HRS-AKI (Biggins
          SW, et al. Hepatology. 2021). The RED_TEAM_CHECKLIST requires at
          least one source from the last 5 years (>= 2021). While the 2012
          and 2015 sources are acceptable supporting references, having a
          2008 guideline as the primary source for a condition compiled in
          2026 is below the corpus currency standard.
        expected_finding: >
          Primary guideline is from 2008, superseded by 2021 AASLD guidance.
          Corpus standard requires at least one source from >= 2021.

      - id: beta-2
        type: missing-contraindication
        severity: critical
        section: Critical Actions
        location: >
          Step 6: "Administer ketoconazole 200 mg PO daily as hepatoprotective
          adjunct"
        description: >
          Ketoconazole is hepatotoxic and carries an FDA black box warning for
          serious hepatotoxicity, including fatal cases. It is contraindicated
          in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Recommending
          ketoconazole as a "hepatoprotective adjunct" in a patient with
          advanced hepatic failure is directly contradicted by the drug's
          safety profile and is dangerous. This drug should not appear in
          this treatment protocol.
        expected_finding: >
          Ketoconazole is hepatotoxic (FDA black box warning) and
          contraindicated in liver disease. Labeling it "hepatoprotective"
          in a hepatorenal crisis patient is dangerous and should be removed.

      - id: beta-3
        type: content-completeness
        severity: major
        section: Pitfalls
        location: "Entire Pitfalls section — only 3 pitfalls listed"
        description: >
          Insufficient pitfalls count. The review rubric (REVIEWING.md
          Section 3, Pitfalls item 1) requires "at least 7 pitfalls for
          tier A conditions." This condition is risk_tier A (ESI 1) but
          lists only 3 pitfalls. Missing pitfalls could include: not
          monitoring serial creatinine, overlooking hepatic encephalopathy
          management, failing to assess transplant candidacy early, using
          excessive crystalloid instead of albumin, and missing drug-induced
          nephrotoxicity as a cause.
        expected_finding: >
          Only 3 pitfalls for a risk_tier A condition. Rubric requires >= 7.

      - id: beta-4
        type: terminology
        severity: major
        section: Frontmatter
        location: "time_to_harm: 'variable'"
        description: >
          Vague time_to_harm value. The RED_TEAM_CHECKLIST explicitly
          prohibits vague values like "variable", "depends", or "varies"
          for time_to_harm. For a risk_tier A condition, the schema
          convention requires the structured object form with
          irreversible_injury, death, and optimal_intervention_window
          fields. Even the string form must provide a specific time
          window (e.g., "< 48 hours" or "< 2 weeks").
        expected_finding: >
          time_to_harm is "variable" — too vague. Should use structured
          object form for tier A, or at minimum a specific time window.

    condition: Acute Neurovascular Compression Syndrome
    total_errors: 0
    description: >
      This condition is CLEAN. It contains no planted errors. All drug doses
      include routes, time targets are specific, Critical Actions use
      imperative language without hedging, ICD-10 codes are valid (G54.0,
      G54.1), sources include a 2024 guideline (meeting the currency
      requirement), and the Pitfalls section has 9 items. This condition
      is risk_tier B, so the 7-pitfall minimum for tier A does not strictly
      apply (though it exceeds it regardless).
    expected_finding: "No issues found."
    notes: >
      This condition tests the reviewer's false-positive rate. A reviewer
      who reports issues on this file is generating false positives, which
      counts against their false-positive rate threshold (< 20%).

scoring:
  total_errors: 9
  pass_threshold_sensitivity: 0.80
  pass_threshold_false_positive_rate: 0.20
  minimum_correct_to_pass: 8  # ceil(9 * 0.80) = 8

  scoring_rules:
    - >
      A finding counts as "correctly identified" if the reviewer identifies
      the correct location AND the correct general category of error, even
      if the explanation differs from this answer key.
    - >
      Partial credit (0.5): identifying the correct section but describing
      the wrong specific issue within that section.
    - >
      False positives: any reported issue that does not correspond to a
      planted error in this answer key. Includes issues flagged on
      quiz-condition-gamma.md (the clean file).
    - >
      Sensitivity = (correctly identified errors) / 9.
    - >
      False-positive rate = (false positives) / (total findings reported).
    - >
      Both thresholds must be met simultaneously to pass.
