# Acute Neurovascular Compression Syndrome

## Recognition

**Definition:** Acute neurovascular compromise due to external or internal compression of peripheral nerves and vessels within a confined anatomic compartment. The syndrome encompasses the pathophysiologic continuum from early nerve compression (reversible neuropraxia) through ischemic nerve and muscle injury when intracompartmental pressure exceeds perfusion pressure.

**Mechanism:** Rising intracompartmental pressure reduces the arteriovenous gradient across the capillary bed. When compartment pressure exceeds capillary perfusion pressure (typically within 10-30 mmHg of diastolic blood pressure), tissue ischemia begins. Muscle is more sensitive than nerve: irreversible muscle necrosis begins at 4-6 hours of ischemia; nerve injury at 6-8 hours.

**Clinical features (6 P's -- listed in approximate order of onset):**
1. **Pain** out of proportion to injury -- earliest and most reliable sign. Worsened by passive stretch of muscles in the affected compartment.
2. **Pressure** -- compartment feels tense and firm on palpation.
3. **Paresthesias** -- altered sensation in the distribution of nerves traversing the compartment. Indicates nerve ischemia.
4. **Paresis** -- weakness or inability to move the affected extremity. Late sign indicating significant muscle ischemia.
5. **Pallor** -- skin pallor or mottling over the compartment. Variable and unreliable.
6. **Pulselessness** -- absent distal pulses. Very late sign; compartment syndrome is a clinical diagnosis before pulses are lost. Waiting for pulselessness guarantees tissue loss.

**Key principle:** A palpable distal pulse does NOT exclude compartment syndrome. Compartment pressure can exceed capillary perfusion pressure while arterial inflow is preserved. Pain with passive stretch in a tense compartment is sufficient for diagnosis.

**Common anatomic locations:**
- Leg (anterior compartment most common): tibial fractures, crush injuries
- Forearm (volar compartment): supracondylar fractures, radius/ulna fractures
- Thigh: femoral fractures, anticoagulation with hematoma
- Hand (interosseous compartments): crush injuries
- Foot: Lisfranc injuries, calcaneal fractures
- Gluteal compartment: prolonged immobilization (found-down patients)

## Critical Actions

| Action | Target |
|---|---|
| Clinical assessment (pain, pressure, passive stretch) | Immediate |
| Remove all circumferential dressings, casts, splints | Immediate |
| Compartment pressure measurement (if diagnosis uncertain) | < 15 minutes |
| Surgical consultation for fasciotomy | < 30 minutes |
| Fasciotomy | < 6 hours from symptom onset |

1. Remove all circumferential dressings, casts, splints, and constrictive clothing immediately. This alone can reduce compartment pressure by 40-65%.
2. Position the affected limb at the level of the heart (not elevated -- elevation reduces arterial perfusion pressure without meaningfully reducing compartment pressure).
3. Measure compartment pressure using a Stryker needle manometer or arterial line transducer if diagnosis is uncertain:
   - Absolute pressure > 30 mmHg: concerning
   - Delta pressure (diastolic BP minus compartment pressure) < 30 mmHg: indication for fasciotomy
4. Obtain emergent surgical consultation for fasciotomy. Do not delay for imaging.
5. Optimize systemic perfusion: IV fluid resuscitation, maintain MAP > 65 mmHg (hypotension worsens the compartment pressure-perfusion mismatch).
6. Analgesia: fentanyl 25-50 mcg IV q5-10min titrated to pain control. Avoid regional nerve blocks (mask evolving neurologic signs).
7. Prepare for rhabdomyolysis: aggressive IV NS (target UOP 1-2 mL/kg/hr), monitor CK and potassium.

## Differential Diagnosis

- Acute arterial occlusion (absent pulse, no compartment tenseness, Doppler confirms absent flow)
- Deep vein thrombosis (swelling, tenderness, but compartment is soft and pain is not worsened by passive stretch)
- Peripheral nerve injury (sensory/motor deficit without compartment tenseness or pain with stretch)
- Cellulitis (erythema, warmth, fever -- compartment is not tense)
- Necrotizing fasciitis (erythema extending beyond compartment boundaries, crepitus, systemic toxicity, pain out of proportion)
- Fracture pain (pain at fracture site, not worsened by passive stretch of compartment muscles remote from fracture)
- Rhabdomyolysis without compartment syndrome (diffuse myalgias, elevated CK, soft compartments)
- Myositis (inflammatory muscle pain, elevated ESR/CRP, soft compartments)

## Workup

- **Compartment pressure measurement:** Stryker needle or arterial line transducer. Measure all compartments of the affected extremity. Delta pressure < 30 mmHg is the threshold for fasciotomy.
- **BMP:** potassium (hyperkalemia from muscle necrosis), creatinine, BUN, glucose
- **CK:** baseline and serial q6-12h (rhabdomyolysis monitoring)
- **CBC:** WBC (infection), hemoglobin (hemorrhage into compartment)
- **Coagulation studies:** PT/INR, PTT (anticoagulation-related hematoma)
- **Urinalysis:** myoglobinuria (tea-colored urine, positive for blood on dipstick but no RBCs on microscopy)
- **Lactate:** tissue ischemia
- **Type and screen:** in case surgical blood loss
- **X-rays of affected extremity:** fracture identification
- **Doppler ultrasound:** if arterial occlusion is in the differential (but do not delay fasciotomy for imaging)
- **CT angiography:** only if acute arterial occlusion is primary concern and compartment syndrome has been excluded

## Treatment

### Fasciotomy

- **Definitive treatment.** Decompression of all affected compartments.
- **Timing:** within 6 hours of symptom onset for best outcomes. Fasciotomy after 12 hours of ischemia has poor outcomes and higher amputation rates.
- **Leg (4 compartments):** dual-incision technique -- anterolateral incision (anterior + lateral compartments) and medial incision (superficial posterior + deep posterior compartments).
- **Forearm (3 compartments):** volar curvilinear incision (volar compartment) + dorsal incision if needed. Carpal tunnel release included.
- **Wounds left open:** vacuum-assisted closure or vessel loop shoelace technique. Delayed primary closure or skin grafting at 48-72 hours.

### Medical Management (Adjunctive, Never a Substitute for Fasciotomy)

- **Analgesia:** IV opioids titrated to effect. Pain is the key monitoring parameter -- do not mask it with excessive dosing before surgical decision-making is complete. Avoid NSAIDs (renal risk with rhabdomyolysis).
- **IV fluid resuscitation:** NS at 1-2 mL/kg/hr minimum, increase to maintain UOP 200-300 mL/hr if CK > 5,000 (rhabdomyolysis protocol).
- **Sodium bicarbonate:** 150 mEq in 1 L D5W if urine pH < 6.5 and CK > 10,000 (urine alkalinization for myoglobin protection).
- **Hyperkalemia management:** calcium gluconate 10% 10 mL IV over 2-3 min (cardiac membrane stabilization), insulin 10 units IV + dextrose 25 g IV, sodium bicarbonate 50 mEq IV, kayexalate 15-30 g PO or PR. Emergent dialysis if refractory.
- **Mannitol:** 1-2 g/kg IV. Osmotic diuretic that reduces compartment edema and promotes renal myoglobin clearance. Evidence is limited; some centers use it as an adjunct but it does not replace fasciotomy.

### Postoperative Care

- Return to OR at 48-72 hours for wound assessment and delayed closure.
- Continue rhabdomyolysis monitoring (CK trending, renal function, electrolytes).
- Physical therapy and rehabilitation planning early.
- Monitor for complications: infection, chronic pain, contracture, nerve deficit.

## Disposition

- **Confirmed or suspected compartment syndrome:** emergent surgical consultation and OR. Do not admit to a facility without surgical capability.
- **Elevated compartment pressures with delta pressure 30-35 mmHg:** serial clinical exams q1-2h with repeat pressure measurements. Admit to a monitored surgical bed.
- **Post-fasciotomy:** ICU or surgical step-down for hemodynamic monitoring, rhabdomyolysis management, and planned return to OR.
- **Anticoagulation-related compartment hematoma:** reverse anticoagulation (vitamin K, PCC, protamine as appropriate), surgical consultation.
- **Found-down patient with prolonged immobilization:** high suspicion for gluteal and lower extremity compartment syndrome. Check all compartments. Aggressive rhabdomyolysis prophylaxis regardless of compartment pressures.

## Pitfalls

1. **Waiting for pulselessness to diagnose compartment syndrome.** Pulselessness is a very late finding that indicates arterial compromise. By the time pulses are lost, irreversible muscle and nerve necrosis has already occurred. Pain with passive stretch in a tense compartment is sufficient for diagnosis.

2. **Elevating the limb above the heart.** Limb elevation reduces arterial perfusion pressure and worsens ischemia. The limb should be positioned at the level of the heart -- not above it.

3. **Relying on a single compartment pressure measurement.** Compartment syndrome can involve any compartment. All compartments of the affected extremity must be measured. The leg has 4 compartments; missing the deep posterior compartment is a common error.

4. **Performing regional nerve blocks.** Regional anesthesia masks the evolution of pain and paresthesias, which are the key clinical monitoring parameters. Use IV opioids for analgesia instead.

5. **Delaying fasciotomy for confirmatory imaging.** Compartment syndrome is a clinical and pressure-based diagnosis. CT, MRI, and Doppler studies are unnecessary and delay definitive treatment. If clinical suspicion is high and delta pressure is low, proceed to fasciotomy.

6. **Not suspecting compartment syndrome in found-down patients.** Prolonged immobilization (> 4 hours) on a hard surface compresses gluteal and leg compartments. Every found-down patient needs compartment assessment, CK, and rhabdomyolysis monitoring.

7. **Attributing all pain to the fracture.** Fracture pain is localized to the injury site. Compartment syndrome pain is diffuse across the compartment and worsened by passive stretch of muscles remote from the fracture. This distinction is critical and frequently missed.

8. **Giving NSAIDs for pain control.** NSAIDs impair renal prostaglandin-mediated autoregulation, worsening myoglobin-induced nephrotoxicity. Use IV opioids for analgesia in suspected compartment syndrome.

9. **Fasciotomy after 12 hours of ischemia without careful risk-benefit analysis.** Late fasciotomy (> 12 hours) has high complication rates including reperfusion injury, life-threatening hyperkalemia, and sepsis from necrotic tissue. The decision to decompress versus amputate requires senior surgical judgment.
