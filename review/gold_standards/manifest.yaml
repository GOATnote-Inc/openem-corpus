# Gold Standard Manifest
#
# Registry of gold standard conditions seeded into the live review queue.
# CONFIDENTIAL: Do not share with reviewers.
#
# Gold standards are seeded at ~8% rate, indistinguishable from real
# assignments. They calibrate reviewer accuracy over time.
#
# Distribution target: 40% clean / 30% boundary / 20% genuine_issue / 10% confusion_pair
#
# See README.md in this directory for full documentation.

# Tracking thresholds
thresholds:
  alpha_acceptable: 0.67       # Krippendorff's alpha -- below this triggers rubric clarification
  alpha_critical: 0.50         # Below this triggers retraining
  sensitivity_minimum: 0.80    # Per-reviewer minimum on genuine_issue gold standards
  false_positive_maximum: 0.20 # Per-reviewer maximum on clean gold standards
  min_assignments_for_eval: 5  # Minimum gold standard assignments before evaluating a reviewer

gold_standards:
  # Placeholder -- actual gold standards are created from real conditions
  # that have been independently verified by 2+ physicians.
